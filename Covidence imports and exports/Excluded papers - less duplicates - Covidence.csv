Economic Analysis on Farmers' Professional Cooperatives in China--Evidence from CHIP 2002 Rural Household Survey. (In Chinese. With English summary.),"[; '; H; o; k; e; n; ,;  ; i; s; a; t; h; S; r; ]","Agricultural cooperatives in China, known as Farmers' Professional Cooperatives (FPCs), are becoming popular and have been intensely promoted by the Chinese government to facilitate agro-industrialization of small farmers. This paper investigates the impacts of the participation in FPCs on farm income by dividing rural households into two village groups (whether villages were designated as ""agricultural model villages"") as well as controlling endogenous bias of participation. Estimated results show that the economic impacts of the participation in agricultural model villages are much larger than those in other villages, since agricultural related services offered by FPCs in appear to be more standardized in agricultural model villages.",2016,,Economic Review (Keizai Kenkyu),67,1,Jan-16,,,,#5811,[ 2016,Exclusion reason: Full text not available; ,
Local gender contract and adaptive capacity in smallholder irrigation farming: a case study from the Kenyan drylands,"[; '; C; a; r; e; t; ,;  ; M; A; B; o; j; s; n; L; ]","This article presents the local gender contract of a smallholder irrigation farming community in Sibou, Kenya. Women's role in subsistence farming in Africa has mostly been analyzed through the lens of gender division of labor. In addition to this, we used the concept of 'local gender contract' to analyze cultural and material preconditions shaping gender-specific tasks in agricultural production, and consequently, men's and women's different strategies for adapting to climate variability. We show that the introduction of cash crops, as a trigger for negotiating women's and men's roles in the agricultural production, results in a process of gender contract renegotiation, and that families engaged in cash cropping are in the process of shifting from a 'local resource contract' to a 'household income contract.' Based on our analysis, we argue that a transformation of the local gender contract will have a direct impact on the community's adaptive capacity climate variability. It is, therefore, important to take the negotiation of local gender contracts into account in assessments of farming communities' adaptive capacity.",2015,,GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE,22,5,644-661,,10.1080/0966369X.2014.885888,,#5815,[ 2015,Exclusion reason: Does not focus on outcomes from a case study; ,

Contract farming can produce substantial income gains for farmers. Moreover, these benefits may well be required for contract farming schemes to survive. Better‐off farmers are most likely to participate in contract farming schemes.What is this review about?Contract farming is a sales arrangement agreed before production begins, which provides the farmer with resources or services. The service package provided by the firm varies per location, and can include transport, certification, input provisioning and credit.This systematic review summarises evidence on income effects for smallholders to assess average effects and explore combinations of factors that increase these effects.What studies are included?Included studies had to examine the impact of contract farming on income and food security of smallholder farmers in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Studies had to use a comparison group with appropriate statistical methods to allow for selection effects.Seventy‐five studies were identified with quantitative estimates of the impact of contract farming of which 22 studies, covering 7,471 respondents, were of sufficient rigour to include in the meta‐analysis of income effects. The meta‐analysis covers 26 empirical instances of contract farming in 13 developing countries.What is the aim of this review?This Campbell systematic review examines the impact of contract farming on income and food security of smallholder farmers in low‐ and middle‐income countries. The review summarises findings from 75 reports, of which 22 (covering 26 contract farming interventions) were used for meta‐analysis.What are the main findings of this review?Contract farming may substantially increase farmer income with an average effect in the range of 23 to 54 per cent. There is upward bias in the estimate because of survivor bias in individual studies (no data on farmers who drop out of schemes) and in the body of evidence (no studies on contract farming arrangements that collapsed in their initial years), and publication bias in the literature (under‐reporting of insignificant outcomes). Therefore, some caution is needed in interpreting the findings.For farmers to give up their autonomy in marketing and prevent side‐selling, substantial income gains need to be offered. This is especially so for annual crops and when firms have contracts directly with farmers rather than through a cooperative.Poorer farmers are not usually part of contract farming schemes. In 61% of the cases, contract farmers had significantly larger landholdings or more assets than the average farmers in the region.What do the findings of this review mean?Contract farming covers a wide range of contractual arrangements. This heterogeneity makes it difcult to draw general conclusions from the literature published on this topic. The lack of studies on ‘failed treatments’ leads to an overestimation of the effectiveness of contract farming.Moreover, the analysis suggests a marked publication bias; all studies report on at least one case of contract farming that has a positive and statistical significant income effect.Relatively larger or richer farmers can cope better with these risks and are, therefore, more likely to take part in a contractual arrangement. This implies that contract farming is more suited to the relatively better‐off segment of the farming population.Further research should: (1) improve reporting of the intervention; (2) document the less‐successful instances of contract farming, and report inconclusive results (insignificant effects); and (3) capture other outcomes of contract farming such as (sector‐wide) innovation, and livelihood resilience.How up‐to‐date is this review?The review authors searched for studies published up to October 2015. This Campbell systematic review was published in December 2017.Executive summary/AbstractBackgroundContract farming is used by an increasing number of firms as a preferred modality to source products from smallholder farmers in low and middle‐income countries. Quality requirements of consumers, economies of scale in production or land ownership rights are common incentives for firms to offer contractual arrangements to farmers. Prices and access to key technology, key inputs or support services are the main incentives for farmers to enter into these contracts. There is great heterogeneity in contract farming, with differences in contracts, farmers, products, buyers, and institutional environments. The focus of this review lies on contract farming, defined as:“a contractual arrangement for a fixed term between a farmer and a firm, agreed verbally or in writing before production begins, which provides material or financial resources to the farmer and specifies one or more product or process requirements for agricultural production on land owned or controlled by the farmer, which gives the firm legal title to (most of) the crop or livestock” (Adapted from Prowse, 2012:12).The last decade shows a rapid increase in studies that use quasi‐experimental research designs to assess the effects of specific empirical instances of contract farming on smallholders. The objective of this systematic review was to distill generalised inferences from this rapidly growing body of evidence.ObjectivesThe review synthesised the studies in order to answer two questions:• Question 1: What is known about the effect size of contract farming on income and food security of smallholder farmers in low‐ and middle‐income countries?• Question 2: Under which enabling or limiting conditions are contract farming arrangements effective for improving income and food security of smallholdersSearch methodsA comprehensive electronic search was applied to Scopus, CAB Abstracts, Econlit, Web of Science, Tropag & Rural, and Agricola between 30 September and 21 October 2015. Snowballing the reference list in review articles and other repositories of research (e.g. worldwidescience.org, FAO, World Bank, Google Scholar) added more studies to the review. The search results were uploaded in EPPI Reviewer 4 and screened for relevance and the rigour of analysis of the effect estimates, in order to combine these results in a meta‐analysis of effectiveness. The main terms used to identify the pool of studies within which we expected to find studies that covered the effectiveness of contract farming arrangements were: contract farming, nucleus estate, cooperative, producer organisation, pre‐harvest agreement, value chain, farm‐firm, outgrower, and vertical integration.Selection criteriaEach study selected for the meta‐analysis was required to resolve the counterfactual, that is, to use a comparison group to mimic the expected situation of farmers not having a contract. When assessing net‐effects, the characteristics of groups with or without a contract needed to be fairly similar. Ideally, the only difference was the condition of having a contract or not. Because firms tend to offer contracts to farmers having certain characteristics and farmers self‐select when they accept or reject the offer, econometric methods are required to credibly assess the net‐effects of contract farming.To be included in the review, studies needed to analyse the impact of the intervention on income or food security of smallholder farmers. However, only one study was found with food security as an outcome variable (Bellemare & Novak, 2017); all other studies included focused on income effects. The review, therefore, has a focus on the income effects of contract farming and a meta‐analysis explored this outcome.Data collection and analysisThe electronic search retrieved 8,529 unique studies. After the full‐text screening, 195 studies were found to present research on contract farming. We excluded all papers that did not study the effectiveness of contract farming. The remaining set of papers was referred to as the core set and consisted of 75 studies that presented quantitative outcomes on smallholder farmers. Of the 75 studies in the core set, most did not meet the criteria for methodological and econometric rigour and had to be excluded from the meta‐analysis. The meta‐analysis was based on data from 22 studies, covering 28 empirical instances of contract farming, two of which had insufficient data to use in the meta‐analysis. The studies covered 7,471 respondents.ResultsWe applied meta‐analysis on the studies that reported income effects. Based on the significance levels and effect sizes, we showed that the set of studies selected for meta‐analysis suffered from publication bias. All studies reported at least one empirical instance with a statistically significant positive income effect. Test results suggested that studies with non‐significant effects of contract farming are likely to exist but are not reported in the academic literature. Studies also suffer from survivor bias. All studies are cross‐sectional studies that assess the effectiveness of the contractual arrangement at one moment in time, but only after the contractual arrangements had been in place for some years when these had already survived the start‐up problems. This implies that contractual arrangements that had ceased to function are absent in the literature. The publication and survivor bias detected in this review preclude strong conclusions on the income effects of contract farming arrangements.The one study that analysed effects on food security reported a positive result (the duration of the hungry season was 8% [95% confidence interval= 0%,15%] lower for farmers having a contract). The meta‐analysis of the 22 studies showed that the average income effect of participation in these contractual arrangement is highly heterogeneous. The (uncorrected) pooled average effect‐size on the proxy for income used in each study, computed in the meta‐analysis, indicated a 62 percent increase (95% confidence interval=40%, 87%) in income for contract farmers over incomes of non‐contract farmers. However, strong evidence for publication bias suggests that the true effect of contract farming is likely to be much lower, although still substantially higher than non‐contract farming. When we consider these studies representative for enduring contract farming arrangements in general, the pooled average income effect is estimated in 38% (95% confidence interval=23%, 54%).In almost two‐thirds of the studies, the contracted farmers proved to have significantly larger holdings or to be richer than the average farmers in the area. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon, as mentioned in the studies, is that there are lower transaction costs with increasing farm scale and the capacity of the better‐endowed farmers to bear the production and post‐harvest quality risks inherent to contract farming arrangements. In the four studies in which contract farmers had relatively smaller than average plot sizes, the income effects are relatively low.Authors’ conclusionsContract farming is a container concept that covers a wide range of contractual arrangements. This heterogeneity makes it difcult to draw general conclusions from the literature published on this topic. The studies have a marked publication bias. All studies report at least one case of contract farming that has a positive and statistical significant income effect. Moreover, due to limits inherent to the (cross‐sectional) study designs used in these investigations, the estimated effect size is upward biased. The lack of studies on ‘failed treatments’ leads to an overestimation of the effectiveness of contract farming.Nevertheless, the results of the meta‐analysis suggest that contract farming arrangements need to offer clear incentives to farmers in order to survive over time in the context of free entry and exit of farmers. We generated the hypothesis that relatively large positive effects on income may be a precondition for farmers to continue the contractual arrangements with the firm and give up their autonomy in marketing, production and quality control. High benefits are needed to keep an arrangement attractive and to prevent farmers from dropping out.Modest expectations and careful planning are needed for contract farming to be effective and sustainable. The practitioner‐oriented literature indicated the high risk of failure in the first years and stressed the need for adaptive management and mechanisms to settle disputes. Whereas it is unlikely that contract farming arrangements will on average result in the income effects that we derived from the meta‐analysis, it shows the need for substantial income effects for contract farming arrangements to survive over time. If farmers may opt out of a contract ‐ which was the case in all empirical instances covered by the studies except oil palm in Indonesia ‐ those contractual arrangements having low effects are likely to disappear or be amended, and negative effects on smallholder well‐being are unlikely.Contract farming is an institutional arrangement that may be attractive for farmers who want to get access to services or inputs that they cannot obtain in the traditional (spot) market, or reach markets that are more remunerative. Farmers who are able to enter a contract farming arrangement tend not to be the poorest farmers in their region. Both firms and farmers face risks of non‐compliance. Relatively larger or richer farmers can cope better with these risks and are, therefore, more likely to take part in a contractual arrangement. This implies that contract farming is more suited to the relatively better‐off segment of the farming population. For annual crops, a price premium seems to be a necessary component of the service package in order to result in high income effects for farmers, especially in situations where no cooperative is involved as an intermediary between the firm and the farmers.",2017,,Campbell Systematic Reviews,13,1,1-131,,https://doi.org/10.4073/csr.2017.13,,#5825,[ 2017,Exclusion reason: Does not focus on outcomes from a case study; ,
Smallholders' Preferences for Different Contract Farming Models: Empirical Evidence from Sustainable Certified Coffee Production in Vietnam,"[; '; A; n; h; ,;  ; N; H; B; o; k; e; l; m; a; W; T; u; g; D; M; i; V; ]","Contract farming is considered as institutional arrangements that manage the coordination of production and distribution between smallholder farmers and agro-industrial firms. Under the market reforms and industrialization process, contract farming links smallholder farmers to a better market through effective farming management and high-quality products. Despite the many benefits attributed to participation, the existing literature addresses the main issues that result in the opposing attitudes and motivations toward contract farming. This study therefore aims to analyze factors that influence the choices of smallholder farmers for different contract faming models using multinomial logistic (MNL) regression. Different contract attributes and socio-economic characteristics of farmer households are used as endogenous variables in the MNL model. Based on a research sample of 183 smallholder farmers involved in certified coffee production in Dak Lak province, Vietnam, the study revealed that there are different typologies of production contract including the informal model, intermediary model, and nucleus estate model. Significant factors that affect smallholders' preferences for different contract farming models are gender, farm size, the provision of inputs, price option, technical assistance, delivery schedule, and monitoring. Main issues that induce failures of contract farming are farmer's overdependence and the monopolistic power of industrial coffee firms in the nucleus estate model, as well as the information asymmetry in the informal model. In addition, a cost-benefit analysis symbolizes the role of the cooperative in the intermediary model, which is essential for augmenting win-win outcomes for smallholder farmers and industrial coffee firms.",2019,,SUSTAINABILITY,11,14,-,,10.3390/su11143799,,#5859,[ 2019,Exclusion reason: Only compares impacts from ancillary services from the value chain amongst participants; ,
Role of market participation on smallholder vegetable farmers' wellbeing: Evidence from matching approach in Eastern India,"[; '; D; e; y; ,;  ; S; i; n; g; h; P; K; ]","The study identifies determinants of vegetable farmers' market participation and evaluates their impact on households' welfare. In this study, we collected 175 cross-sectional household data and employed a probit regression model to identify the determinants of vegetable farmers' market participation. The study estimates the impact of market participation on households' income and per capita consumption using the propensity score matching approach (PSM). Subsequently, the study used the endogenous switch regression (ESR) model to control sample selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity. ESR also evaluates the robustness of PSM outcomes. Results from PSM and ESR approaches suggest that vegetable market participation positively and significantly impacts smallholders' income and consumption expenditure. The study rejects the null hypothesis that vegetable market participation does not significantly impact farmers' welfare. Results show that vegetable market participation increases the farmers' monthly income and annual per capita consumption expenditure on average by Indian rupee (INR) 8360 and INR 26,410, respectively. Findings also indicate that household size, distance to market, off-farm income, access to training, price information, vehicle ownership, and storage systems are critical determinants of vegetable farmers' market participation. Identified determinants may support policymakers in designing suitable agricultural marketing policies to reduce market entry barriers and motivate farmers for market participation.

Factors influencing the level of vegetable value chain participation and implications on smallholder farmers in Swayimane KwaZulu-Natal,"[; '; N; d; l; o; v; u; ,;  ; P; T; h; a; m; g; -; C; i; t; j; J; M; O; ]","Governments in less developed countries have identified the need to support smallholder farmers and intervene to alleviate poverty and positively contribute to household food security. In Africa, there has been a growing emphasis on value chain development so that smallholder farmers can benefit from participation in agricultural value chains. Smallholder farmers are however still faced with constraints that negatively influence their participation decisions and the level of participation in agricultural value chains. This study, therefore, investigated the factors that influence the level of value chain participation and implications on smallholder farmers in KwaZulu-Natal, Swayimane area. Primary data was collected from farming households selected through a purposive sampling technique. The data were analyzed using descriptive analysis and the nehurdle model. Results from the nehurdle model showed that the age of the respondent, marital status, farm income, household size, cooperative, market information, radio, extension officer, and formal education significantly influenced the participation decisions of smallholder farmers in agricultural value chains. The results further showed that off-farm income, marital status, cooperatives, access to credit, access to irrigation scheme, radio, extension officer, contact with non-government organizations, and formal education significantly influenced the level of value chain participation of the smallholder farmers. It can be concluded that the level of endowment in the physical, financial, and human resources influence participation. Further, the farmer's connectivity with the external world outside the village improves the outcomes and level of success. It is recommended that a market-led approach to farmer development be adopted to improve the commercial prospects of farmers whilst bolstering food security.",2021,,Land Use Policy,109,,1-,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105611,,#5895,[ 2021,Exclusion reason: Does not focus on outcomes from a case study; ,

This household economic welfare is measured by the consumption expenditure approach. Primary data were collected from a random sample of 384 households, 211 of which are fruit value chain participants and the rest are non-participants. The endogenous switching regression model was used to control for selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity. The study finds that the more apple and mango farmers join the value chain, the higher their consumption expenditure becomes. On average, the apple and mango value chain participation increased household consumption expenditure by about 17% and 18.5%, respectively. Overall, the results indicate a positive economic welfare effect of small-scale farmer participation.

Agricultural value chain development in Nepal: Understanding mechanisms for poverty reduction,"[; '; K; a; f; l; e; ,;  ; S; o; n; g; s; r; m; w; T; W; i; t; P; ]","This analysis investigates the potential mechanisms and the practical significance of agricultural value chain development in a geographically challenging rural area of a developing country. Using data from a carefully designed primary survey administered in a hill and mountainous region in Western Nepal, we show that linking small-scale producers to regional and local traders can help increase income. Analysis of impact pathways shows that the positive impact on household income emerges through higher agricultural income, driven by higher sale volume at lower prices. Focusing on high value commodities in rural areas, where arable land is not always fully exploited or utilized, appears to lead to acreage expansion and some crop switching, contributing to higher supply albeit at lower prices. The positive impact on household income is practically significant; it helps improve household food security and asset accumulation. These findings are robust to alternative specifications. Targeted value chain interventions that strengthen and stabilize small-scale producers' access to markets can contribute to rural poverty reduction via increase in agricultural income.",2022,,AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS,53,3,356-373,,10.1111/agec.12696,,#5952,[ 2022,Exclusion reason: Does not focus on outcomes from a case study; ,

Given that food security is a crucial issue in Ethiopia, the question is whether market-oriented vegetable production will actually help farmers to become more food secure. Using a mixed methods approach, the present research gathered empirical evidence on the determinants of participation in the vegetable business and its food security impacts in the Raya Azebo district. The Heckman two-stage selection model was used to identify factors affecting participation in the vegetable business and its effects on several food security outcomes. A thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative data. The results show that a farmer's participation in the vegetable business increased significantly with adequate household productive resources (e.g., land size and access to irrigation), cooperative memberships and access to extension services. On the other hand, the age of the head of household, the market distance and risk perceptions significantly decreased participation. Additionally, the results indicate participation in the vegetable business results not only in higher food availability and access but also in lower food variety and diet diversity scores. Participation has less of an impact on per capita kilocalorie consumption and child anthropometric measures of food security. The policy implication is that, while Ethiopia is going ahead with inclusive market-driven approaches to food security, alternative mechanisms must be put in place to address the negative impacts and to empower those living in the most vulnerable conditions.",2019,,SUSTAINABILITY,11,3,-,,10.3390/su11030743,,#5953,[ 2019,Exclusion reason: Does not focus on outcomes from a case study; ,

Do Certification Schemes Enhance Coffee Yields and Household Income? Lessons Learned Across Continents,"[; '; J; e; n; a; ,;  ; P; R; G; r; o; t; U; ]","While the market for sustainably certified products grows, the debate on whether smallholder farmers benefit from this certification movement is far from over. We present empirical findings across three continents. Identical household surveys were conducted among 738 smallholder coffee farmers organized in primary cooperatives in Ethiopia, India and Nicaragua. The comparative analysis which is based on the propensity score matching approach shows that the impacts of Fairtrade certification on coffee yields and income vary across countries. In Ethiopia, the coffee farmers from Fairtrade certified cooperatives fare worse than their non-certified counterparts both in coffee yield and income. In the Indian case study, the Fairtrade cooperative members have yield and price advantages over the non-certified farmers. This has in turn led to higher net revenue from coffee for certified farmers. In Nicaragua, coffee farmers from Fairtrade and double (Fairtrade-Organic) certified cooperatives also benefit in terms of net revenue but there is no statistically significant effect on yield and household income. A comparison of the Fairtrade minimum floor price and the weight-equivalent Fairtrade cooperative price in the three countries shows that Nicaraguan Fairtrade certified farmers have obtained a higher average price than the Fairtrade mandated minimum price, whereas in Ethiopia the certified farmers received a much lower price. In India, the certified average price was closer to the minimum floor price. We conclude that coffee cooperatives and the motivation and capability of their staff play a central role in training their member farmers about each aspect of coffee growing and certification.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS,5,,-,,10.3389/fsufs.2021.716904,,#5998,[ 2022,Exclusion reason: Only compares impacts from ancillary services from the value chain amongst participants; ,

Using an endogenous switching regression model, this study finds that adopters of agricultural technologies have higher food consumption expenditure per adult. Moreover, the significant difference in food consumption expenditure per adult equivalent between the actual and counterfactual scenario is very high. The result of the study confirmed that adoption of agricultural technology has a direct and significant impact on increasing household's consumption expenditure while also reducing household poverty. The findings of the study suggest that increasing the access and adoptions of agricultural technologies significantly improves the welfare of farm households.",2023,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE & ECONOMICS,28,2,1327-1337,,10.1002/ijfe.2479,,#6001,[ 2023,Exclusion reason: Does not focus on outcomes from a case study; ,
"Can coffee certification schemes increase incomes of smallholder farmers? Evidence from Jinotega, Nicaragua","[; '; J; e; n; a; ,;  ; P; R; S; t; l; m; c; h; r; T; G; o; U; ]","This paper investigates the impact of Fairtrade and organic certification on household income of smallholder coffee farmers in the Jinotega Municipality of Nicaragua. Using a sample of 233 coffee farming households and employing endogenous switching regression model and propensity score matching method, the results found that Fairtrade and organic certification standards have different effects on the certified farmers; while Fairtrade farmers had experienced yield gains, organic farmers had the price advantage. However, the overall impact of these certification standards on the total household income is found to be statistically not significant. While some of the Fairtrade-certified cooperatives have used the social premium in creating community-level infrastructure, there is a need for more investment. The major constraint the organic-certified farmers face is lack of availability of adequate organic inputs such as manures and organic herbicides.",2017,,ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY,19,1,45-66,,10.1007/s10668-015-9732-0,,#6002,[ 2017,Exclusion reason: Does not focus on outcomes from a case study; ,
Profits and poverty: Certification's troubled link for Nicaragua's organic and fairtrade coffee producers,"[; '; B; e; u; c; h; l; t; ,;  ; T; D; Z; r; M; ]","Governments, donors and NGOs have promoted environmental and social certification schemes for coffee producers as certified market channels are assumed to offer higher prices and better incomes. Additionally, it is presumed that these certifications contribute to poverty reduction of smallholders. Yet, gross margins, profits and poverty levels of certified smallholder coffee producers have not yet been quantitatively analyzed applying random sampling techniques. Our quantitative household survey of 327 randomly selected members of conventional, organic and organic-fairtrade certified cooperatives in Nicaragua is complemented by over a hundred qualitative in-depth interviews. The results show that although farm-gate prices of certified coffees are higher than of conventional coffees, the profitability of certified coffee production and its subsequent effect on poverty levels is not clear-cut. Per capita net coffee incomes are insufficient to cover basic needs of all coffee producing households. Certified producers are more often found below the absolute poverty line than conventional producers. Over a period of ten years, our analysis shows that organic and organic-fairtrade farmers have become poorer relative to conventional producers. We conclude that coffee yield levels, profitability and efficiency need to be increased, because prices for certified coffee cannot compensate for low productivity, land or labor constraints.

We estimate the income effects of wage employment on large-scale farms in the horticultural export sector in Senegal, using data from two survey rounds covering a seven-years period of rapid expansion of the sector. We estimate average income effects as well as heterogeneous income effects, using fixed effects and quantile fixed effects regressions. We find that poverty and inequality reduced much faster in the research area than elsewhere in Senegal. Employment in the horticultural export sector is associated with higher household income and the income effect is strongest for the poorest households. Expansion of the horticultural export sector in Senegal has been particularly pro-poor through creating employment that is accessible and creates substantial income gains for the poorest half of the rural population. These pro-poor employment effects contrast with insights in the literature on increased inequality from rural wage employment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Impact pathways of voluntary sustainability standards on smallholder coffee producers in Honduras: Price premiums, farm productivity, production costs, access to credit","[; '; E; s; t; r; e; l; a; ,;  ; A; N; v; i; c; h; o; D; K; n; B; z; T; ]","Coffee production in Honduras is under constant economic pressure, social unrest, and climate challenges. This largely affects the living conditions of thousands of smallholder coffee producers as the weakest actors in the coffee value chain and exacerbates the level of poverty and inequality that they face. A considerable part of the coffee production in Honduras is under different Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS); a major goal of these standards is to improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. Thus, this paper assesses the economic impact of Fairtrade, UTZ, and 4C on smallholder producers against a control group, using Propensity Score Matching with data of the coffee year 2015/2016. The main economic variables studied in this paper are gross profit, household income, and poverty likelihood. In addition, this study develops a conceptual framework to explore different impact pathways -price premium, farm productivity, production costs, and access to credit- that could improve farm performance and ultimately the economic conditions of farmers. The results of this study suggest that smallholder coffee producers in Honduras are not obtaining a higher economic impact from the different cer-tifications assessed. Among the pathways, only the price premium was statistically significant for the three certifications assessed, displaying higher prices per unit than the control group. In line with their economic conditions, these producers have a probability between 56% and 58% of living under the national poverty line according to the Poverty Probability Index (PPI), concluding that certifications do not always improve the livelihood of coffee producers.",2022,,WORLD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES,27,,-,,10.1016/j.wdp.2022.100435,,#6015,[ 2022,Exclusion reason: Only compares impacts from ancillary services from the value chain amongst participants; ,

This paper explores the impact of value chain participation on food insecurity among smallholder farmers in Swayimane KwaZulu-Natal. Purposive sampling technique was used to sample 51 smallholder vegetable farmers who were value chain participants at various levels. The study uses the Household Food Insecurity Access scale (HFIAS) and the Instrumental Variable Poisson model to assess the household food security status and the factors that influence the food security status among the smallholder farmers. The results show that 66.7% of the farmers in the sample were food secure, 17.65% were mildly food insecure, 7.84% were moderately food insecure and 7.84% were severely food insecure. Value chain participation, age of the household head, marital status, formal education, farm income, lease rent on land, access to NGOs, access to agricultural agency, access to credit, access to television, access to extension services and access to an irrigation scheme were significant in impacting household food insecurity. The study concluded that participation in value chains was significant in reducing food insecurity among smallholder farmers in Swayimane and therefore, strategies focusing on enhancing value chain participation among farmers should be adopted along with interventions that enhance value chain participation among smallholder farmers. As empirically posited by the results of this study, the more households are involved in the vegetable value chain, the better the household food intake and food security they become.

Strengthening collective action to improve marketing performance: evidence from farmer groups in Central Africa,"[; '; O; c; h; i; e; n; g; ,;  ; J; K; r; B; w; u; o; G; m; a; E; ]","Purpose: Several development organisations have implemented programs to enhance smallholder farmers' crop productivity and market access through collective action with mixed results. Therefore, this study examines the drivers of success of collective action initiatives as a pathway to improving farmers marketing performance using data from Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.Design/methodology/approach: This study uses primary data collected from 30 farmer groups through focus group discussions. These groups are assessed for differences in their marketing performance using descriptive and cluster analysis techniques.Findings: Most of the group members are poor (67%) and few are considered as rich (2%) or middle class (28%), while the rest are destitute. The destitute community members are often excluded from the groups due to their own passivity and inability to contribute financial resources for joint activities. Mature farmer groups with strong internal structures and greater participation in product bulking as well as formally organised groups with stable external links significantly have higher marketing performance.Practical implications: We recommend that for farmers to maximise the benefits of collective action, supportive policies are necessary to encourage the formation of groups and transform existing ones into business entities to access high-value markets and perhaps even export markets. Farmer groups need to intensify their market research to access ready and stable markets such as supermarkets and institutions with larger volumetric requirements.Theoretical implications: The study shows that collective action is important for smallholder farmers in developing countries to sustainably access markets and increase their marketing performance.Originality/Value: Few studies have examined how social capital and collective action are utilised to improve smallholder farmers marketing performance, particularly in Central Africa.",2018,,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION & EXTENSION,24,2,169-189,,10.1080/1389224X.2018.1432493,,#6023,[ 2018,Exclusion reason: Does not focus on outcomes from a case study; ,

Group members had an extra four days of access to water in a month, and applied at least 130 kg/ha more inorganic fertiliser, than non-group members. Group members had a higher household income per capita and more assets than nongroup members. However, the result revealed a heterogeneous effect among group members, with the benefits varying according to members' socio-economic characteristics as well as internal group dynamics. The government and private donors should continue to promote the formation and organisation of farmers into groups. The role of group membership in farming outcomes can be enhanced if smaller groups are promoted.

Value chain approaches to development: Smallholder farmer perceptions of risk and benefits across three cocoa chains in Ghana,"[; '; R; i; c; k; e; t; s; ,;  ; K; a; D; T; u; r; v; y; C; l; m; G; ó; z; M; g; I; ]","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to look at the ever-popular, ""value-chain approach"" for linking smallholder farmers to high value export markets. Conventional wisdom says that value chains undertaken for development purposes redistribute risk and provide benefits and services to participants that are otherwise difficult or impossible to obtain. The authors take a farmer-centric approach and ask farmers participating in these higher value chains if they perceive greater, or different risks and compare results to their conventional counterparts. The authors also ask what benefits they associate with participation and if they believe they believe those benefits are exclusive to value chain participation. Design/methodology/approach - The authors collect data from growers in three different cocoa value chains in Ashanti, Ghana. These chains include one focussed on certified production practices (Rainforest Alliance), one that focussed on high-value product characteristics (Fine Flavor) and a conventional chain, which serves as counterfactual. Findings - The paper finds differences in perceptions of participation risks and benefits - particularly among price risks - that appear to filter based on value chain membership. However, for many risks, value chain participation seems to do little to redistribute potential production shocks. With some exceptions, growers report that many of the benefits they enjoy as a result of participation could feasibly be accessed by other sources. Research limitations/implications - The limitations of this paper are related to sample size. This was managed from a statistical perspective. Social implications - The authors explore how these results might impact the sustainability of the value chain approach and encourage donors and development agencies to be thoughtful and critical about measuring how farmers perceive new market opportunities. Originality/value - The authors believe that this is the first paper prepared to critically investigate the perceived benefits of value chains.",2014,,Journal of Agribusiness in Developing and Emerging Economies,4,1,Feb-22,,,,#6048,[ 2014,Exclusion reason: Insufficient information on value and/or inclusion outcomes; ,
Can commercial farming promote rural dynamism in sub-Saharan Africa? Evidence from Mozambique,"[; '; G; l; o; v; e; r; ,;  ; S; t; n; J; s; a; m; ]","The impact of commercial farms on smallholders in developing countries remains highly controversial. This study draws on four periods of investments in commercial farming in Mozambique to frame an empirical analysis of their contemporary economic spillovers. We investigate the degree of selection of commercial farms into more favourable locations as well as the extent of heterogeneity in the effects of different commercial farming models on proximate smallholders. The analysis uses survey data covering all large commercial farms in Mozambique and which are linked to a nationally-representative survey of 6000 smallholders. Contrary to widespread assumptions that investors target only marginal farm land, we find that commercial farms are highly selective in their locations, preferring areas close to existing infrastructure and markets. Controlling for selection bias via reweighting and fixed effects, we find the presence of a commercial farm is associated with moderately higher incomes among neighbouring smallholders but a lower incidence of wage employment. Furthermore, these effects vary according to the type of commercial farming in place. More inclusive commercial models, such as those associated with outgrower schemes, appear to generate larger benefits. We conclude that broad generalizations about commercial farming investments must be replaced by more nuanced discussions of alternative investment models.",2019,,World Development,114,,110-,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.09.029,,#6050,[ 2019,Exclusion reason: Insufficient information on value and/or inclusion outcomes; ,
Can private food standards promote gender equality in the small farm sector?,"[; '; M; e; m; k; n; ,;  ; E; Q; a; i; ]","Agricultural commercialization can help to lift subsistence farmers out of poverty, but can also have adverse effects on gender equality. We explore whether private food standards - with their particular elements to regulate production and trade-could serve as a vehicle to promote gender equality in the small farm sector. We use gender-disaggregated data from coffee producers in Uganda and focus on two sustainability standards that explicitly address gender issues, namely Fairtrade and UTZ. Entropy balancing techniques, combined with estimates of farmers' willingness to accept standards, are used to control for possible selection bias when comparing certified and non-certified households. We find that standards and their certification programs increase wealth in male-headed and female-headed households. In male-headed households, standards also change the intra-household distribution of asset ownership: while in non-certified households, assets are predominantly owned by the male household head alone, in certified households most assets are jointly owned by the male head and his female spouse. Standards also improve access to agricultural extension for both male and female farmers. Effects on women's access to financial services are statistically insignificant. Private standards cannot completely eliminate gender disparities, but the findings suggest that they can contribute towards this goal.",2018,,JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES,58,,39-51,,10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.12.030,,#6055,[ 2018,Exclusion reason: Only compares impacts from ancillary services from the value chain amongst participants; ,

We use primary data collected in Asia (Bangladesh, Philippines) and Africa (Benin, Malawi) to examine the relationships between women's empowerment, gender equality, and participation in a variety of local agricultural value chains that comprise the food system. We find that the value chain and the specific node of engagement matter, as do other individual and household characteristics, but in different ways depending on country context. Entrepreneurship-often engaged in by wealthier households with greater ability to take risks-is not necessarily empowering for women; nor is household wealth, as proxied by their asset ownership. Increased involvement in the market is not necessarily correlated with greater gender equality. Education is positively correlated with higher empowerment of both men and women, but the strength of this association varies. Training and extension services are generally positively associated with empowerment but could also exacerbate the inequality in empowerment between men and women in the same household. All in all, culture and context determine whether participation in value chains-and which node of the value chain-is empowering. In designing food systems interventions, care should be taken to consider the social and cultural contexts in which these food systems operate, so that interventions do not exacerbate existing gender inequalities.",2021,,FOOD SECURITY,13,5,1101-1124,,10.1007/s12571-021-01193-5,,#6057,[ 2021,Exclusion reason: Does not focus on outcomes from a case study; ,

Therefore, this study objects to evaluate preferences for contract attributes and attribute levels among contracting buyers, farmers, and government officials through data triangulation from key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and participant observations. Based on Henry Garrett Ranking, Rank Based Quotient, and Rank Based Sum methods, results indicate that the most important attributes were price options, payment, delivery arrangement, input provision, input-use requirements, and product quality standards. Despite a consensus on the ranking of the contract attributes, the preferences for the attribute levels among the stakeholders were heterogeneous. It is recommended that attributes and their levels should be pertinent in contract agreements. Thus, contract design with an adjusted or premium price, 50% of estimated payment before harvesting and the rest after delivery three to five days or lump-sum immediate payment, delivery after harvesting, inputs provision by the contractors through the representative branches or stores located at the local areas or cooperatives, banning active-ingredients or flexible use of inputs from the contractors to produce Good Agricultural Practices or organic products are considerable options.",2022,,SUSTAINABILITY,14,6,-,,10.3390/su14063478,,#6069,[ 2022,Exclusion reason: Does not focus on outcomes from a case study; ,

Access to output markets is a key factor in generating higher incomes. The rise of modern markets (supermarkets in particular) is generally viewed as positive for the rural poor, although most commentators accede that there are challenges to be overcome in obtaining access to such markets. These challenges are generally perceived as supply-side issues: That is, the ""fault"" for market exclusion lies largely with small producers their production methods, their business organisation and their location - rather than with these markets themselves. This study asserts that much of the research that has been undertaken in this area is in fact incomplete, because it has excluded two key issues: The likely impact of the dominant supermarket business model on small farmers; and the actual position of small farmers in those countries with high levels of supermarket concentration. A closer examination of the supermarket model suggests it is inherently hostile towards smaller producers. The South African food retail market structure resembles that of industrialised countries rather than developing countries. Therefore, we should expect that the position of South African small farmers vis-a-vis supermarkets is similar to that of small farmers in industrialised countries, who are increasingly excluded from these value chains.",2013,,AGREKON,52,1,68-86,,10.1080/03031853.2013.778466,,#6080,[ 2013,Exclusion reason: Does not focus on outcomes from a case study; ,

This paper focuses on domestic value chains and disruptive innovations at different nodes in value chain framework in its interaction with innovation systems. Also, it presents endogeneity corrected evidence on the impacts of supermarket procurement in a semi-arid region of the country. This paper presented evidence on impacts of supermarket procurement in a semi-arid region from a study of 254 vegetable growers that sell to both supermarkets and traditional markets. Analysing the data using different methods to control selection bias showed that there has been a significant and positive impact of participating in supermarket procurement on net income. Further, the entry into these new markets is not conditioned by land ownership, but rather by possession of irrigation. Forces of globalisation, changing demand pattern with rising incomes and urbanisation, rapid strides in information and communication technologies, and transformative roles for institutional actors in state, private sector and civil society have been altering the landscape of agricultural production and marketing in the last few years. Also, there are now increased interactions between retailers, wholesalers, processors, logistics, cold storages, farmers and consumers. Further, the entry into these new markets is not conditioned by land ownership, but rather by possession of irrigation. Therefore, policy makers may consider improving conditions for entry of resource poor farmers into these modern markets, which might become much more dominant in the years to come as happened elsewhere in other developing countries.",2017,,Indian Journal of Agricultural Economics,72,1,24-48,,,,#6088,[ 2017,Exclusion reason: Does not focus on outcomes from a case study; ,

As a result, several African countries have tended to focus on non-traditional agricultural exports (NTEs) which reflect their comparative advantage and for many countries the export of horticultural crops has been favoured. This study focuses on a household survey undertaken in the forest and coastal savannah transition zones of Ghana, where the farming system has undergone a remarkable transition from an established system of food crop farming for sale to urban consumers to an intensive production of fruits and vegetable crops for export to European consumers. Econometric analysis shows that though export horticulture has a positive impact on the wellbeing of the majority of households, the chronically poor households are structurally impeded from seizing the available opportunities due to poor resource endowment and liquidity constraints.",2007,,AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,2,9,435-440,,,,#6117,[ 2007,Exclusion reason: Does not focus on outcomes from a case study; ,
Smallholder participation and certification of organic farm products in Mexico,"[; '; G; o; n; z; a; l; e; ,;  ; A; N; i; g; h; R; ]","Organic and other environmental and social marketing devices seek to connect producers and consumers more directly and reward environmentally and socially superior production systems. Some researchers have observed that these schemes may introduce mechanisms of exclusion, creating an elite group of certified smallholders while putting non-certified farmers at a distinct disadvantage and introducing division among people whose true interest may lie more in relations of solidarity and cooperation The trade and regulatory environment that smallholder coops must navigate is increasingly complex and adaptation to its requirements has important implications for farmer organizations Standards applied to certify smallholder production systems tend to be developed with regard to first-world consumer interests and imposed in a top-down fashion by certification agencies and intermediaries, with little or no farmer participation. Especially in the tropics, agricultural standards that reflect temperate country conditions may place unnecessary burdens on growers who attempt to meet agronomic norms that are irrelevant to local agroecologies. After providing a summary of organic farming and certification in Mexico over the past two decades, we discuss three emerging trends the advent of contract agriculture in organic production, the appearance of a new, environmentally-based coffee certification system intended to favor bird conservation, and a recent government program to support transition to organic production. All three trends involve certain contradictions, both with the foundational social and ecological goals of organic agriculture and with the interests of small farmers. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This article reports on smallholders' willingness to join afforestation programs, growing Acacia mangium under contract on their private farmland. In a Choice Experiment, we examine the effects of policy attributes of afforestation contracts, including contract duration, labour participation, timber insurance, training opportunities, road improvement, and expected income. We report the marginal value of changes in monetary terms. A scale-extended latent class model was used to analyse preference heterogeneity in data of 323 smallholders from three different regions in Indonesia (West Kalimantan, Yogyakarta, and South Sumatera). These regions are at different forest transition stages. Our results indicate that there are four latent preference classes, which value attributes of the contract differently. Individual characteristics (risk orientation, tree growing experiences, and occupation), and regional differences explain the probability of preference class membership. Our findings have important implications for enhancing afforestation strategies that improve social welfare of smallholders in various forest transition stages.",2017,,LAND USE POLICY,65,,211-223,,10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.04.015,,#6136,[ 2017,Exclusion reason: Does not focus on outcomes from a case study; ,
Role of cooperative companies in sustainable rice production and poverty alleviation in Guilan state of Iran,"[; '; M; o; t; a; m; e; d; ,;  ; K; ]","This study was conducted in the districts of Guilan state of Iran to assess the impact of cooperative companies on the economic condition of rice farmers in the Guilan state. The research was conducted in the 2005 to 2007 periods. Three hundred respondents were selected for the study comprising equal number of participants and non-participants of producer cooperatives. Data were collected using survey questionnaire with a reliability test of 88% using Kronback Alfa Coefficient. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results showed that there were significant differences between members and non-members with respect to the production rate of paddy, income gained through sale of rice, level of participation, reduction of unemployment, increment of annual income and technical knowledge. Also, there was a positive correlation between the rate of paddy production per hectare with income resulting from the sale thereof, the income resulting from each hectare of the rice field with the annual income of the farmer, annual income of the farmer and rate of paddy produced and on participation in training courses and the production rate of paddy. According to above points, cooperative companies have a basic role in achievement sustainable rice production and reduction of poverty in Guilan state of Iran, thus cooperative companies should be organized and supported by government.",2010,,AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY,9,11,1592-1599,,,,#6120,[ 2010,Exclusion reason: Insufficient information on value and/or inclusion outcomes; ,
Does contract farming improve rice yield In Ghana?,"['Mabe, FN', 'Danso-Abbeam, G', 'Sienso, G']","Contract farming has gained grounds in Ghana's rice production sub-sector but there is no conclusive evidence on whether or not the model improves rice yield. This study sought to identify factors influencing farmers' decision to participate in contract farming. Also, it estimated the effects of contract farming on rice yield. The study used a cross-sectional data. Heckman sample selection model was used to estimate the effects of contract farming on rice yield. The study showed that education, irrigation, extension contact and improved seed positively influenced contract farming engagement. Farming experience and farm size had negative relationship with contract farming engagement. Whilst fertilizer, capital, irrigation, improved seed and contract farming engagement highly increased rice yield, seed, labour and household size negatively affected yield. Conclusively, contract farming improves rice yield. It is recommended that farmers should be encouraged to go into contract farming. Extension service intensification and education are critical in this regard. The efforts of government in providing subsidized fertilizer and improved seeds to farmers through planting for food and jobs programme should be enhanced through contractual arrangement and the use of nucleus-farmer-out-grower model. The one-village-one-dam policy of government should include the establishment of irrigation facilities.",2019,,COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE,5,1,,,10.1080/23311932.2019.1643518,,#5823,[ 2019,Exclusion reason: Retracted article,
