N2  - Sustainability certification has become an important tool for promoting sustainable agricultural value chains. Nevertheless, its economic and environmental effects on the producer level remain unclear. We investigate the relationship of Rainforest Alliance Certification with socio-economic and environmental outcomes in Rwanda and consider potential tradeoffs between dimensions. To reduce potential selection bias in the econometric estimation, we use inverse probability weighted regression adjustment. We find no significant association between certification and socio-economic indicators but a significant correlation between certification and good agricultural practices and biodiversity-related practices. Effects on economic outcomes and biodiversity-related practices are linked; their relationship differs across climatic regions.

N2  - Access to cheap labour affects Ghanaian smallholder farmers significantly. Such access can be enhanced through mutual labour support. However, it has become necessary to explore how this form of collective action affects farmers' productivity and efficiency. In this study, the impact of access to mutual labour support on productivity and technical efficiency was estimated using data collected from 592 smallholder maize farmers in Northern Ghana. The study uses a translog stochastic production frontier model, while accounting for sample selection bias that may emanate from both observable and unobservable household characteristics. Farmers with access to mutual labour support are significantly more productive and technically efficient than those without, with mean technical efficiency in the range of 0.62-0.71 for farmers with access to mutual labour support and 0.55-0.60 for those without access. Sex, education, spraying machine ownership, farm size, extension visits, access to credit, and membership of farmer-based organisation are significant determinants of access to mutual labour support. Policies to help farmer groups and extension agents promote mutual labour support accessibility among farmers are recommended.

N2  - Financial exclusion continues to be a major challenge to smallholder farmers' participation in agricultural value chains in developing countries. Digitizing procurements and other forms of transactions using mobile money technology among value chain actors is essential for ensuring financial inclusion and enhancing agricultural value chain transformation. This study examines the factors influencing the adoption of mobile money technology and the impact of the technology on production input use and farm output, utilizing data from a cross-sectional survey of smallholder rice farmers in northern Ghana. A linear regression with endogenous treatment effects method is employed to account for both observable and unobservable selection bias. The results reveal positive and significant marginal effect of mobile money technology on input use and farm output. Adopters of the technology applied 18% and 13% more fertilizer and herbicides, respectively than nonadopters. The output increased by about 4% for the adopters. The results also show that mobile money technology adoption, input use and farm output are significantly influenced by education, farmer-based organization (FBO) membership, access to credit, input prices, and location fixed effects. Expansion of mobile technology networks, increased investment in education, credit facilities, and FBOs can be quite relevant in promoting the adoption of mobile money technology in Ghana.

N2  - Many studies show that participation in contract farming has positive impacts on farm productivity and incomes. Most of the literature, however, does not take into account that contracts vary in their specifications, making empirical evidence scarce on the diverse impacts of different types of contracts. In this study, we investigate the driving forces of participation in marketing and production contracts, relative to spot markets. We also study the extent to which different contract types add additional benefits to smallholder farmers, using recent survey data of 389 cashew farmers in Ghana. To account for selection bias arising from observed and unobserved factors, we apply a multinomial endogenous switching regression method and implement a counterfactual analysis. The empirical results demonstrate that farmers who participate in production contracts obtain significantly higher cashew yields, cashew net revenues, and are more food secure compared to spot market farmers. We also find substantial heterogeneity in the impact of marketing and production contracts across scale of operation. Small sized farms that participate in production contracts tend to benefit the most. Marketing contracts, however, do not appear to benefit cashew farmers.

N2  - Chinese agriculture is experiencing a transition from smallholder farming to the emergence of commercial farms that are characterized by intensification and specialization in production, as well as commercialization and cooperation in management. It requires substantial capital to facilitate such a transition, but it is very difficult for farmers in China to access bank credit. One way that commercial farms have to overcome such handicap is by organizing themselves into cooperatives. To assess the effect of cooperatives on the credit accessibility of commercial farms, we have developed a theoretical model as well as an empirical study of commercial farms in Jiangsu Province based on data from a survey of 754 commercial farm owners. Instrumental variable (IV) methods and the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method that control endogeneity problem are used in the analysis. The empirical results show that cooperatives have a significant positive impact on the credit access of commercial farms. Commercial farms participating in cooperatives may alleviated their credit constraints by about 17.3 percentage points and increase the average credit per capita by nearly 80,000 Yuan. Cooperatives improve the credit access of commercial farms by exerting strong market power and reputation effect based on its organizational advantages. A disaggregated analysis also reveals that small commercial farms tend to benefit more from cooperatives in improving credit access than large commercial farms.

N2  - We witness a promotion of hybrid partnerships, where actors with different competences and resources collaborate for smallholder inclusive value chain development. To better understand the functioning of these partnerships, we used institutional theory and studied the context of a global and emerging regional food value chains in Ghana, the blending of logics by key actors in Innovation Platforms and Public Private Partnerships, and their effect on value chain relations of smallholder farmers. In the global value chain of cocoa, partnerships adhered to 'green revolution' and 'free-market' logics, and provided all farmers material support. In the more informally organised regional food sector, local executing partners selectively coupled their logics with those of poor smallholders, who rely on low-input agriculture and solidarity logics to make ends meet. This improved the position and transaction costs of smallholders to participate in the value chain. Hence, it is more likely for partnerships to create smallholder inclusive governance in informally organised regional food value chains, than highly structured global value chains controlled by international buyers. To gain insight in the variety of political effects this triggers in different social-historical shaped farmer communities, households and actors, we recommend complementary local research from a critical institutional perspective.

N2  - What are supply chain management challenges in a lower-income economy, and how do managers at smaller firms address them? This field study presents these challenges from the perspective of the 60 managers who run firms selling irrigation equipment in Senegal. By canvasing 35 cities, we gain unique visibility into how private supply chains, on which public officials and smallholder farmers in Africa rely, effectively deliver agricultural goods. The primary challenges for managers in this supply chain are day-to-day risks that are quality and contractual in nature and have financial implications. City size in combination with supplier type, firm size, and manager network determine risk exposure. Firms' efforts to manage the chain are more reactive than proactive and more informal than formal, which reveals an opportunity for public agencies to support supplier and customer coordination. Public decision makers should tailor support to account for the differential risks that city size brings to supply chain management. This support should include not just financing the firms directly but should also entail giving loans to customers, certifying suppliers, and sharing inventory risk with public and nonprofit partners.

N2  - This article explores how sugarcane commercialization impacts gender relations, and processes that shape them, using two differently structured outgrower schemes--a settlement scheme and an European Union-driven block farm in southern Zambia. Results show gendered impacts across the schemes are complex and are shaped by diverse cultural arrangements as micro-processes. Intrahousehold patterns of decision making, land, and labor dynamics reveal that changing the structure, organization, and integration of outgrower schemes does not necessarily make them responsive to strategic gender needs. Further, these processes are insufficient in altering pre-existing sociocultural imbalances. Consequently, even where schemes are intentional about being inclusive, they are likely to replicate structural inequalities and fail to engender transformational changes among participants. This article raises the need to address the politics of land and labor relations, and their implications for different social groups within their cultural-historical context.

N2  - We used two-wave panel data obtained from avocado growers in Murang'a County in Kenya to examine, through the perspective of gender, the dynamics of farmers' participation in avocado production and marketing organizations (PMOs), and test whether understanding group dynamics is important for analyzing contract farming. Using a multinomial logit (MNL) model, we identify the characteristics of men and women participating in PMOs categorized as early adopters, dis-adopters, late adopters, and non-adopters. We focus on dis-adopters and late adopters because these categories are most often ignored in the literature. Moreover, without considering the dynamics, we verify the influencing factors of PMOs by estimating a random-effects logit model that controls for unobserved heterogeneity across households. Furthermore, we estimate a sequential-choice model to test whether the process of selection into group membership affects the process of selection into contracting. Our results reveal heterogeneity with regard to household, farm, and resource characteristics across categories of farmers and between gender groups. Besides, the results reveal that group and contracting dynamics are related, and ignoring the former leads to biased estimates of the determinants of contracting dynamics. Policy efforts should focus on supporting women farmers to enhance their participation in PMOs, which ultimately affects contracting. Improving access to high-yielding avocado varieties and building capacity in orchard management would enhance women's decision-making including group participation, contracting, and marketing. Low-cost agricultural credit may also improve women's ownership of improved avocado trees and hence their participation in high-value markets.

N2  - Inclusive value chain frameworks have been widely adopted by states and international development agencies as a strategy for addressing rural poverty. The approach aims to improve smallholder farmers' linkages to agricultural markets and to increase the value of their products within these markets. Inclusive value chain initiatives targeting apple producers in northwestern Nepal are illustrative of this development approach. This article examines apple production in Jumla District, which has expanded rapidly over the last two decades, and shows how value chain development interventions have sought to accelerate a shift towards commercial agriculture by linking producers to agribusiness partners and upgrading production. A central assumption of these interventions is that farmers will aim to maximize profits through entrepreneurial strategies within targeted value chains. However, as this article demonstrates, a closer investigation of the political ecology of apple production in the region calls this assumption into question. The article argues that the popularity of apples in Jumla District must be situated within processes of agrarian change and livelihood diversification that have informed labour-saving, risk-averse approaches to apple market participation. The findings lend support to calls for strategies that prioritize autonomy and long-term risk mitigation over competitive market integration.

N2  - The yield-increasing effects of agricultural cooperative membership have been widely examined in the literature. However, so far, little is known about whether cooperative membership has the potential to reduce farmers' exposure to production risk. We address this gap by estimating the impacts of cooperative membership on expected yield, yield variance (variability), and yield skewness (exposure to downside risk), using data collected from a survey of 626 banana farmers in China. We employ an endogenous switching regression model to address the selectivity bias issue. The empirical results show that cooperative membership increases banana yield by 3% and reduces the variance and downside risk exposure by 60% and 114%, respectively. The results are supported by robustness check estimates, using propensity score matching and inverse probability weighted regression adjustment models. Additional analysis reveals that the treatment effects of cooperative membership vary among members with different household and farm characteristics. Our findings suggest that agricultural cooperatives can be an effective institutional arrangement for reducing production risk and crop failure and point to the need for policies and programmes in developing cooperatives and increasing membership involvements of smallholder farmers.

N2  - Over the last 15 years, the agricultural economics and development literature has amply highlighted success stories of smallholder farmers in developing countries, illustrating their increased engagement and integration with markets, in other words, higher rates of commercialisation. Yet, this seeming 'success' should not detract from the large proportion of farmers who, through engaging in high-value market chains, face high risks that often limit the extent of their engagement. This study, across four African contexts in Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, strives to better understand smallholder participation in agricultural commercialisation. Using new detailed cross-sectional household-level data, from the Agricultural Policy Research in Africa (APRA) consortium, collected over 2017-2018, we analyse assets as a determining factor for localised patterns smallholder commercialisation. Applying asset-based thresholds, we capture commercialisation 'capacity'--an indicator of the household's commercialisation potential and ability to respond to risks. Despite the possibility to increase commercialisation as well as institutional arrangements that may reduce risk, such as contract farming, benefits from linkages with medium-scale farmers or returns from specific crop types, we find that households may yet be constrained by lower capacity. Hence, the need for targeted support for those at the margins and with limited assets; with the most pronounced and significant constraints for lower capacity households in study areas in Tanzania. These results can better inform development policies for agriculture where it is important to be able to specifically target households rather than a one size fits all approach.

N2  - Cumin is a flowering plant and the second Ethiopian export spice crop next to ginger. The area coverage, as well as the production of white cumin, is increasing year to year. However, there is a growing gap between white cumin demand and supply in Ethiopia due to its low production and productivity of white cumin. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate factors affecting the technical inefficiency of white cumin production among smallholder producers in Northwestern Ethiopia. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect the primary data from 228 white cumin producers, who were selected by using a systematic random sampling technique. Moreover, a combination of data analysis methods such as descriptive statistics and the stochastic Cobb-Douglas production frontier model was used to analyze the collected data. The empirical result of the study showed that the mean technical efficiency of white cumin production was 81%. This implies that white cumin producers can boost white cumin output by 19% using the existing level of inputs and technology. The maximum likelihood estimates of the stochastic production model revealed that land, Nitrogen-Phosphate and Sulphate, and urea were statistically and positively affected the production level of white cumin. The positive effect indicates that the lack of these inputs would hamper the production of white cumin. Moreover, the maximum likelihood estimate of the stochastic frontier model coupled with the inefficiency parameters indicated that the age of household head, tropical livestock unit, land fragmentation, and membership of cooperatives were found to be statistically and negatively influence the level of technical inefficiency of white cumin producers, whereas family size, distance to the main road and credit access were found to be statistically and positively influence the level of technical inefficiency of white cumin producers. Hence, the study suggested that the government should strengthen farm cooperatives and construct roads near the residence of producers to improve their efficiency level. Moreover, the district experts should arrange an experience-sharing (which is a proxy variable for age) program to improve the efficiency level of less efficient producers by adopting the best practice of relatively efficient producers.

N2  - Given the structure and functioning of agricultural markets and the policies and institutional space, smallholder farmers in India often face the risks of strategic failures, which force them to either opt for distress selling, operate as fringe retailers or participate in the existing supply or value chains on given conditions. In this perspective, this paper examines if smallholder farmers' collectives can potentially strengthen their market position vis-a-vis other individual players and enable them to explore strategic options in a greater way. On the basis of the structure-conduct-performance theory and field experiences from two selected villages of West Bengal (India), the paper finds that the collectivization of smallholder farmers helps in exploring a larger set of strategic options for better outcomes. Further, the choice of the strategy set varies across the collectives depending on their composition, functioning, and resource endowments. Nevertheless, there is a possibility of strategic failures because of intra- as well as intercollective conflicts and competition from other players. The success in this regard would, therefore, depend on how the collectives democratically resolve such conflicts and develop capacity and capabilities to enhance their competitiveness for greater strategic success. Besides, addressing market imperfections through policy and institutional interventions would also be crucial.

N2  - Dairying has played a significant role in providing a livelihood to farmers in India. About 80 million rural Indian households are engaged in milk production with a very high proportion being landless, small and marginal farmers. The study aims to analyse the challenges faced by the dairy industry in generating employment and expanding their business. The paper has taken data from annual survey of industries over 20 years and a case study with a detailed interview of a cooperative society working in the dairy sector. The analysis is based on autoregressive distributed lag model. With the help of analysis, the study found that the dairy industry has the potential to generate employment. During the interaction for the case study, it was observed that firms in the dairy industry undertake the production of value-added products to yield profits which is limited due to low investments. However, the lack of advertisements of these products results in restrained sales and limits income of the farmers. Therefore, the study suggests that the private sector should be encouraged through product link incentive scheme and the government should intervene as a facilitator for their growth and expansion on international levels.

N2  - In this study, we explore the nature of the relationship between smallholder growers and local traders in the coffee value chain in Eastern Uganda. Analysing the results of two lab-in-the-field experiments (trust and dictator games), we highlight the complex relationship between these two value chain actors. We develop three competing hypotheses: (1) coffee growers will send more to fellow growers than local traders due to social identity and fairness motives as well as because of past opportunistic behaviour of traders (2) coffee growers will send more to traders to curry favour, and (3) growers will send growers and traders the same amount because in a relatively competitive market setting there is little room for opportunistic trader behaviour. We fail to reject our third hypothesis. Our results highlight the importance of fully understanding value chain actor relationships and contexts to better design interventions to improve rural markets.

N2  - Addressing public health externalities often requires community-level collective action. Due to social norms, each person's sanitation investment decisions may depend on the decisions of neighbors. We report on a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted with 19,000 households in rural Bangladesh where we grouped neighboring households and introduced (either financial or social recognition) rewards with a joint liability component for the group, or asked each group member to make a private or public pledge to maintain a hygienic latrine. The group financial reward has the strongest impact in the short term (3 months), inducing a 7.5-12.5 percentage point increase in hygienic latrine ownership, but this effect dissipates in the medium term (15 months). In contrast, the public commitment induced a 4.2-6.3 percentage point increase in hygienic latrine ownership in the short term, but this effect persists in the medium term. Non-financial social recognition or a private pledge has no detectable effect on sanitation investments.

N2  - The South African Government's drive to empower smallholder farmers through preferentially facilitated access to procurement opportunities should be concomitantly matched with the smallholder capacity to deliver. However, there has been little information from the literature to examine the smallholder farmers' predisposition toward aggregation or whether they would prefer to remain independent from any form of organization to enhance their capacity. The study was undertaken, based on a simple random selection of the smallholder farmers in the district of Thabo Mofutsanyane. The results indicate that despite the perceived benefits of belonging to a group, about half of the smallholder farmers would prefer to remain independent from any form of aggregation or farmer group. The results are an antithesis to the common literature opinion on farmer grouping or aggregation. On the other hand, it may be that smallholder farmers would subscribe to coming together for collective benefit, but currently, do not have a formal governance structure or group account. The results provide an alert that while the government considers group operations such as cooperatives as a potential mechanism to deepen empowerment, it remains a challenge to properly entrench such notion for collective group operations beyond the means of the smallholder farmers to access resources.

N2  - This study provides empirical evidence for the relation between perishability in vertically coordinated supply chains and the market power exercised over smallholders in Nepal. Using survey data from small-scale farms of tomatoes, ginger, high-yielding variety paddy seeds, and lentils, we demonstrate how varying levels of perishability affect the degree of market power exercised by contractors and in cooperative farming. We show how much value-added is diverted from farmers, compared to the benchmark set by the least perishable good. Results indicate that more perishable crops are subject to a greater degree of market power. A subsequent scenario analysis reveals that the redistributive effects of market power based on crop perishability are substantial: smallholders' farm profitability increase by 18% as crop perishability is reduced by 50%. We conclude by discussing policy measures to reduce power imbalances due to crop perishability.

N2  - Contract farming gained importance in many developing countries. While effects of contracting on smallholder farmers' incomes were analyzed in previous studies, diet and nutrition effects are not yet well understood. Here, we examine the effects of contract farming on dietary diversity and child anthropometrics, using survey data from the palm oil sector in Ghana. Contracting improves smallholder nutrition, but the effects vary by contract type. We distinguish between marketing contracts and resource-providing contracts that affect household labor use and gender roles differently. For both contract types, contracting female farmers has larger positive child nutrition effects than contracting male farmers.

N2  - This study evaluates the impact of adopting improved sesame varieties on farm household food security using the data collected in 2018 from potential sesame-growing districts in northwestern Ethiopia. Selectivity and endogeneity problems were addressed by endogenous switching regression and the propensity score matching approach. Thus, we estimated the influence of technology adoption on different food security indicators. Our findings indicate that the adoption of new sesame varieties significantly reduced the propensity of food insecurity through increased food consumption expenditures, improved nutritional food intake (consumption scores), and the probability of food security of a household. The finding supports that there is a positive relationship between cash crops and food security. Access to improved sesame seeds, a cash liquidity advantage, extension service efficiency, and farmers' networking have a significant and positive effect on the adoption of improved sesame varieties. Hence, development policies should be established to motivate cash crop seed multipliers and research institutes to satisfy the seed demand, improve extension service efficiency, and support rural farmers' primary cooperative. The study enriches the current debate on the subject and provides new empirical evidence of the synergy between cash crops and food security.

N2  - This paper aims to analyze the impacts of a backup agreement contract on the performance of a small agricultural producers' citrus supply chain. A backup agreement contract, which ensures for each echelon that a quantity of products will be bought independently of real demand, is proposed to coordinate a three-echelon supply chain, aimed at improving income. After presenting an overview of the literature that shows various coordination mechanisms but no backup agreement proposals for supply chain coordination, this paper develops a decentralized three-echelon supply chain facing stochastic customer demand and includes the backup agreement as a coordination mechanism to guarantee a balanced relationship between the chain members. The model is tested in a real case study in Colombia, and a sensitivity analysis is provided. Results show that a backup agreement contract coordinates the small agricultural producers' supply chain and improves income for each echelon, especially for the small producer. However, the economic mechanism complexity can limit coordination among echelons, mainly because of a lack of trust and consolidated supply capacity from small farmers. The foregoing requires the development of an associative structure by small producers, which is proposed as future research work.

N2  - Land Shareholding Cooperatives (LSCs) centralize management over fragmented farmland by converting farmers' plots into shares. While these cooperatives have been widely successful in boosting agricultural commercialization among rural smallholders in China, their potential has not yet been recognized in the African context. To fill this gap, we present and discuss a theoretical framework based on recent literature, an in-depth case study from Uganda and quantitative analyses of data on horticultural cooperatives from Senegal and agricultural and livestock cooperatives from Uganda, Malawi, Madagascar, Rwanda and Kenya. We uncover the existence of cooperatives built on land sharing schemes in different parts of Africa and especially in Rwanda. We find that these LSCs are more likely to mobilize collective marketing and have a higher business-membership ratio than traditional cooperatives, and we derive a few implications for policymaking.

N2  - This analysis investigates the potential mechanisms and the practical significance of agricultural value chain development in a geographically challenging rural area of a developing country. Using data from a carefully designed primary survey administered in a hill and mountainous region in Western Nepal, we show that linking small-scale producers to regional and local traders can help increase income. Analysis of impact pathways shows that the positive impact on household income emerges through higher agricultural income, driven by higher sale volume at lower prices. Focusing on high value commodities in rural areas, where arable land is not always fully exploited or utilized, appears to lead to acreage expansion and some crop switching, contributing to higher supply albeit at lower prices. The positive impact on household income is practically significant; it helps improve household food security and asset accumulation. These findings are robust to alternative specifications. Targeted value chain interventions that strengthen and stabilize small-scale producers' access to markets can contribute to rural poverty reduction via increase in agricultural income.

N2  - This paper estimates the heterogeneous effects of cooperative membership on smallholder farmers' financial performance, measured by net returns, return on investment (ROI), and profit margin. We employ an innovative two-stage predictor substitution model combined with an unconditional quantile regression model to address the endogeneity of the cooperative membership variable and analyze data collected from 626 banana farmers in China. Results, in general, show that cooperative membership improves banana farm financial performance. Particularly, we show that cooperative membership affects net returns and ROI positively and significantly across the selected unconditional quantiles, with the highest impact occurring at the highest 80th quantile. Cooperative membership also has a positive and significant impact on the profit margin for all quantiles (except for the 20th quantile), but the larger impacts occurring at the lower quantiles.

N2  - Efforts to improve cacao value chains often assume that production of fine and flavor varieties will raise smallholder incomes. Undertaking postharvest practices of fermentation and drying is another exercise assumed to increase value-added capture by smallholder producers. This study employs household data from 340 cacao farms in 15 villages in coastal Ecuador during 2018 to empirically assess these assumptions. Contrary to the common belief of the international development community, we find that the production of fine and flavor cacao varieties has no association with the price received by small-scale producers. This is mainly due to (i) low productivity and (ii) nonexistent price premiums. Findings also suggest that the use of postharvest practices of fermentation and drying may lead to substantial price responses irrespective of the type of variety grown. The results presented here have implications for program interventions aimed at increasing farmer revenue. Programs promoting the use of fine and flavor varieties alone might be misguided and can be improved by training in modern processing techniques, regardless of the variety produced.

N2  - Private firms in monopsony undertake disruptive innovation like contract farming (CF), where the firm invests in the food supply chain, provides credit, assumes the risk, and implements management strategies. This study investigates the impact of monopsonist involvement in CF and its impact on food security indicators among smallholders. Findings reveal that the monopsonist CF structure for ginger processing in Nepal increases the market price by about 18%, yields by 10%, and profits by 66%. However, the impact varies with farm size. Small farms (<=0.51 hectares [ha]) engaged in CF have higher yields (18%), earn higher profits (81%), and receive higher market prices (12%) than small non-contract ginger producers. Contrary to popular belief, disruptive innovation in value chains by monopsonists could lead to higher yields, the market price received, and profitability for both small and large farmers.

N2  - Domestic animals, especially small ruminants, are an important source of income for millions of smallholder farmers, particularly women, in Senegal. The aim of this study was to understand the place of the bovine and caprine milk value chains and to identify the role and challenges for women in the Fatick livestock production sector. A survey was conducted among a sample of 50 female producers, including 30 and 20 from the bovine and caprine milk value chains, respectively. Descriptive statistics were performed to compare the caprine and bovine milk value chains in terms of activities, products, and implications for household incomes while showing the place of women at different links of these value chains. The result of the study showed that the bovine milk value chain provided higher income compared to the caprine's, but the latter was found to be more diverse in terms of milk-derived products with increased income opportunities' potential. Remoteness, lack of equipment, and cultural biases were reported to be the main constraints in the caprine value chain, while milk price fluctuations were reported to be the biggest challenge for producers in the bovine milk value chain. Access to land and government subsidy programs and domestic time management were the main and specific challenges affecting women in the bovine and caprine value chains. Therefore, there is a need for the establishment of policies and interventions that consider the needs, opportunities, and complementarity offered by both the caprine and bovine milk value chains across smallholder women settings, while putting gender mainstreaming at the center of the discussions and reforms.

N2  - Zimbabwe has experienced a rise in supermarkets despite its volatile macroeconomic environment. Using data elucidated from key informants in the supermarket retail sector, the study observes that Zimbabwe is still relatively attractive to foreign investors as its food retail sector is not yet saturated. Zimbabwe's supermarket expansion is driven by the entry of global, regional, and home-grown chains, growing urbanisation and an upsurge in consumerism. Unlike other African countries, Zimbabwe supermarket sector is unique due to its historical footprint, macroeconomic and policy uncertainty. Supermarket development challenges include exclusion of small farmers, modernising procurement systems, difficult operating environment characterised by liquidity crisis, hyperinflation, energy shortages, and deficient infrastructure. Future supermarket growth could emerge from a more stable macroeconomic environment, improved backbone infrastructure, upgrading value chains and penetration of untapped markets in second tier cities and small rural towns.

N2  - Access to credit is a key prerequisite for the development of smallholder agriculture. However, rural credit markets are typically characterized by market failures and smallholder credit access is limited. Resource-providing contracts are an institutional tool to overcome credit market failures through the provision of production inputs in the form of in-kind credit. Previous research has shown that interlinkage of contract and credit helps farmers overcome financial constraints, foster production investments, and hence increase productivities and income. However, if and how such contract schemes affect farmers' overall demand for and access to formal credit from other sources is not yet well understood. In this article, we therefore investigate the associations of the provision of in-kind credit and farming households' formal credit demand and ability to receive formal credit. We use data of 463 oil palm producers in Ghana and show that participation in contract farming is associated with an increase in credit demand. Concerning credit approval, we find that the outstanding debt of the in-kind credit scheme is associated with a substantially lower likelihood of credit acceptance. However, the results also suggest that farmers can fully compensate this negative effect by informing the bank about the contract, and thus the source of the debt. This indicates that debt acquired from resource-providing contract schemes does not necessarily pose an additional credit constraint to farmers.

N2  - Despite women's large contributions to agricultural production in developing countries, they are often excluded from market-facing activities. There is little evidence on how to increase their participation in commercial agriculture. We designed a private sector intervention to encourage male outgrowers in Uganda to transfer a sugarcane contract to their wife or to register a previously uncontracted block in her name. A randomized controlled trial indicates that given some encouragement, men are willing to transfer rights to their wives for cane blocks of significant quality and value. Increased cane ownership by women increased women's participation in cane management and marketing activities.

N2  - Goat is a source of cash income to smallholders in many developing countries. The productivity of goat farmers is poorly understood and assumed similar across all households. Cooperatives are hailed as an institution that can provide market power to smallholders in developing countries. We assess the impact of cooperatives on the technical efficiency of goat farmers in Nepal. Multistage sampling and in-person interviews were used to collect information from 334 nonmember and 327 member cooperative farmers from two prominent goat production districts in Nepal. We use translog production function to calculate the technical efficiency. The endogeneity associated with cooperative membership is addressed through an instrumental variable approach. The one-step analysis was used to avoid bias due to the one-sided stochastic frontier analysis error. All conventional inputs have significant and positive impact on performance. Cooperative membership shows positive and significant impact on technical efficiency. The average technical efficiency score of cooperative members was 93.2%, while of nonmembers was 90.7%, and the difference was significant. Variables positively affecting technical efficiency include number of family members in agriculture, education, and training on goat production. Cooperative membership encourages farmers to embark on commercial production, fodder tree planting, farm byproducts utilization and kitchen waste utilization.

N2  - This study investigates how the transfer of rural land contract management rights in China has influenced the choice of rural workers to work in cities in the long run. Using data from the Rural Household Survey and Migrant Household Survey from the China Household Income Project in 2007, 2008 and 2013, we find that rural land transfers and the subsequent human capital effect are found to play important roles in farmers' decision to give up agricultural work and relocate to work in urban areas. Our findings indicate that the Chinese government should accelerate the implementation of policies that promote the separation of ownership rights, contracting rights and management rights of contracted land and continuously improve the rural land property rights system.

N2  - Contract and trust are the two main governance mechanisms that influence actors' integration into value chains. Nevertheless, most studies treat trust as a complement to formal contract, paying less attention on the circumstances in which trust becomes a sole mechanism of governance. The aim of this article is to examine how trust shapes integration in the non-industrial timber value chain in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. Timber, which is the pillar of the districts' revenue in the area, contributes significantly to the income of smallholder households. The study adopted an exploratory cross-sectional study design whereby data were collected mainly through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with actors of the timber value chain. The findings showed that spot market and relational governance were the two main linkages in the timber value chain. Spot market linkage is characterized by absence or little trust, while some trust is present in relational linkage. In relational linkage, trust helps integration of actors in the value chain through enabling them access market information, capital in the form of credit, technology for processing timber, and coordination and collaboration among the actors. However, trust is associated with some challenges and to some actors, it plays an exclusionary role. The study recommends for the promotion of trust along with other social control mechanisms such as social knowledge in order to address these challenges.

N2  - The increasing demand for high-value agricultural products such as fresh fruit presents opportunities for farmers in developing countries due to their higher market value compared with traditional staple crops. This study uses data on trust, risk, and time preferences obtained through behavioral experiments, combined with a discrete choice experiment to understand their effect on farmers' choices of marketing attributes, collecting data from 252 farmers from Eastern Rwanda. The results reveal that farmers, overall, have positive attitudes toward collective marketing channels with guaranteed immediate payments, written contracts, provision of inputs, credit, and training, a personal relationship with a buyer, and low investment costs. Additionally, farmers with lower levels of risk aversion were found to have a greater preference for immediate payment than farmers with higher levels of risk aversion. Farmers with higher future orientation are more likely to choose contracts that guarantee inputs and/or services and written contracts, and they attach lower relative importance to immediate payments than farmers with lower future orientation. Farmers with higher trust levels attach lower relative importance to immediate payments, written contracts, and a personal relationship with a buyer than farmers with lower trust levels.

N2  - In this article, we investigate whether lending institutions perceive smallholder (individual) farmers as riskier borrowers than farm cooperatives. Our research results show that individual farmers in Ghana are less likely to be successful in obtaining credit than cooperative farmers, because they are perceived to be riskier borrowers. In addition, results show that the willingness of lending institutions to provide loans is higher for those farmers who are associated with cooperative societies. This suggests that individual farmers can increase their odds of securing loans by joining a cooperative society. Empirical results also support the hypothesis that the interest rate is a significant predictor of the willingness to loan bias among lending institutions. In addition, our results indicate that higher interest rates are associated with increased loan risk. However, when interest rate is higher, longer loan maturity can dampen the effect of interest rate. In other words, an increase in loan maturity length reduces the effect of interest rate on the loan risk. These research results have important policy implications for the welfare of smallholder farmers in developing economies as lack of financing has a significant impact on smallholder farmer productivity.

N2  - We use a stochastic frontier approach corrected for self-selection to separate technology and managerial gaps between the treatment and control groups of smallholders in baby corn production in India. We also assess the impact of contract farming on output prices, profitability, and resource usage. We find that technical efficiency is consistently higher among contract farmers than among independent farmers and that significant technology and managerial gaps exist between contracted and independent growers. Ultimately, contract farming intervention benefits the livelihood of smallholders, increases efficiency, and reduces environmental degradation without compromising yield.

N2  - Contract farming has gained in importance in many developing countries. Previous studies analysed effects of contracts on smallholder farmers' welfare, yet mostly without considering that different types of contractual relationships exist. Here, we examine associations between contract farming and farm household income in the oil palm sector of Ghana, explicitly differentiating between two types of contracts, namely simple marketing contracts and more comprehensive resource-providing contracts. Moreover, we look at different income sources to better understand how both contracts are linked to farmers; livelihood strategies. We use cross-sectional survey data and regression models. Issues of endogeneity are addressed through measuring farmers' willingness-to-participate in contracts and using this indicator as an additional covariate. Farmers with both types of contracts have significantly higher household incomes than farmers without a contract, yet with notable differences in terms of the income sources. Farmers with a marketing contract allocate more household labour to off-farm activities and thus have higher off-farm income. In contrast, farmers with a resource-providing contract have larger oil palm plantations and thus higher farm incomes. The findings suggest that the two contract types are associated with different livelihood strategies and that disaggregated analysis of different income sources is important to better understand possible underlying mechanisms.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this research is to study the Colombian avocado export industry, identify key insights associated with creating and sustaining the avocado value chain, and to understand the impact of the public policies affecting this industry. Design/methodology/approach: The approach consists of two case studies to shed light on the opportunities and challenges of developing a sustainable avocado value chain in Colombia. One case deals with a vertically integrated business (Arcangel Miguel) while the other focuses on an association of small growers (Asohass). The analysis was informed by a series of interviews with key actors along the avocado supply chain to uncover the business strategies to move avocados to destination markets. The authors compare and contrast approaches to business development, international expansion, and role of public policies. Findings: The authors found that the strategies followed by these organizations differ in means but aim for the same objective: maximize profits, improve environmental performance, and enhance the social wellbeing of growers. The authors found that each type of business model requires distinct public policies to succeed and different strategies to appropriately allocate efforts. The findings are relevant to other high-value crops and other Latin American countries with similar geographical and social characteristics.

N2  - Despite their economic importance, some export-oriented cash crops inherently have low nutritional value for smallholder farmers in developing countries, where the prevalence of malnutrition and food insecurity remains alarming. This paper investigates the nutritional effects of a multi-faceted nutrition-sensitive agricultural programme, uniquely designed to address food and nutrition insecurity among smallholder cocoa, coffee and cashew farmers in Sierra Leone. Estimation of programme effects is done using the inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment, which addresses potential selection bias on observables and accommodates multiple programme exposure. We do not find a positive effect on household and individual dietary outcomes of the production-focused component, unless it is complemented with nutrition education. The analysis shows that combining both cash crop production and nutrition interventions significantly improves household, maternal and children's dietary diversity and, more importantly, the intake of micronutrient-rich foods among smallholder cash cropping households. This result holds after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity using the correlated random effects model. We found improvements in nutrition knowledge, and women's confidence to be the potential pathways linking the combined intervention to better dietary outcomes.

N2  - Smallholder farmers' preferences for participation in contract farming may take the form of proportional data--whereby farmers only sell some proportions or fractions of their output to contractors. We analyze determinants for preferences for zero (potential corner solution) and proportional amounts of milk that farmers sell through contract farming, using dairy farmers' data from Zambia. Bayesian linear, linear probability, and hurdle models are compared with a Bayesian zero-one inflated beta regression. Monte Carlo simulations show that alternative models are biased. Meanwhile, empirical findings suggest that gender and marital status of the household head, household size, and delayed payment significantly drive preferences for proportional milk sales in contract farming. Additionally, household size, experience selling through milk collection centers, total livestock units, access to dairy marketing information, and a buyer's milk price, among others, tend to affect zero-inflated outcomes. We recommend a Bayesian zero-one inflated beta regression model for proportional data and also provide strategies to overcome farmer-engagement barriers in contract farming.

N2  - Strengthening linkages with markets along the value chain is a promising pathway to increase agricultural productivity, welfare, and food security of smallholder producers in developing countries. Our study investigates the impact of an integrated value chain project, which linked producer organizations to markets and provided various types of training to their members. Using primary survey data from Nepal, we apply propensity score matching to ensure common support and statistical balance between project (treatment) and non-project (control) households. We implement the selectivity-corrected stochastic production frontier methodology to control for unobservable characteristics and estimate a simulation-based stochastic metafrontier to account for different technological levels between the two groups of households. Comparing results between the translog and Cobb-Douglas production frontiers, we find that the more flexible translog specification shows no signs of selectivity bias while this bias is present with the Cobb-Douglas, motivating the need to correct for selectivity. Our main results from the metafrontier analysis indicate that project impacts are reflected in substantial technological gaps and significant meta-technical efficiency differences in favor of treatment households. Thus, this study shows that strengthening linkages between producers and markets can have a large positive effect on productivity. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that more vulnerable producers, including those with fewer years of education and smaller farms, receive relatively higher returns from the project compared to their counterparts.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses cross-sectional data collected in 2018 from 932 smallholder litchi farmers in Guangdong Province and Guangxi Province in southern China. A Poisson regression with endogenous treatment effects (ETPR) model is applied to estimate the effects of mobile Internet adoption on technology adoption extensity. Findings: The ETPR model results indicate that mobile Internet adoption can significantly enhance technology adoption extensity. In addition, the extensity of technology adoption is also determined by education level, training, share of litchi farming income, guidebook use and cooperative membership. Disaggregated analyses further confirm the positive impact of mobile Internet adoption on the number of capital- and labor-intensive technologies adopted.

N2  - Purpose: The problem of inaccessibility of finance for farm investment is a common phenomenon among farmers, especially the rural dwellers. Thus, there is a need to know how the accessibility of informal finance can be increased to increase farm investment. Therefore, this study evaluates farmers' access to informal finance and its contribution to farm investment among rural farmers in North-Central Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: A three-stage random sampling technique was employed to select 160 farmers. Primary data collected were analysed with descriptive statistics and the Heckman selection model. Findings: The study revealed that cooperative society is the major informal means of loan acquisition used by the farmers followed by Rotational Savings and Credit Associations (RoSCAs). Informal loans contributed to agricultural investment through the various operational activities involved in production. Factors influencing farmers' access to informal loans were the age, farm size and income of the farmers. Interest charged, farmers' age, farming experience, household size, education and loan duration were the drivers of the amount borrowed from the informal financing sector.

N2  - Smallholder farmers are amongst the most vulnerable communities in developing countries, lacking a stable income due to inconsistent access to markets. Aiming to tackle rural poverty, the Brazilian government established institutional markets for smallholder farmers to supply their produce to schools through a non-competitive bidding mechanism. However, participation of farmers is still limited due to the challenging decision-making process. Aspiring to contribute towards increasing their participation, this study aims to support farmers into two key decisions they face during sequential stages of the bidding process, namely whether to bid for each available school and product combination and whether subsequently to accept the awarded bids once the bids' outcome is known. A decision support system, based on two sequential MILP optimisation models, was developed and applied to the case study of Canudos settlement, guiding farmers on the optimal bidding and contract acceptance strategy. This study contributes to the decision support systems field by applying OR methods to a real-life problem within a new context. It is the first application of an OR-based decision support system in the non-competitive bid/no-bid literature, defining an optimal bidding strategy through the application of optimisation methods to maximise profitability while removing subjectivity from the decision-making process. Moreover, it is the first decision support system within the bid/no-bid decision-making field being applied to the agricultural and institutional market context. The proposed approach could have a significant social impact for smallholder farmers in Brazil, improving their living conditions by providing security of income and strengthening inclusive agricultural growth.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of clan social capital on the willingness to pay (WTP) and WTP value for collective biogas investment. Design/methodology/approach: Using the Heckman two-stage model and a dataset of 1,265 representative observations from three provinces in Central China collected in 2019, this paper utilizes the contingent valuation method to estimate households' WTP value for collective biogas investment. The paper also explores the heterogeneity between households with different clan governance mechanisms and village governance structures. Findings: The results indicate that clan networks and trust were likely to improve farmer households' WTP, while clan trust and norms could improve their WTP values. For clans with councils and for clans that can influence the decision-making of village committees, their members were more likely to be influenced by the social capital of their clans to pay for collective biogas investment.

N2  - The development of entrepreneurship is one of the keys to rural poverty reduction in South Africa and the world at large. There is increasing deep concern about the worsening food security situation in several nations of the world. The onus is on the development of programs where not only men can benefit but also women, the effect and the contribution of women to the food security status rests on the development of entrepreneurship i.e. female agricultural entrepreneurs in the community. Commercialization is the basis of entrepreneurship in agriculture. Commercialization in agriculture entails more than just production but also a linkage between the household and the market. This linkage could be related to the output side or the input side. It is the aim of this study to identify the socioeconomic characteristics of the female farmers participating in a development program and to analyze the effects of the identified characteristics on their degree of commercialization. Using frequency and percentage table, parameters such as location, age, marital status, educational status, religion, household size, farming experience, farm size, number of employees, extension visits, extension source, cooperative membership, participation in a development program, entrepreneurial activity were all identified. Commercialization indices for the output and input sales were generated from the data in which the output sales were used as a dependent variable using the Ordinary Least Square regression to test for the effect of the socioeconomic characteristics on the degree of commercialization of respondents. Among the significant variables tested, educational status was positively significant, extension visit was positively significant, extension source was positively significant, membership of a cooperative society was negatively significant, participation in the development program was positively significant to the degree of commercialization. The majority indicated High entrepreneurship development.

N2  - Motivation: Most transaction cost economic frameworks, commonly used to examine and explain the co-ordination of agricultural transactions, use a linear approach for a single product transaction. This ignores the concurrence of multiple transactions by smallholder farmers in developing countries. Purpose: This study aims to understand co-ordination among multiple product transactions by smallholder farmers and to identify ways to remove impediments to market participation. It develops an adapted transaction cost framework, considering contract types and forms of market participation as building blocks for co-ordination structures. The framework was applied to explain co-ordination structures between smallholders and buyers of cotton and cereals in southern Mali. Methods and approach: To make the framework operational, we did the following: (1) selected transaction characteristics; (2) elaborated benchmarks to describe the intensity of transactions; (3) identified co-ordination structures; and (4) scored the intensity of transactions. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Findings: The majority of farmers grew cotton and sold it to a parastatal company, the sole buyer, that also supported the provision of inputs. Inputs were used to grow not only cotton, but also cereals. Most farmers sold cereals on spot markets to collectors and traders. Using different structures allowed smallholders to obtain inputs and services, to pursue different income sources over the year, and to balance flexibility and security. Policy implications: Collective organizations of smallholder farmers should be supported to improve their financial and managerial capacities to allow them to co-ordinate better with buyers and input suppliers. Institutional innovations to better balance risks for smallholders and buyers deserve consideration. These innovations include crop insurance, long-term credit, and warehouse receipts.

N2  - Many poor rural households depend on products from non-cultivated environments for subsistence and commercialization. Collective action schemes, such as community-based natural resource management (CBNRM), aim at maintaining natural resource quality and thus potentially contribute to the sustainability of environmental income sources. Little is known about whether and under which contextual conditions these schemes effectively promote environmental income generation or imply trade-offs between wildlife conservation and socioeconomic development. We rely on a unique combination of original farm-household data with a rich set of spatiotemporal covariates to quantify environmental income and dependency in Namibia's Zambezi region at the heart of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. We then estimate the effect of CBNRM on environmental income and dependency in a quasi-experimental regression-based approach. Controlling for historical variables that affected selection into formal CBNRM schemes, we further explore the role of contextual variation in exposure to tourism activity. Results suggest that CBNRM fosters livelihood strategies that are, on average, more dependent on the environment. However, this effect is driven by outcomes of households that live in close proximity to touristic enterprises, where such livelihood strategies align better with other income generating opportunities than in areas where agriculture represents the only viable economic alternative.

N2  - Using local provincial authorities, the government of Zambia has demonstrated renewed interest in cooperatives as a means of reaching smallholder farmers in rural areas. There exists, however, the problem of high heterogeneity within cooperatives regarding members' commitment, with many passive members holding only formal membership and having a minimal understanding of the cooperative's principles and benefits. The main objective of this study was to analyse how varying levels of members' commitment determine their economic benefits. We selected a total of 215 rice farmers (72 active and 143 passive members) from two rice-dominant districts and used the propensity score matching technique and endogenous treatment regression model for the analysis. The study results show that educational level, distance to the cooperative, members' perception about trust and acceptance, and value of the investment in the cooperative have a considerable influence on member commitment. The results further indicate that actively committed members of the cooperative achieve much more economic benefits than passive members.

N2  - A growing literature uses least-cost diets to evaluate how effectively a food system supports access to nutritious foods. We identify the cost of meeting nutrient requirements for whole households in rural Malawi from and the nutrient-level drivers thereof. From 2013 to 2017, we can identify a household least-cost diet only 60% of the time with an average cost of $2.32/person/day (2011 US$ PPP). We illustrate that larger households have more diverse nutrient needs and face a higher cost for 1000 calories of a sufficiently nutrient dense diet. Shadow price analysis shows riboflavin to be the costliest nutrient in the market. We use policy scenarios to understand what drives the infeasibility and high cost. Simulating the impact of selenium soil biofortification of maize results in a feasible diet 94% of the time at half the cost ($1.22/person/day on average) and eliminates the shadow price of copper. This is explained by insufficient selenium from sources low in copper such that under baseline conditions it is impossible to get enough selenium without too much copper. Even when feasible, to avoid copper, more higher cost foods enter the diet than would be otherwise needed to meet remaining nutrient requirements. Other value chain scenarios to increase the availability and lower the cost of nutrient-dense foods did not meaningfully change the diet cost results. Of direct relevance to Malawi, this study demonstrates more broadly how least-cost diet methods can be used to assess barriers to accessing an adequate diet and the potential impacts of policy options.

N2  - This study examines the dynamics of integrated aquaculture-agriculture (IAA) value chain participation and assess the determinants of participation (non-participators, continuing participators, and leavers) using three wave panel data obtained from small-scale indigenous farm households in Northern and North-eastern region of Bangladesh. We employ panel estimation strategies to control for omitted variables and endogenous regressors. The results confirm some previous findings that educated, larger family size with better access to extension, market information and community-based organisation (CBO) are more likely to participate and continue in IAA value chain activities. Importantly, farm size and farm income does not matters for IAA value chain continuous participation, suggesting that IAA value chain activities are appropriate for resource-poor households who are only able to afford low-input technology. The results also indicate that the factors influencing continued participation and dis-participation of the IAA value chain activities especially for up and downstream activities are different.

N2  - What role does traditional ecological knowledge play in the lives of smallholder farmers in post-conflict communities as they cope with the destructive impacts of war? In many cases, military weapons, such as unexploded bombs, are left behind in the surrounding landscape, forcing farmers to adapt their livelihood practices to the increased risk of death and injury. We analyze trends in the local production of knowledge in Ratanak Kiri province, Cambodia, an area heavily bombarded by the US Air Force during the Vietnam War. We argue that the system of traditional ecological knowledge has adapted to include basic information on bomb identification, location, and management strategies. This factual approach gives individuals the flexibility to generate their own views on whether they perceive unexploded ordnance as a violent hazard and/or an economic commodity. In a relatively short 50-year time period, the body of knowledge has been quickly accumulated and culturally transmitted to family and neighbors. Our findings suggest that traditional ecological knowledge should not be reduced to a static and ancient form of collective memory. We call for the expansion of the concept of traditional ecological knowledge to include short-term and dynamic processes of knowledge generation.

N2  - Recent research suggests that coupling microfinance loans with an index insurance policy may be a cost-effective way to expand credit market access to smallholder farmers in developing countries. Index insurance can increase demand for credit and encourage increased supply of credit by protecting borrowers and lenders from covariate production shocks that discourage credit market expansion. In this paper, we propose that index insurance, when bundled with credit, may also reduce a different barrier to credit market access: high transaction costs caused by moral hazard in the credit market. We develop a theoretical model of a competitive credit market with moral hazard. In this market, lenders use either dynamic incentives or collateral to mitigate the moral hazard problem. The model shows that index insurance bundled with loan contracts can reduce moral hazard and increase borrower welfare. We then test the model and find some empirical support using a subset of data from a randomised control trial in northern Ghana.

N2  - This paper investigates the extent to which households in rural Thailand across the income distribution are able to mitigate income risks in the face of shocks. It uses especially high-quality household income and consumption data spanning 64 Thai villages over 15 years. The paper identifies income shocks by village-level variations during drought conditions. It finds that richer households are better able to mitigate income risk than poorer households, in contrast to some studies of the South Asian subcontinent. These possibilities for managing income risk are shown to be correlated with the type of contract the head of household is likely to be employed in, the share of salaries in total household income, the education level of the head, the relative youth of the heads of richer households, and location effects.

N2  - The Collective Forest Tenure Reform, as a devolved forest tenure reform, was first launched in Fujian, China, in 2003, issuing forestland-use certificates to and increasing forestland access for rural households, allowing households to collateralize forestland for formal credit. This study aims to identify the impact of forestland-use certificates and household forestland and further explain their channels of impact on formal credit access. The conceptual framework in the literature includes two potential channels of impact: household's willingness to formal credit access and the institutional constraint in formal credit access. An econometric analysis was conducted using panel data of household level in Fujian province from 2012 to 2016. The econometric results demonstrated that: (1) forestland-use certificates had a significantly positive impact on the households' formal credit access when it is measured only as formal credit by collateralizing forestland; (2) household forestland had significantly positive impact on households' formal credit access when it is measured as total formal credit and formal credit by collateralizing forestland; (3) households' willingness to access credit was significantly and positively affected by forestland-use certificates and household forestland, although the impact of household forestland is more certain and (4) institutional constraint in formal credit access was significantly and positively impacted by forestland use certificates but not by household forestland. Our study contains implications on the appropriate use of formal credit as a financial instrument in devolved forest tenure reform.

N2  - Recent studies have shed light on the emergence of Southern sustainability initiatives in commodity-based value chains. These initiatives position themselves as countering the exclusionary nature of many global multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs), as critically analysed by previous studies. However, a common theoretical perspective on the inclusiveness of MSIs is still lacking. By drawing on the theory of regimes of engagement, we develop a theoretical framework which helps understanding the overt and subtle practices of including or excluding different stakeholders in MSIs. We apply this framework to 'Trustea', an Indian MSI for sustainable tea production, to further investigate the 'inclusiveness paradigm' of Southern sustainability initiatives. Our findings highlight the complexity of stakeholder engagement across the different phases of Trustea's development, from initiation and code development to formal launch and roll-out. We find that different types of engagement can exist in parallel. Justifiable engagement is expressed in the participating organisations' reference to a shared common goal of Trustea, whereas familiar engagement is linked to the rootedness of the individuals involved in the Indian tea industry. Strategic engagement, in turn, comes to the fore through the strong emphasis on developing an Indian code for sustainable tea production and promoting adoption among tea growers. The importance of reaching this objective has led to the replication of exclusionary patterns also noted for global MSIs, as small-scale producers and other weak actors have been largely excluded from decision-making processes, despite informal efforts aimed at substitution of representation.

N2  - Farmers are faced with computational and informational limitations when making marketing decisions. This holds true for Zambian dairy farmers. This study examined the factors that influence the choice of milk marketing channels among 251 smallholder farmers in Zambia participating in milk production and marketing using a multinomial logit model approach. Three milk marketing channels were identified: direct, traditional, and modern. Relative to the base category (direct), the results indicate that gender and volume of milk produced positively influenced participation in the traditional marketing channel. However, off-farm income had a negative influence on the selection of the traditional marketing channel. Gender, education, distance to major markets, and volumes of milk produced influenced the decision to participate in the modern marketing channel. There seems to be an underutilisation of the modern marketing channel. The study identified the following factors to stimulate participation in the modern marketing channel: (i) concerted value chain investments, (ii) government intervention in the form of policy changes, (iii) increased access to market information, (iv) support services, and (v) transparency in the milk value-chain. Understanding the factors that influence farmers' participation in the informal channels enables tailored policies to support the formalisation of existing structures in the informal sector.

N2  - Contract farming is typically seen as a useful mechanism to help smallholders in overcoming market access constraints. However, in spite of economic benefits, high smallholder dropout rates from contract schemes are commonplace. We use quantitative and qualitative data from Ghana to show that smallholder farmers benefit from a resource-providing contract in terms of higher yields and incomes, but that most of them still regret their decision to participate in the contract scheme and would prefer to exit if they could. The analysis underlines that research focusing on narrowly defined economic indicators alone cannot explain farmers' satisfaction with contracts and their dropout behaviour. The main problem in the contract scheme is insufficient information provided by the company. Farmers do not understand all the contract details, which leads to substantial mistrust. Farmers believe that the company behaves opportunistically, for instance during the output weighing procedure, and these beliefs are significantly correlated with the farmers' wish to exit. We conclude that issues of mistrust and lack of transparency can contribute to breakdowns of smallholder contract schemes and that such issues should receive more attention in future research on contract farming.

N2  - The main objective of this study was to examine smallholder farmers' milk and butter market participation decision and level of participation in the Ada'a Berga district. A multi-stage sampling technique employed to select 123 respondents. Heckman two stage model was used. The result of the Heckman first stage show that breed type, income from dairy, membership of dairy cooperative and milking cows have a positive and statistically significant effect on milk market participation. While, the distance from market, number milking cows, market information and non-dairy income has a positive and statistically significant effect on the farmers' decision to participate in the butter market. The second stage Heckman model result shows education, number milking cows, credit and membership of dairy cooperative have a positive and statistically significant effect on the level of milk market participation. Also, factors such as number milking cows, access to credit, dairy income and volume of milk produced have a positive and statistically significant effect on level of butter market participation. Therefore, improving breeding, education, market information, strengthening cooperative and extension and credit service can increase farmers' participation in output market.

N2  - While joining farmer cooperatives has been identified as a way for farmers, especially small farmers, to overcome their limitations in the marketplace and increase their income, this paper presents an analytical framework for examining how farmer cooperative may increase farmer income in rural China, empirically assesses the impacts of such membership on household income, and examines how the membership may affect income inequality. Data from a large-scale survey of rural households in China are used to examine the impacts of farmer cooperative membership and other factors on household income through a multivariate regression analysis and to test whether the impacts are different across income groups through a quantile regression analysis. The propensity score matching technique is used to address potential self-selection bias problems in the dataset and quantile regression is used to examine the impact for different income quantiles or groups of farmers. The empirical results indicate that farmers participating in professional cooperatives, on average, earned significantly higher income than their counterparts, but the positive impact was not statistically significant for low-income quantiles. This finding suggests that encouraging the development of and participation in farmer cooperatives could increase the average income but may not contribute directly to the policy goal of reducing income inequality in rural China.

T1  - A Place at the Table Is Not Enough: Accountability for Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities in Multi-stakeholder Platforms

N2  - Virtually all major efforts to address global problems regarding land and resource use call for a multi-stakeholder process. At the same time, there is growing interest in, and commitment to, inclusion of previously marginalized groups--e.g., Indigenous Peoples and local communities (IPLCs), smallholders, and women in these groups--in decisions related to sustainable land and resource governance. Nevertheless, multi-stakeholder platforms and forums (MSFs) tend to be idealized as imagined spaces for collaboration among equals, despite ample prior research demonstrating that fostering equity in such "invited spaces" is no easy feat. This article draws on a comparative study of 11 subnational MSFs aimed at improving land and forest use practices in Brazil, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Peru. It analyzes data from interviews with more than 50 IPLC forum participants to understand their perspective on efforts to address equity in the MSFs in which they are participating, as well as their opinion of the potential of MSFs in comparison with other participants. The research sought to understand how MSFs can ensure voice and empowerment and address inequality, and thus be accountable to the needs and interests of IPLCs. The interviews show that IPLCs are overall optimistic, but the results also provide insights into accountability failures. The article argues that to bring about change--one that takes equality, empowerment and justice seriously--there needs to be greater strategic attention to how marginalized groups perceive their participation in multi-stakeholder processes. It builds on the lessons from the literature and the findings to propose specific ways that MSFs might foster the collective action or counter power that less powerful actors need to hold more powerful actors accountable.

N2  - Microfinance is thought to be an effective tool for empowering women. Yet, previous studies that evaluate microfinance programs have mixed findings. This is in part because there are large variations in the interventions that are evaluated, but also that there is not a standardized metric of empowerment that is implemented consistently throughout the literature. This study investigates the effectiveness of a joint United Nations program aimed at empowering rural women through women-run rural savings and credit cooperatives in Oromia, Ethiopia, using the project-Women's Empowerment in Agricultural Index. Building on more than a decade of studies and validation of different versions of the Women's Empowerment in Agricultural Index, the tool aims to provide a standardized and comparable metric of women's empowerment that is flexible enough to measure impacts of development projects. This study finds that the program had a positive impact on intrinsic agency for the beneficiaries with continued access to credit through the RUSACCOs between the baseline and endline. For this group of beneficiaries, the program seemed to increase the trust and respect between spouses. There is a second group of beneficiaries that appeared to have dropped out at the initial stages of the program or lost access to credit, suggesting there may have been problems with the program or possible resistance by spouses or community members. The study expands our understanding of how to measure women's empowerment impacts of development projects within the context of a smallholder agricultural households.

N2  - Using China's National Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), a heavily subsided public medical insurance (PMI) scheme, aiming at covering all rural populations in China, as a quasi-natural experiment, we find that PMI unleashes entrepreneurship in the rural economy. This finding provides supporting evidence for Arrow's risk-shifting theory and enriches the literature on the effect of PMI that has focused mainly on health impact and consumption smoothing. We also demonstrate that PMI increases entrepreneurial investments primarily through the channel of wealth effect resulting from reduced out-of-pocket medical expenses. Besides, the entrepreneurship cultivation effect of PMI is more pronounced among rural households that are wealthier, have fuller insurance coverage, or have younger heads.

N2  - In March 2020, India declared a nationwide lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such restrictions on mobility interrupted the normal functioning of agricultural value chains. For a sample of 1767 tomato and wheat producers in the state of Haryana, we study to what extent the lockdown limited access to inputs, labor, machinery, and markets to produce, harvest, and sell their crops. We quantify crop income reductions during the first months of the lockdown and analyze to what extent these are associated with borrowing and food insecurity. We find that wheat producers, for whom state-led procurement guaranteed market access at fixed prices, suffered minimal declines in income. For tomato producers--an already more vulnerable population--income fell by 50% relative to their expected income in a normal year, largely due to a steep fall of tomato prices as they shifted from wholesale markets to local retail markets, resulting in a sharp increase in local supply. Relative to wheat producers affected by the lockdown, reduced income for tomato producers was associated with an increase in borrowing and reduced food security. We conclude that targeting producers of crops that face substantial price risk and introducing policies that stabilize market prices are important in efforts to aid recovery and build resilience of smallholder farmers.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on potato production and technical efficiency. Design/methodology/approach: A combination of propensity score matching technique and sample selection stochastic frontier framework that addresses potential selection bias due to observable and unobservable attributes is used to estimate the effect of participation between cooperative members and non-members. Using a stochastic meta-frontier approach, the technical efficiency of farmers was estimated and compared. Findings: The empirical results show that the effect of participation in agricultural cooperatives is associated with increased yield and technical efficiency. A comparison of group-specific frontiers indicates that cooperative members perform better than non-members. Cooperative membership decisions is significantly associated with household and farm characteristics (e.g. education, participation in off-farm work, total farmland, distance to market and geographic location).

N2  - This study aims to explore whether there is a deviation between farmers' willingness and behavior to adopt electricity-saving tricycles and to identify factors influencing the deviation. A total of 234 rural households in Dazu District of China were selected by using the stratified random sampling technique and interviewed face-to-face. The cross-analysis method was employed to analyze the deviation, and the binary logit model was used to investigate the influencing factors on the deviation. The results demonstrate that there is a deviation between farmers' adoption willingness and behavior. Of the 193 farmers who were willing to adopt electricity-saving tricycles, only 52 had actual adoption behaviors in their families. The inconsistency rate was more than 73%. The regression results indicate that age, whether the respondents are village cadres, and the terrain of the dwelling have positive effects on the deviation. The number of permanent residents, the diversity of income structure, the area of the dwelling, the cognition toward climate change and individual behaviors of energy use, and whether the respondents participate in rural cooperatives or not affect the deviation negatively. Our findings provide policy implications for government measures to guide the transition from the willingness to the actual adoption behavior of farmers.

N2  - Understanding the preferences of smallholder farmers for contracting can help in making contracts more sustainable. This paper presents the results of a choice experiment (CE) among smallholder farmers in Indonesia to assess their preferences for accepting contracts with modern retail. The CE was based on attributes of actual sales transactions in modern retail and traditional retail channels. A total of 301 vegetable smallholder farmers participated, consisting of 173 farmers participating in traditional markets and 128 in modern retail markets. A random parameter logit model estimates that, in general, smallholders do not prefer contracting with modern retail over spot market selling in traditional retail channels. Most contract attributes are perceived as negative by smallholders. A willingness-to-accept analysis shows that farmers are critical of most contract attributes, particularly those related to quality requirements. Producer organizations (POs) reduce transaction costs and increase smallholders' preference toward contracts. Contract designs that reduce transaction cost, mitigate risks for farmers, provide fair prices, and involve POs are more likely to attract smallholders to modern retail channels.

N2  - In this paper we descriptively investigate the Covid-19 pandemic's early impact on the fruit and vegetable supply chain in Senegal, using trade statistics and survey data collected through online questionnaires and telephone interviews with smallholder farmers, agro-industrial companies, agricultural workers, traders, importers, and consumers. Our results point to major differences in how Covid-19 and containment measures disrupt supply chains between the modern export-oriented supply chain that is centered around a few large vertically integrated agro-industrial companies, and the more traditional domestic-oriented supply chain with a large number of smallholder farmers and informal traders--with the former being more resilient to the Covid-19 shock. We show that both the modern and the traditional supply chain innovate to cope with the Covid-19 containment measures. While our study is subject to some limitations, our findings bring nuance in the debate on the resilience of the food system to the pandemic, and have important policy and research implications toward international trade, social safety measures, and food and nutrition security.

N2  - We conducted a two-treatment randomized control trial in northern Ghana to investigate how bundling index insurance with agricultural loans affects smallholder access to credit. In one treatment, farmer groups were invited to apply for production loans bundled with an index insurance contract that, in the event of a drought, indemnifies farmers directly (micro-insured loans). In the second treatment, farmer groups were invited to apply for production loans bundled with an index insurance contract that, in the event of a drought, indemnifies the lender on the condition that the indemnity be used to retire the farmer's debt obligation (meso-insured loans). Farmer groups in the control category were invited to apply for uninsured loans. We find that insured loans increase farmers' likelihood of receiving credit by between 15 and 21 percentage points. Exploring the mechanisms of this effect, we find no impact on the likelihood that farmers apply for credit but do find an increase in the likelihood of loan approvals of between 17 and 25 percentage points.

N2  - While contract farming and interlocked contractual arrangements (ICAs) are generally perceived to resolve persistent market failures and improve smallholder farmers' welfare in developing countries, uncertainties remain as to whether these arrangements enhance welfare because of farmers' low marketed volumes and margins. To account for potential selection bias, non-Gaussian and missing data problems, a robust two-stage Bayesian instrumental variable approach is used to determine the impact of dairy farmers' participation in ICAs on household income and milk revenue. Data are from smallholder dairy farmers in Zambia. We find that male household heads, wealth, experience selling to milk collection centres (MCCs), livestock holding, milking parlour ownership, landholding, and access to marketing information positively affect farmers' probability to participate in ICAs. However, increased off-farm income and distance to MCCs limit their participation. While some socioeconomic variables have significant positive effects of affecting ICA participation on household welfare, we find no sufficient evidence of causal effects of ICAs on household incomes and milk revenue among dairy farmers. Thus, while ICAs enhance smallholder farmers' access to markets, they may not address high rural poverty rates in developing countries. We provide some insights by which performance of ICAs in the dairy sector may be improved.

N2  - Smallholder farmers in developing countries encounter multiple barriers in access to inputs and technology, which prevent them from reaping the benefits from market participation. Women farmers face additional constraints due to gender norms that further limit their engagement in productive activities. While collective action has been shown to improve access to markets and economic outcomes for farmers overall, the evidence on the effects of cooperative membership for women smallholders remains limited. We investigate empirically the economic benefits of collective action for women farmers in the honey sector in Ethiopia. Relying on a rich data set on women honey producers, both cooperative members and non-members, we evaluate the effects of belonging to a cooperative on three outcome variables through coarsened exact matching and regression analysis. Our results indicate that cooperative membership significantly increases the market price and the production quantity and, while the average effect on the share of product marketed is statistically insignificant, significant differences emerge for women with given characteristics. These results are shown to be robust to a number of tests that address biases from selection on observables and unobservables. An analysis of the heterogeneous effects of household membership in multiple groups finds that membership of self-help groups or farmer associations amplifies the positive outcomes from belonging to a formal cooperative. Finally, qualitative findings derived from the same communities indicate self-reported improvements in agency and self-esteem among women members, thus reinforcing the importance of the quantitative findings.

N2  - The overall objective of this paper is to assess the impact of a value chain development project--the AVCPO in the Bale region (Oromia, Ethiopia)--on smallholder households focusing on the relationship between the food security goal (SDG2) and other SDG-related outcomes such as education (SDG4) and collective action and social capital (SDG16). Possible co-benefits and synergies among the SDGs are explored using a variety of approaches ranging from instrument variable techniques to evaluate the project overall impact on the various SDGs, multi-valued treatment effect analysis to assess which project component is more effective in achieving the expected impacts, and causal mediation modelling to evaluate to what extent collective action and social capital can play a role in achieving food security and education. Our study shows that the aggregate impact is positive and significant on most of the considered outcomes, namely food security (SDG2) except diet diversification, education (SDG4) of girls but not of boys, and collective action (SDG16), while social capital (SDG16) is significant only as far as horizontal relationships within the community are created. Disentangling the aggregate impact, we show that combined treatments (e.g. training plus storage facilities and marketing through cooperatives) generally return larger impacts than stand-alone treatments (e.g. training only). Finally, our study finds that collective action (SDG16) is an important channel that favors food security improvement (SDG2) but only to a lesser extent better education (SDG4).

N2  - Development corridors have recently gained momentum as territorial tools to attract flows of global capital into agricultural value chains. As this includes the controversial blending of public with private funding for investments into farmland, the integration of smallholders in large-scale operations is increasingly promoted as legitimatory practice. With this article, we discuss the role of finance in shaping such value chain arrangements. Using a spatially sensible financialisation perspective, we present two investment cases that have touched ground as reaction to the promotion of the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT). We assess how finance unfolded along territorial (corridor region and investment origin) and relational (investment chain and value chain) spatialities, to scrutinise the tensions and fragile outcomes that were co-constituted by mixed financial and moral investment imperatives. This helps to understand whether, why, and with what consequences smallholders can benefit from corridor-related investments.

N2  - Purpose: Agriculture in Ghana is dominated by smallholder farmers in rural areas. Majority of these farmers are resource-poor and faced with serious challenges in accessing formal financial services towards farming needs attributed to the stringent requirements. To bridge this gap, village savings and loan associations (VSLA) have been promoted in rural areas as an alternative to meeting the credit needs of smallholder farmers. Credit plays a vital role in input acquisition among farmers for improved agricultural value productivity. This study assesses the contribution of VSLA to agricultural value productivity in the Northern Region of Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is a primary cross-sectional data collected with the help of a semi-structured questionnaire. This study, therefore, applied a propensity score matching (PSM) to assess the effects of VSLA on agricultural value productivity. Findings: Results from the PSM revealed that extension contact, contract farming, television set ownership, participating in "Planting for Food and Jobs" and nature of roads, including receiving VSLA information from members' increases participation decision of farmers in VSLA. Conversely, age of a farmer, household size, distance to output market and farmers in the Sagnarigu Municipality have negatively influenced VSLA participation. The propensity score matching estimates showed that members of VSLA obtained 38.2% higher agricultural value productivity than non-members.

N2  - Contractual agreements between smallholder farmers and agribusiness companies have gained in importance in many developing countries. While productivity and income effects of contracting in the small farm sector were analyzed in many previous studies, labor market and employment effects are not yet well understood. This is an important research gap, especially against the background of continued population growth and structural transformation. Here, we investigate the effects of two types of contractual agreements between large international processing companies and smallholder farmers on agricultural labor use, household labor allocation, and hired labor demand in Ghana's palm oil sector. We use cross-sectional survey data and a willingness-to-pay approach to control for unobserved heterogeneity between farmers with and without contracts. We find that agricultural labor intensity is substantially reduced through the contracts, because contracting in Ghana is associated with the adoption of labor-saving procedures and technologies. Simple marketing contracts lead to reallocation of the saved household labor to off-farm employment, whereas resource-providing contracts lead to a stronger reallocation of labor within the farming enterprise. Household labor is more affected by labor savings than hired labor.

N2  - When the British colonial government took over Tanzania, colonial officials championed and encouraged the inhabitants in Kilimanjaro to grow coffee along with settlers. The authorities gave priority to the local smallholders, relegating settlers to a minor role within colonial agriculture and the coffee economy in particular. This generated a vigorous protest among the settlers against the government policy. The tension would bring a number of remarkable developments, including the establishment of the Kilimanjaro Native Planters Association (KNPA) and, later, the promulgation of legislation regulating coffee farming and marketing via cooperatives, such as the Co-operative Societies Ordinance No. 7 of 1932 and the Native Coffee Control Ordinance No 26 of 1937. This paper examines the interlocked dimensions and intricacies related to the coffee industry policies, and their impact on agricultural policies in Kilimanjaro region as well as across the country. In particular, the paper discusses how the settlers' opposition influenced the promulgation of segregative, monopolistic and protectionist legislations, and the role of control Boards in this process. To do so, this paper relies on existing literature as well as underutilized primary sources obtained from the Tanzania National Archives (TNA) in Dar Es Salaam.

N2  - Micro-insurance can be an effective approach to smoothening income in adverse times and potentially a way to contribute to the financial inclusion of vulnerable populations. However, direct sales to individual smallholders remains a challenging task without an easily scalable solution. The current research seeks to find the determinants of adoption of a stand-alone coffee index-based insurance product in Uganda marketed by a farmer cooperative, and elicited preferences for improving the design and delivery model. A stratified household survey was conducted among 614 farmers, of which 40% adopted insurance and 62% were member of a farmer cooperative. In odds ratio terms, adopters perceived themselves to be 3.09 times more likely to receive a pay-out than non-adopters (P < 0.01), and those having better access to extension services were 2.47 times more likely to adopt a policy (P < 0.01). Yet farmers perceiving the design as complex were approximately half as likely to adopt (P < 0.05). Farmers preferred the option of premium payments proceeds on delivery, mobile premium payments and delivering insurance through cooperatives/associations. Deepening insurance uptake among coffee farmers will therefore require a strong focus on communication and information sharing facilitated by cooperatives/associations (e.g. farmer cooperatives, village and saving associations, or women's associations).

N2  - Despite an extensive literature indicating that protected areas (PA) affect negatively local people's livelihood and can even exacerbate local poverty, a few studies found that PA can have positive effects on the local economy by promoting eco-tourism. In this study, we conducted a three-period survey of 170 rural households in Wuyi Mountain National Nature Reserve (WNR) in northern Fujian province of China during 2010-2014. We used robust random effect models to examine the effects of PA on local livelihood. A novel finding is that households (HHs) within WNR have much higher total income and total income per capita than HHs nearby WNR. HHs within WNR have a simple livelihood strategy with an extremely high dependence on the black tea industry, and HHs nearby WNR have diversified livelihood strategy with an increasing dependence on the black tea industry. Our results show that HH income is positively related to the age and education of the HH head. Membership of a large clan and financial and technical assistance can contribute to increasing HH income. HHs that engage only in farming as well as those that are a member of farm cooperative are likely to have lower income. The results also indicate a positive spill-over effect of communities within WNR on communities nearby WNR. We argue that communities within WNR should diversify their livelihood strategy to control risk, and communities nearby WNR should explore their comparative advantages rather than following the example of communities within WNR to expand black tea production.

N2  - It is widely recognized that participation in producer groups is advantageous for smallholders who must deal with complex production and marketing constraints and dynamic business environments. However, available data on this process are scarce in the fishery sector, while existing evidence is limited by smallholders' potential self-selection into producer groups. This study, therefore, examined the selectivity-corrected role of fisher groups in improving shrimpers' technological and technical efficiency. Using the latest primary data from artisan shrimpers in Nigeria, we applied propensity score matching and Greene's selectivity stochastic production frontier model to control for selection bias from both observable and unobservable factors. Empirical results from our metafrontier approach show that technical efficiency scores for members tend to be overestimated if selectivity is not properly controlled. However, the technical efficiencies and productivities of members were significantly higher regardless of how biases were corrected, implying that participation in fisher groups is positively related to increases in shrimpers' capture and technical efficiency. Further findings suggest that current artisanal fisher groups are "production-oriented" as they ensure that members access vital shrimping inputs at lower costs. With declining returns to scale for members, the study concludes that without public and private support for collective action in the fishery sector, membership in artisanal fisher groups may not lead to significant improvement in shrimpers' productivity. The study discusses several recommendations on how collective action can be further encouraged and developed among artisan fishers.

The results reveal that participation in the outgrower scheme has a significantly positive impact on farmers' rice income and output selling price. A possible implication of the results of this study is that the outgrower scheme may help increase rice households' income in the Mekong Delta.

N2  - Rice production is an increasing source of income and food security for smallholder farmers in many parts of Tanzania. Improving market access for rice farmers is essential to raise rural incomes and reduce poverty. This paper aims to determine the most efficient rice marketing channel and analyse the factors affecting marketing channel choices by smallholder rice farmers. Marketing efficiency was tested using Acharya and Aggarwal's composite index method. A multinomial logit model was used to analyse the marketing channel choices. The results showed that the miller-wholesaler marketing channel is the most efficient. The results show that most farmers in rural areas still sell their rice to local collectors because of failure, fear or inability by farmers to venture out of the farm gate into the markets. The findings suggest that there is a need to improve rural infrastructure, market information systems, smallholder access to productive assets, prudent use of credit and strengthening collective action through well-organised farmer groups in the country.

N2  - This article examines the nature of contractual relations between sugar outgrowers (contract farmers) and Tongaat Hulett Zimbabwe (THZ). Drawing from a research study conducted at Hippo Valley Estate, using a mixed-methods approach, findings reveal asymmetrical power relations in favour of THZ as reflected by its domination in price determination, monopsony control and risk sharing. Despite radicalisation and attempts by the state to curb the powers of international finance, the article argues that monopoly capital continues to wield significant control in Zimbabwe, leading to growing farmer indebtedness. Thus, the state-capital alliance presents a stumbling block for accumulation by sugar outgrowers.

N2  - This paper examines the impact of rice value chain participation and social networks on smallholder farmers' market performance outcomes (paddy price, quantity of paddy traded, and net returns), using data from a recent survey of 458 smallholder rice farmers in northern Ghana. We employed a treatment effects model to account for potential selection bias associated with observable and unobservable factors. The empirical results reveal that smallholder farmers' participation in a rice value chain is associated with increased paddy price, quantity traded, and net returns. We also find that value chain participation decisions and market performance are positively and significantly influenced by social networks. The empirical results also suggest that sex, farm size, mobile phone ownership, and access to credit significantly increase paddy prices, quantity traded, and net returns of smallholder rice farmers in the value chain.

N2  - Entrepreneurial new firms can bring in radical innovations better with a risk-taking approach. Startups have been proliferating in all sectors of the economy including agriculture in developing countries in recent years. This paper harnesses a large database of start-ups in India and examines the nature of innovations of the start-ups employing open innovation framework. Several types of startups have come up in the last decade that are filling the gaps in the food value chains in infrastructure deficit regions of the country and introducing innovations by mobilising 8 billion USD investments. This fast-expanding knowledge flows have brought several innovations that could not be imagined just a few years back. Significantly, open innovation has taken root in Indian agriculture with the rise of startups and this has several positive implications. Open innovation is required at the present stage as Indian agriculture is in transition and moving towards a higher level of technologies with better and faster linkages among various food chain actors. There are concerns that need to be addressed about this innovation, bypassing the smallholders, as companies can only plan for their own innovations and marketing. The government needs to develop a policy framework to create the necessary enabling environment for the development of the startup ecosystem and to internalise and mainstream this open innovation into agricultural development strategies keeping the twin goals of growth and equity.

N2  - Voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) in the coffee sector have become a popular tool to improve the livelihoods of smallholder coffee farmers. As third-party and company-led VSS have proliferated, an increasing number of producer groups are turning toward multiple certification to diversify their export channels. Yet, each certification requires added efforts and expenses, both at the farm and the organisational level. Hence, it is important to evaluate the additionality of multiple certification in bringing benefits to smallholders' farm economy. This study addresses this research gap using a sample of over 600 coffee farmers from two Fairtrade-certified cooperatives in Colombia's coffee belt to assess the additional economic impact of Starbucks C.A.F.E. Practices, Nespresso AAA, 4C, and the combination of Rainforest Alliance/Nespresso AAA certification. In examining coffee gross profit and household income, we find limited gains from the addition of industry and company-led standards to the Fairtrade certification. Evaluating pathways to improved economic performance, gross profit improvements appear most likely if higher average prices are combined with lower production costs. Finally, we show that the majority of farmers are unable to break even, irrespective of their certification status. This alarming result illustrates the need for further intervention in the coffee value chain.

N2  - To increase agricultural exports across the Global South, countries are seeking to transform agrarian landscapes and the nature of campesino or smallholder agriculture. These agricultural reforms, however, do not exist in isolation. They work in conjunction with water policy reform to reshape agricultural systems and the people who manage these landscapes. While there has been significant research on agrarian change under neoliberal reform, few scholars have conducted empirical studies that examine how agricultural policy leverages water policy reform to generate changes across agricultural landscapes. Drawing on the case study of the Piura River basin in Northern Peru, this paper first explores how the IWRM inspired 2009 Water Resources Law furthers the state's agricultural development priorities by shifting water toward agro-export production. Secondly, this study demonstrates how climate change is being discursively mobilized as an emerging driver of water scarcity to legitimize these water reallocations. Thirdly, this case highlights how these water reallocations work in concert with the reinstatement of targeted agricultural support programs that seek to transform smallholder farmers into "agro-export entrepreneurs" but with meaningful exclusions. This study contributes to the limited scholarship on the 2009 Water Resources Law in Peru and also raises broader questions regarding how IWRM water management, climate change adaptation discourse, and agricultural development policy collectively promote the globalization of smallholder agriculture.

N2  - A common and driving assumption in agricultural research is that the introduction of research trials, new practices and innovative technologies will result in technology adoption, and will subsequently generate benefits for farmers and other stakeholders. In Lao PDR, the potential benefits of introduced technologies have not been fully realised by beneficiaries. We report on an analysis of a survey of 735 smallholder farmers in Southern Lao PDR who were questioned about factors that influenced their decisions to adopt new technologies. In this study, we have constructed measures or states of adoption which identify key elements of an adoption decision-making nexus. Analysis was conducted to statistically group explanatory factors of adoption. The key explanatory factors represented attributes of the farmer, the factors considered when undertaking production decisions and elements of the agricultural value chain that present as opportunities or constraints. We describe the combination of farmer's personal attributes, perceptions of the value chain, and the introduction of new technologies by external actors as an "agricultural research value chain", where agricultural research activities intervene to derive greater benefits for local farmers. A generalised linear model, via Poisson (multiple) regression analysis on the identified explanatory factors, was applied to explore how they influence adoption measures and we found several significant relationships.

N2  - Valorising the biocultural heritage of common goods could enable peasant farmers to achieve socially and economically inclusive sustainability. Increasingly appreciated by consumers, peasant heritage products offer small farmers promising opportunities for economic, social and territorial development. Identifying the obstacles and levers of this complex, multi-scale and multi-stakeholder objective requires an integrative framework. We applied the panarchy conceptual framework to two cases of participatory research with small quinoa producers: a local fair in Chile and quinoa export production in Bolivia. In both cases, the "commoning" process was crucial both to bring stakeholders together inside their communities and to gain outside recognition for their production and thus achieve social and economic inclusion. Despite the differences in scale, the local fair and the export market shared a similar marketing strategy based on short value chains promoting quality products with high identity value. In these dynamics of biocultural heritage valorisation, the panarchical approach revealed the central place as well as the vulnerability of the community territory. As a place of both anchoring and opening, the community territory is the privileged space where autonomous and consensual control over the governance of common biocultural resources can be exercised.

N2  - Colombia is the largest supplier of coca leaf in the world, and fields smaller than one-hectare account for more than 60 per cent of cultivation. Despite the obvious relevance of smallholding growers to the strategies to control illicit crops, there are few insights into what motivates these smallholders to cultivate coca. We analyse the motivations of coca growers by estimating a discrete choice model including head of household characteristics, household variables, and agricultural unit attributes. We found that extremely poor farmers are more likely to grow coca than non-poor farmers in the same area, while households connected to the energy grid, with access to credit, and receiving cash payments for their licit crops, are less likely to grow coca crops. Our results suggest that strategies aiming to discourage farmers from growing coca should: 1) target specifically the poorest households in the region and not just seek to improve general living conditions, 2) expand rural electrification, and 3) enhance legal productivity by providing access to credit, technical support, and/or contracts on harvests before planting.

N2  - The benefits of tomato to human health among the vegetable family cannot be overemphasized. Tomatoes are grown for home consumption in the backyard of many households across sub-Saharan Africa. They are important sources of vitamins as well as essential cash crop for both smallholders and medium-scale commercial farmers. A number of studies have shown that tomato is grown in commercial quantity anywhere agronomic conditions allow. In Nigeria and many countries of the world, tomato has become one of the most important crops in agriculture for smallholder farmers both for processing and fresh market. This paper analyses the supply side of the market for tomato in Bauchi State, Nigeria. The data employed were purposively obtained from farmers, wholesalers and retailers from agricultural areas in 7 Local Government Areas of Bauchi State. These include Bauchi, Alkaleri, Toro, Kari, Shira, Darazo, and Ganjuwa. Analysis is mainly predicated on the weighted least squares regression in order to address the problems that may arise from having heteroskedastic errors in the models. The findings show that farm characteristics majorly affect supply of tomatoes while handling costs and cooperative membership are mainly responsible for loss of tomatoes across the marketing chain. Also, cooperative membership does not play a significant role in improving the situations of neither the farmers nor the middlemen in terms of increased profitability and supply. In addition, socioeconomic and farm characteristics are found to be key factors affecting tomatoes' profitability. Therefore, farmers should be encouraged to embrace a competitive market setting in order to achieve a free flow market interaction in the determination of price. A favourable farm-land ownership and acquisition policy should be made by government in order to increase output of tomatoes and consequently, higher profitability. This is most likely to have a positive influence on employment generation as more rural populace would be engaged in the production of farm products. Besides, infrastructural development, specifically in the area of transportations needs to be enhanced by the government in order to ease movement of agricultural produce from the point of harvest to their final destinations. Attention should also be given to government investment in storage facilities to minimize the spoilage level of farm produce in Nigeria. Farm cooperatives should be reformed so as to promote profitability of the agricultural firms.

N2  - Purpose: The participation of smallholder farmers in modern supply chains is an important contribution to rural economic development and poverty reduction. Contract farming has emerged as an institutional response to market failures, with the potential to reduce farmers' production risks, increase investments in inputs and technologies, thereby achieving higher productivity and income. The aim of this study is to define the contract farming, to describe the historical development process in the world and in Turkey, to introduce successful examples of contract farming and to explain DITAP platform established by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry under the contract farming model. Design/Methodology/Approach: In this study, firstly, a conceptual analysis is made for contract farming based on the important studies in the literature. In this context, the concept of contract farming is explained, the historical development is introduced and current status of contract farming in Turkey and in the world is examined. Finally, the structure, functioning and contribution of the contract farming platform established by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Turkey to the rural development are examined. Findings: As the historical development and the current situation of contract farming in the world economy are analysed, it is determined that contract farming supports rural economic development, Turkey has a high potential in contract farming, and in this context, DITAP is as an important platform to support our Turkey's agricultural policies. Originality/value: This study is valuable in terms of demonstrating that contract farming is an important tool for rural development especially in developing countries, and considering the application of contract farming model in Turkey.

N2  - While previous studies analyzed the welfare effects of smallholder participation in supermarket channels, little is known about the effects over time of supplying supermarkets on farm household incomes and diets, possible trade-offs, and opportunity costs of supermarkets on different income sources. We use panel data from smallholder vegetable farmers in Kenya to address these research gaps. The results show that supermarket contracts increase overall income by 61% and the dietary diversity score of nutritious foods by 4%, on average. Supermarket contracts also increase farm income without sacrificing income from other sources. In terms of participation dynamics, supermarket stayers and dropouts achieve overall income gains, but newcomers do not immediately benefit, due to their huge initial capital investment. Supermarket participation is not a panacea for all smallholder marketing and livelihood challenges but benefits farmers who can meet contractual requirements.

N2  - This paper describes the structure and estimation of a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) of Kenya for the year 2014. Among its specificities, this SAM includes a very high disaggregation of the agri-food sector and accounts for the double role of households as producers and consumers. Accounting for these characteristics is crucial to provide robust socioeconomic analysis in the context of developing countries. Indeed, this type of database is valuable to perform ex-ante evaluations of economic policies with various economic models and techniques. In this paper, we present an application with a linear multiplier analysis (backward linkages and value chain decomposition). The results show the capacity of the primary sector in Kenya to generate value added and employment, with this growth distributed more intensely in rural households whose main livelihood is semi-subsistence agriculture.

N2  - Despite the fact that contracting facilitates farmer participation in agrifood value chains, evidence on farmers' participation in different forms of contracts and the impact on farm performance is still limited. This study examines the determinants and impacts of vertical coordination mechanism-spot market transactions, written, and verbal contract-on-farm performance of rice farmers in northern Ghana, using a multinomial BFG model to account for selectivity bias. The findings indicate that vertical coordination participation decision is significantly influenced by age, access to credit, labor, association membership, and sales to institutional buyers. The empirical results also reveal significant gains in farm performance outcomes from participating in written and verbal contracts, relative to spot market transactions.

N2  - Attaining food and income security is a persistent challenge among small holder farmers of Southern Africa. Improved sorghum varieties are widely regarded as a panacea to extreme poverty. The paper uses endogenous switching regression to determine impacts of improved sorghum varieties intensification on household welfare. Household dietary diversity score and household food insecurity access score were used as outcome variables and proxies for food security. Cross-sectional data were generated in the Mid Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe in 2016 from 380 households in a survey conducted with five purposively selected wards. Social association groups, average weighted market prices, household income, age of principal decision maker, dependency ratio, ownership of draught power and storage facilities have significant (p < 0.01) implications on the adoption decision. Counterfactual analyses shows that farmers who allocate more land towards improved sorghum varieties are relatively better off in food diversity and food access. Intensifying improved sorghum varieties can increase dietary diversity by 35% while reducing food insecurity by 29-34%. Social networking can be strengthened through local, government and private partnerships to facilitate generation and efficient dissemination of sorghum production and marketing information. Improving the market prices can increase market size and enhance efficiency along strategic value chain nodes.

N2  - India's dairy sector has emerged as the world's largest dairy producer and has enabled 70 million farmers to generate income through its rapid growth. This success is linked to broad national policy support through the Operation Flood program and the emergence of an inclusive model of cooperatives. However, the informal sector is still the marketing channel most used by dairy producers, and with the liberalization of the dairy sector, the cooperative model is also facing competition from the private sector. By surveying 244 dairy farmers in two major but heterogeneous states in India, this paper examines the inclusiveness of the sector and the impact of dairy cooperative membership on farmers' income and livelihood. The originality of the paper concerns its systematic perspective on households' assets and activities. The results indicate that cooperative membership is associated with caste membership and farmers collection centers. Better incomes are associated with membership, particularly among farmers with less land and among smallholders, who are more dependent on their dairy income to lift themselves out of poverty.

N2  - Although many studies analyzed effects of sustainability standards--such as Fairtrade or Rainforest Alliance--on smallholder farmers in developing countries, most did not sufficiently account for systematic differences between certified and noncertified farmers. Certified farmers are typically organized in cooperatives. When sampling only from a small number of cooperatives, as previous studies did, it is not easy to disentangle certification effects from possible cooperative effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by randomly sampling from a large number of cooperatives, thus better capturing existing institutional heterogeneity. In particular, we collect and use data from cocoa farmers in Cote d'Ivoire who are organized in Fairtrade-certified and noncertified cooperatives. Regression models with instrumental variables show that Fairtrade has positive and significant effects on cocoa yields, prices, and living standards. These effects remain significant also after controlling for cooperative characteristics, but the magnitude of the estimates changes. We draw two conclusions. First, in Cote d'Ivoire, Fairtrade certification benefits farmers economically. Second, and more generally, cooperative characteristics are jointly correlated with certification and relevant outcomes, which needs to be accounted for to avoid bias when evaluating the benefits of sustainability standards in the small farm sector.

N2  - Most developing-country farms are small and engage in cooperative agriculture. Prior literature has argued that mechanisms aimed at facilitating smallholder coordination such as cooperatives are central to stimulating market participation. At the same time, cooperatives have not always been able to engage in collective action. In this paper, we conduct neutrally framed coordination games and a natural field experiment to test the effect of cheap talk among members of groundnut-producing cooperatives in Senegal. In both experiments, we ask farmers how much they intend to contribute to the group prior to them actually doing so and then, confidentially reveal aggregate intentions to other cooperative members. Based on survey and administrative data, we find that (1) revealing farmers' intentions improves collective commercialization and this effect increases with group size and (2) learning in the lab transfers to behavior in the day-to-day environment. Implications for policy and future work are discussed.

N2  - Energy justice is an important concept drawing attention to fairness and equity in the transition to clean energy. Recently, a theme that highlights procedural and distributive injustices of energy transition in authoritarian regimes, particularly China, has emerged in the literature. This study challenges this perspective with an examination of China's photovoltaic poverty alleviation initiative (PVPA)--a policy that aims to ease poverty through a clean energy transition in rural areas. The evidence collected from interviews and surveys shows that a just energy transition has been achieved by the PVPA in two ways. First, from a just procedure perspective, there are institutionalized mechanisms ensuring procedural justice, including public consultation conducted at the village level and the disclosure of information regarding the distribution of benefits. Second, from a just outcome perspective, the PVPA has made a positive material impact on poor rural households, and more broadly, village collectives. These findings show that just energy transitions in authoritarian regimes are possible, but they assume a path in which top-down politics, rather than bottom-up pressure, is the key driving force.

N2  - Smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa often mitigate production risks through cooperative membership: institutionalized arrangements where they pool resources and collectively manage production and marketing chains. Cooperative membership has a significant advantage: it cushions detrimental effects of external forces, placing a premium on a risk-seeking attitude (experimenting and innovating), which can yield greater accumulation. However, cooperatives are self-selective institutions: relatively better-endowed farmers, who are usually less risk-avoidant than poorer ones (a consequence of their broader material bases), tend to be overrepresented. These two realities complicate the causal assessment of the relationships between risk attitudes, farmers' socioeconomic status, and cooperative membership that is essential to comprehend the role of cooperatives in local capital accumulation. To help resolve this thorny analytical problem, an experimental study was carried out in eastern Ethiopia--a risky production environment where cooperatives feature prominently and relatively affluent farmers exist alongside poorer ones. It unveils the working of specific path dependences: poorer cooperative members are less risk seeking than nonmembers, but at an interval much less than that observed for affluent farmers. For development policies, this suggests that a greater payoff can be expected from investing in farmers' material bases than from further improving cooperative membership.

N2  - This study evaluates the welfare benefits of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), the main public health insurance plan for the rural population in China. The findings show that the value of the NCMS to recipients is slightly lower than the government's costs of implementation, ranging from 0.79 to 0.97 per RMB of the resource cost of the NCMS. The estimated moral hazard costs are low compared with the total benefits. It is also estimated that the benefits originating from the NCMS's insurance function only constitute 20 percent of the total benefits, suggesting a need for higher generosity levels among rural households. Our results shed new light on the welfare effects of access health insurance among low- and middle-income households.

N2  - Contract farming (CF) has been offered as a solution to missing markets in developing economies. However, little is known as to how the presence of CF affects production risk, technical efficiency and risk attitudes of the smallholder. This study investigates production risk, technical efficiency, output price uncertainty and risk attitudes of contract and independent farmers. Using a Bayesian estimation method and farm-level data from Nepal, we find that contract farmers are more risk-averse than the independent farmers. Contract farmers can increase output by reducing the scale more than independent farmers. We find that labour and capital are risk-reducing, while land and other inputs are risk increasing for both contract and independent farmers. Finally, independent growers consistently over-predict output prices.

N2  - Contract farming (CF) is always and inherently a gendered process. This paper unveils the gender dynamics in resource access, use and labour control to show how outgrower CF induces changes, often contradictory engendering processes of production relations. It asks: How does CF influence gender relations in access to land, household labour relations and employment conditions (participation)? Relying on a detailed case study research of a sugarcane CF scheme in Malawi, we show that CF has a complex gendered impact on household's production relations. CF leads to a masculinization of farm management and ownership together with a feminization of labour. Nevertheless, women translate such labour provision into active participation in decision-making over the use of the cash returns from the CF for better outcome in the household. At the individual level, some can benefit from it; especially women who manage to engage in cane farming are able to attain financial independence and increase their bargaining power within their households. However, such benefits are reserved for households with access to land. Nevertheless, women engagement in cane farming coupled with increased gender awareness through NGOs sensitization is contributing to a change in gendered social perceptions and increased valuation of women abilities in commercial farming, their needs and contributions and may be modifying the gender balance at the community level. We demonstrate that empowering women by making them cane farmers alone is not enough to change women position within their communities, unless community members accompany such empowerment with the recognition and acknowledgement of the women's contribution. The finding suggests that combining active women participation in outgrower CF with authority enhancing programs through community education whilst creating the possibilities for women to take independent action may be a good way to improve the gender relations between men and women.

N2  - The need for food systems to generate sustainable and equitable benefits for all is a global imperative. However, whilst ample evidence exists linking smallholder farmer coordination and aggregation (i.e. the collective transport and marketing of produce on behalf of multiple farmers) to improved market participation and farmer incomes, the extent to which interventions that aim to improve farmer market engagement may co-develop equitable consumer benefits remains uncertain. This challenge is pertinent to the horticultural systems of South Asia, where the increasing purchasing power of urban consumers, lengthening urban catchments, underdeveloped rural infrastructures and inadequate local demands combine to undermine the delivery of fresh fruits and vegetables to smaller, often rural or semi-rural markets serving nutritionally insecure populations. To this end, we investigate the potential for aggregation to be developed to increase fruit and vegetable delivery to these neglected smaller markets, whilst simultaneously improving farmer returns. Using an innovative system dynamics modelling approach based on an aggregation scheme in Bihar, India, we identify potential trade-offs between outcomes relating to farmers and consumers in smaller local markets. We find that changes to aggregation alone (i.e. scaling-up participation; subsidising small market transportation; mandating quotas for smaller markets) are unable to achieve significant improvements in smaller market delivery without risking reduced farmer participation in aggregation. Contrastingly, combining aggregation with the introduction of market-based cold storage and measures that boost demand improves fruit and vegetable availability significantly in smaller markets, whilst avoiding farmer-facing trade-offs. Critically, our study emphasises the benefits that may be attained from combining multiple nutrition-sensitive market interventions, and stresses the need for policies that narrow the fruit and vegetable cold storage deficits that exist away from more lucrative markets in developing countries. The future pathways and policy options discovered work towards making win-win futures for farmers and disadvantaged consumers a reality.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of access to production credit on the productivity of smallholder farmers. Design/methodology/approach: Data for the study were drawn from the Agricultural Value Chain Facility (AVCF), which was implemented in the Northern Region of Ghana. This paper uses the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to estimate the average treatment effect of access to production credit on the productivity of smallholder farmers. The rationale for the choice of this estimation technique is to control for selection bias since the treatment variable (access to production credit) was not randomised. The authors also test for the effect of hidden bias using "Rosenbaum bounds" sensitivity analysis. The study uses two control groups to examine the net effect of credit on productivity. Findings: The results reveal that smallholder farmers with access to production credit increased productivity through investment in farm inputs. For the impact of credit on productivity using control Group 1, the result shows that farmers with access to credit increased their productivity by 0.170 metric tonnes per hectare and for control Group 2, the result shows an increase of 0.252 metric tonnes per hectare more than farmers who are without access to production credit.

N2  - A century ago, Alfred Marshall demonstrated the inefficiency associated with farmers receiving only a portion of their marginal product. Farmers will supply less labor than under arrangements in which they receive their marginal product; output will be sub-optimal. Explanations of sharecropping are based on market imperfections, e.g., high transactions costs or inability to insure against risk, suggesting that sharecropping should disappear with economic development. Nevertheless, sharecropping survives. In Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, sharecropping has no legal status but farm surveys provide evidence of its existence. Despite farmers' awareness of the Marshallian paradox, institutional uncertainty contributes to the persistent attractiveness of sharecropping.

N2  - Policymakers in Southern Africa have long viewed agricultural cooperatives as a way to reach rural households more easily, but because not all rural households can afford to join cooperatives, this raises questions about membership inclusivity and whether cooperatives advantage some smallholders over others. Agricultural cooperatives can serve as an institutional vehicle for policymakers to deliver direct benefits to smallholder farmers in the form of subsidized agricultural inputs, usually improved seed varieties and fertilizers. They can also serve as platforms for collective action through which smallholders can reduce transportation and transaction costs or disperse the costs of marketing. In Zambia farmers are required to join a cooperative to qualify for seed and fertilizer support through the national Farmer Input Support Program (FISP), which is a structural incentive for cooperative membership and makes it complicated to determine if cooperative membership increases use of inputs and yields on its own. Using the Inverse Probability Weight Regression Adjustment (IPWRA) technique, we find Zambian smallholders participating in cooperatives achieve significantly higher maize yields and use significantly more hybrid-maize seed and fertilizers, even when controlling for FISP eligibility. Furthermore, across all selected productivity and input variables we find greater average treatment effects from cooperative membership than FISP participation. Cooperative membership is also associated with more assets, more land, and higher maize yields, which suggests that the poorest rural households are often not cooperative members. Cooperatives can be a powerful poverty policy tool to deliver direct benefits to small farmers, but not including the poorest households likely widens the rural poverty gap, both in terms of limited direct benefits of input support programs and in terms of farmers missing out on cooperative-specific benefits.

N2  - Purpose: Rapid transformation of agrifood value chains because of population growth, urbanization, rising consumer incomes and increased demand for food quality and safety has resulted in the need for smallholder farmers to coordinate horizontally through group formation and collective marketing to improve farm performance in developing countries. This paper aims to examine the factors that influence farmer group membership and collective marketing decisions and their impacts on smallholder farm performance in rural Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from a recent survey of 447 rice farmers in rural Ghana, an endogenous switching regression model is employed to account for selection bias arising from both observable and unobservable farmer attributes. Findings: The data reveal that group members and collective marketing participants obtained higher prices and also incurred lower input costs. The econometric estimates show that age, access to credit, mobile phone ownership, distance to market and road status are the main drivers of group membership and collective marketing decisions. The authors also find positive and significant impacts of farmer group membership and collective marketing on farm net revenues.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of GLOBALGAP standards certification on farmer's preference for marketing contract choices including written contracts, oral contracts and spot contracts, as well as to establish the impact of marketing contracts on net returns from snap bean production in Kenya. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, we use a data collected from 446 Snap bean farmers in Kenya. Using a two-step selection Bourguignon Frontier and Gurgand (BFG) model and Propensity Score Matching (PSM), we analysed determinants of Global Gap Certification and other farming characteristics that influence smallholder farmers preference for marketing contracts and net returns from snap beans venture. Findings: Results indicate that attending GLOBALGAP training, GLOBALGAP subsidy support, membership to GLOBALGAP farmer's groups, and selling beans to GLOBALGAP certified GLOBALGAP buyers would significantly influence better returns underwritten marketing contracts. Producing snap beans underwritten marketing contracts would get farmer's net returns of between 1.8 and 8% while producing under oral and spot market contracts would earn farmer net returns of between 0.2 and 0.08 %.

N2  - Purpose: Even though many studies identify positive effects of contract farming (CF) on the livelihood of farmers, the use of CF as a tool to increase farm performance is unsettled debate. Information on CF is relatively not available in staple food chains. Theoretical considerations have shown that there are challenges in employing CF in staple food chains such as rice. With the increasing trend of rice CF in Ghana, it is very critical to establish its performance in rice production in Ghana. It is therefore imperative to analyse the impact of CF on the performance of smallholder rice farmers. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted where 350 rice farmers selected through a stratified sampling technique using structured questionnaires were interviewed. Descriptive and inferential statistics including stochastic frontier analyses and endogenous treatment effect regression were used to analyse the data. Findings: The results from the endogenous treatment effect regression model show that CF improves rice farmers' technical, allocative and economic efficiencies by 21, 23 and 26 percent, respectively. Farm size and CF were identified as common factors influencing technical, allocative and economic efficiency measures of the farmers positively. It further identified age of farmer, educational level and household labour as factors influencing farmers' participation in CF positively.

N2  - Purpose: Commercialization of cassava is increasing because of increased urban demand for processed products and increased recognition of the industrial potential of the crop. This study aims to examine the cassava value chain in Ghana and its implications for upgrading. Design/methodology/approach: A combination of purposive, simple random and snowball sampling methods was adopted to select key actors in the cassava value chain. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data. Analysis of the data was largely descriptive, except for profitability of cassava production in selected regions, which was examined by employing gross and net marketing margin analysis. A comprehensive value chain map was generated to show the different product pathways for cassava from the farm gate to the final consumer, and roles of key value chain actors and their relationships were summarized through simple narrations. Findings: Evidence has shown chains of more than four different channels through which fresh cassava roots move from the farm gate to final consumers. Production of cassava in Ghana is profitable, generating positive net marketing margins across major producing centres. Processing of cassava has both dry and wet/fresh value chains depending on the derived products for the final consumer. There is weak governance system in the cassava value chain in Ghana as majority of actors use spot market transactions in dealing with trading partners. The use of standardized grading and weighing system is very limited in the chain, and limited access to credit is a critical constraint to value chain upgrading.

N2  - Tomatoes increase nutritional food security and income among Ugandan smallholder farmers who have limited access to high quality seed. The objective of this study was to analyze the current tomato seed value chain for Uganda. Survey responses determined roles of key participants, including Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) for regulation and certification; National Agricultural Research Organization for breeding cultivars and seed multiplication; Makerere University for education and research; commercial seed companies for seed importation and conditioning; seed distributors for sales; and smallholder farmers as savers and end users of seed. Challenges included an inefficient domestic seed distribution system, technical constraints in seed production and conditioning by seed companies, inadequate networks and communication among the seed industry's key participants, and partial regulation of the seed industry. Seed companies played a key role in seed conditioning processes. Companies imported all tomato seeds into Uganda and stated germination as their primary goal for quality. Challenges for seed companies included assistance from MAAIF to regulate and certify seed and access to improved technologies. Attaining high quality seed by commercial Uganda-parent companies will require additional investment and training of seed technologists for domestic testing and seed quality assurance.

N2  - Agriculture is the prime source of economic activities, especially in Asia. In the okra export market channels, Japan was a major importer, yet suspended all importation of okra from Thailand, according to the promulgation of the Positive List System. This study aimed to: 1) estimate one particular type of productive efficiency, viz. technical efficiency, in okra production in Thailand's Suphan Buri and Nakhon Pathom Provinces, by using a Cobb-Douglas production function for single okra output and multiple inputs. The analysis applied the Stochastic Production Frontier; 2) investigate the determinants of production efficiency by using Tobit regression. Based on data collected from 222 okra farming households in two provinces, who contracted with private companies to produce okra for export. The results revealed that the average technical efficiency of okra production among the samples in Suphan Buri and Nakhon Pathom Provinces was 81.45%. Furthermore, the results showed that okra growers' gender, age, formal years of schooling, number of family members engaged in okra production, and hired labour had positive relationships with efficiency scores. While years of experience in okra production had a negative effect.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate borrowing motivation, credit access barriers and their impacts on income of smallholder farmers engaging in cinnamon value chain development in Northwestern Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach: A multistage sampling technique using a structural questionnaire and in-depth interviews was applied for collecting primary data from farmers and relevant stakeholders. The Propensity Score Matching was employed to analyze access barriers and examine whether relaxing these barriers can improve farmer income. To deal with the issue of model uncertainty and further increase the robustness of results, Bayesian model average and the bootstrapping approach were applied. Findings: To fulfill the certain quality standards of cinnamon products which are later used in the medicinal and food industry, farmers as primary producers need credit for intensive investment to increase the value of their products. Still, there are 25.36 percent of farmers who have access constraints to formal credit. In the credit received group, 24.56 percent have not received full credit as demanded. Access problems are relevant to lack of collateral, lack of bank account holdings, inconvenient access to roads, weak chain linkage and limited organic farming. Removing credit access barriers can improve the income for farmers from cinnamon farming activities.

N2  - Women's participation in large-scale mining (LSM) has been increasing in Mexico and worldwide; however, few comprehensive studies exist on the socioeconomic effects of mining on women depending on the specific roles they play in this activity. The objective of this study was to analyze, from a feminist political ecology perspective, the effects of mining on women in a rural community in Sonora State, in arid northwest Mexico, a region with important participation of LSM in the country. For this purpose, we developed a mixed methods approach combining literature review on gender and LSM, semistructured in-depth interviews, and analysis of secondary government data. Most literature on women and mining treats them conceptually as a homogeneous social group or focuses on only one role women play in mining. We address this gap by identifying several roles women can play in their interactions with the mining sector and then analyzing and comparing the effects of mining associated with these distinctive roles. In doing so, we unravel the gendered complexities of mining and highlight the socioecological contradictions embedded in these dynamics for individual women who are faced with significant trade-offs. Mining can provide economic and professional opportunities for women of varying educational and socioeconomic levels in otherwise impoverished and landless rural households. At the same time, women are unable to, as one interviewee phrased it, "break the glass ceiling even if using a miner's helmet," especially in managerial positions. Extraction of natural resources in the community is accompanied by the extraction of social capital and personal lives of miners. We give voice to the social-ecological contradictions lived by women in these multiple roles and offer potential insights both for addressing gender-based inequities in mining and for avenues toward collective action and empowerment.

T1  - Understanding Drivers of Private-Sector Compliance to Large-Scale Food Fortification: A Case Study on Edible Oil Value Chains in Bangladesh

N2  - Micronutrient deficiency is a pertinent global challenge that affects billions of people and has deleterious health effects. Large-scale food fortification (LSFF) is a cost-effective way to tackle micronutrient deficiency and improve health outcomes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the success of LSFF in LMICs is often hampered by limited compliance with fortification mandates by the private sector, who supply fortified foods. In this paper, we use a case study of the edible oil produced in Bangladesh to analyze the factors facilitating and impeding this compliance by for-profit actors. We identified four bottlenecks that disincentivize private sector actors' decision to comply. First, fortified and non-fortified products co-exist in the market, disincentivizing producers to invest in fortification. Second, the lack of traceability reduces the risk for large-scale producers' non-compliance with the regulation. Third, small-scale producers face economic pressures that prevent them from adequately fortifying oil products. Lastly, law enforcement is currently inconsistent, allowing the supply of under-fortified oil in the market. Given the evidence, we recommend to strengthen the control of bulk item fortification through more frequent and rigorous surveillance at the production level. This will ensure that resource constrained consumers who also have the greatest potential to benefit from added nutrients, remain able to access affordable and nutrient-enriched food.

N2  - Sustainable Development Goals have brought optimism around 'agriculture for development' but also questioned agribusinesses in sustainable development. This paper assesses how an agribusiness' power exploits domains to exert control over industry governance. Using interviews and group discussions from three smallholder outgrower schemes under Illovo Sugar Plc in Zambia, the paper demonstrates that corporations can deploy the 'power of presence' to influence national policy development, and sustainability in regional and local practices. Investment and trade policies currently foster agribusinesses but overlook environmental assessments that expose social and ecological contradictions such as on competing water uses. State-donor relations enable smallholder integration in sugarcane as poverty reduction whilst agribusinesses are limiting their participation through controls on resources and production systems. By analysing power expressions, we show how possibilities of sustainable agriculture and rural development are undermined by agribusiness practices. We suggest that current policy efforts around 'agriculture for development' in Zambia are about entrenching power and interests of an agribusiness, neglecting industry expansion and sustainability. The paper highlights the limits and importance of domestic institutions in framing large-scale agricultural investments as well as mediating corporate practices that will be required to provide a greater focus on national planning processes for sustainable agriculture and rural development.

N2  - That numerous rural laborers migrate to urban areas to find off-farm jobs has become an outstanding economic phenomenon in China. To examine the impact of rural labor off-farm employment on household forest management, we built binary logistic models and Tobit models by applying a sample survey data of 500 households in rural Jiangxi in 2018. Households' participation and investment in forest management were measured by their labor and cash input. The results indicated that more off-farm laborers in household would hold back their participation in cash input. In contrast, a higher rate of female off-farm employment encouraged household monetary input. And households with more female agricultural laborers were more likely to participate in labor input. Neither off-farm employment nor female off-farm employment significantly influences households' labor input. Off-farm employment of the householder negatively influenced labor and cash input. Policy factors, such as obtaining forestry subsidies and forestry loans, joining forestry co-operative organizations, and better attitude to the logging quota system, also promoted households' participation and investment in forest management. Household head's age and education, forestry land status also affected participation in forest management. Our analysis could provide basis for managers to formulate policies to support sustainable forest management. Recommendations for Resource Managers: The econometric models applied in this research could reflect the influence of rural labor off-farm employment on household forest management behavior and provide a quantitative basis for formulating forest management policies. There were great differences between rural households' forest management cash input behavior and labor input behavior and households were more active in labor input compared with cash input. The gender structure of rural labor off-farm employment could impact households' forest management participation and investment. To achieve sustainable forest management, managers should pay attention to enhancing female forestry technique training and encouraging forest land transfer and consolidation in the collective forest regions of China.

N2  - China's small-scale agricultural producers face many challenges to increasing productivity and efficiency. In recent years, the Chinese government has provided support for farmer professional cooperatives (FPCs) to connect small farms with upstream and downstream processes in the food supply chain. This study combines propensity score matching and sample selection-corrected stochastic production frontier analysis to estimate the impacts of FPC participation by greenhouse vegetable producers on technical efficiency and income. Results indicate that FPCs help participants improve returns to scale and marginal returns to land and labor, increase technical efficiency, and obtain 4,460 yuan (18%) greater income per greenhouse than nonparticipants.

N2  - The long-held redistributive function of agricultural cooperatives--one of moral economy and poverty alleviation--has changed dramatically as they emerge as core brokers for agro-industrial development in the so-called 'green economy'. This article examines the changing role of cooperatives involved in brokering oil palm production and its impact upon the food security and livelihoods of smallholders who labour in plantation regimes situated in historically uneven agrarian political economies. Findings show how, increasingly, cooperatives reinforce uneven agrarian social relations of production and exchange in which indigenous smallholders experience loss of land, poor wage labour conditions tinged with insecurity and prejudice, and mounting debt in an expanding oil palm complex. The article suggests that these changes in agrarian social relations negatively influence indigenous farmers' food security pathways, with their access to and use of appropriate foods diminishing. It asserts that understanding the impacts of cooperatives on food security pathways requires a relational and situated analysis of livelihood change and agrarian relations in extractive frontiers.

N2  - This article assesses impacts of the Jepara Furniture Value Chain (FVC) project, which was intended to address challenges faced by small-scale furniture producers in Jepara, Indonesia. The assessment focuses on the effects of membership in the Jepara Small-Scale Furniture Producers Association (APKJ), a body started as part of the FVC project. Propensity score matching was used to compare differences in outcome variables between association members and matched non-members. A limited, positive impact of APKJ membership was found. Members improved their marketing, allowing them to retain more value than non-members. APKJ members were also more likely to have obtained certificates of timber legality. However, APKJ membership did not significantly affect firm profit and there was little evidence of an industry transformation. The paper also critiques the indiscriminate use of a value chain approach.

N2  - This study attempts to uncover the truth behind an increasing number of smallholder farmers participating in sustainable coffee farming in Vietnam. Using stochastic frontier and cost-benefit analysis, a sample of 316 smallholder farmers in Dak Lak was chosen to analyze the economic impacts of sustainable and conventional coffee farming on farmers' welfare. In addition, we conducted field observation and key informant interviews to describe several farming practices. The results highlight the fact that farmers' decisions to participate in sustainable coffee farming are mainly driven by economic benefits. Sustainable farming is more cost-effective and profitable than conventional farming, despite the insignificant difference in production efficiency. Improvement of education, farming knowledge, and collective actions could mitigate negative effects of small-scale production for sustainable coffee farmers. Pesticide management, shade coffee encouragement, and reduction of excessive fertilization, over-irrigation, and unproductive coffee varieties are recommended for sustainable development of the sector.

N2  - The purpose of the article is to determine the directions of integration processes in the development of entrepreneurial activity in the agricultural sector of the economy. Research methods: Using statistical and graphical methods, the state and trends of integration transformations of agricultural enterprises in Ukraine were assessed. Research results: The dynamics of changes in the number of agricultural enterprises in Ukraine during 2013-2019, their structure on the basis of legal status, scope and results of activities are analyzed and the relevant conclusions on the ways of development of integration processes in the agricultural sector are formed. The functioning of agrarian business entities of different sizes has been studied. The integration potential of small business entities in the agricultural sector has been identified. The dynamics of the main production indicators of small and micro enterprises is given, their share in the total volume of agricultural production is determined. Also, small forms of management due to integration and cooperative processes provide an opportunity to develop in rural areas, making financial contributions to local budgets, while large enterprises (agricultural holdings) usually have minimal impact on the development of rural economy and rural areas. The main segments of agricultural production (such as potatoes, vegetables, fruits and berries) in which households play a key role are identified. Priority areas for the development of personal farms have been identified, in particular, through the creation of family farms and their association in cooperatives, etc. The information base of the study is the scientific achievements of leading domestic and foreign scientists, analytical data of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine. On the basis of the obtained results the social and economic expediency of development of cooperative forms of management in the countryside and integration of small-scale agricultural producers is substantiated. Scientific novelty: It is proposed to turn personal peasant farms into family farms as components of integration formations in agrarian business. Practical significance: The state of business structures of the agricultural sector of the Ukrainian economy is assessed and the prospects and advantages of the development of integration formations and cooperation in the sustainable development of rural areas are outlined.

N2  - Inclusive businesses are complex partnerships between commercial entities and smallholders/low-income communities, to include the latter in commercial agricultural value chains. IBs offer income opportunities for both partners, but are also regarded as empowering the smallholders/communities. To date, IB inclusiveness has been assessed mainly through basic quantitative measurements. However, these measures neglect the complexities of the overall value creation process, and of the inclusion of the beneficiaries within this process. This paper aims at providing a more holistic methodology by assessing the level of inclusiveness based on four dimensions: ownership, voice, risk and reward. Case studies in South Africa show that inclusion of low-income communities lags behind the intended level. Lack of financial resources and skills, reinforced by power imbalance, result in smallholder ownership being limited to land, the community's voice being compromised, risk being transferred to the smallholder communities and rewards being disappointing for the beneficiaries.

N2  - Agricultural incentive policies affects not only agricultural production, but also land rental price. This paper extends the theoretical framework of the effect of agricultural incentive policies on land rental prices by simultaneously considering agricultural tax, agricultural subsidy and output price support policies and methods to implement these policies. The empirical analyses are based on a unique dataset from several rounds of representative rural household surveys that recorded the land rental prices of 7122 plots in 276 villages across 11 provinces during 1999-2018 in China. The survey results show that land rental price had increased significantly until the middle 2010s and then started to fall thereafter. Eliminating agricultural tax based on cultivated land and implementing price support policy through government procurement program have significantly raised land rental price, but the effect of agricultural subsidy to contract holder/owner on land rental price is insignificant. While the econometric results are consistent with the theoretical expectations, this study provides strong empirical evidence that the recipient of subsidy (owner or operator/tenant) matters, and finds the impacts of agricultural subsidy and output price support policies on land rental price in China differ significantly from the previous findings in developed countries due to different ways to implement subsidy and price support policies. The paper concludes with policy implications.

N2  - Major changes are taking place in the Chinese countryside. Long a smallholder dominant economy with small and fragmented farms, a suite of policies, regulations, and financial instruments are being mobilised to drive larger-scale, more commercialised, and more industrialised farming in China. Larger operators such as "dragon-head" agribusinesses are transforming production and supply chains, while the operational rights and titles over farmland are being formalised so that smallholders can more easily transfer their land to large-scale producers. This article aims to deepen our understanding of the extent and nature of land transfer in China by exploring its dynamics in inland provinces. It draws on a 2019 survey of more than 900 cash-cropping farms in four provinces (Hebei, Shaanxi, Hubei and Yunnan), semi-structured interviews, and secondary data. Our mixed methods approach supports in-depth analysis of the extent and dynamics of land transfer in apple, tea, orange and coffee-growing areas. We find that in contrast to national statistics, land transfer from smallholders to other operators is generally quite limited, a finding which highlights the ongoing viability of specialised smallholder farming and other site-specific barriers to scaling up. In the site where land transfer is most extensive, it is being driven by a state-agribusiness-cooperative alliance rather than through a newly emerged rural land market. We also find that the nature of leasing out farmland is markedly different to leasing in farmland. Where it occurs, the leasing out of land tends to be organised and formalised, and is tied to state developmentalist goals, particularly poverty alleviation. The leasing in of land is more widespread and occurs on an informal basis. Our analysis highlights key conditions that determine uneven land transfer and confirms that local political-economic dynamics complicate the realisation of central government directives on the ground.

N2  - In Ethiopia, there is a renewed interest in agricultural cooperatives as an institutional tool to improve the welfare of smallholder farmers. One of the pathways through which cooperatives benefit their members is scale economies. However, the establishment of cooperatives in Ethiopia seems to pay little attention to the size of the organizations. This article aims at investigating the effect of size on cost efficiency of agricultural cooperatives. More specifically, the purpose is to examine whether a single cooperative can serve a given number of farmers at a lower cost than two or more smaller cooperatives could. We employ the concept of cost subadditivity to compare the cost efficiency of large versus small cooperatives, and by extension unilateral actions. We estimate a flexible production technology using cross-sectional cooperative-level data. Findings show that costs would drop by 78% to 181% if farmers join hands in relatively large rather than small cooperatives.

N2  - The introduction of EU mandates for biofuel use in the transport sector initially led to high expectations that African countries would benefit from biofuel exports to the EU. This market opportunity has not been realised, however, due to regulatory requirements for the production of biofuels that act as non-tariff barriers to the acceptance of African biofuels in the EU. This benefits producers of biofuel crops and processors in the EU by providing economic protection. In particular, the EU import regime fails to acknowledge the challenges faced by African (or other) developing countries in satisfying the requirements. Using a computable general equilibrium model for Malawi, we quantify the foregone potential benefits from biofuel production for exports to the EU arising from non-tariff barriers (NTBs) embedded in the sustainability criteria. Our results show that sugarcane-ethanol production under smallholder outgrower regimes would lead to both economic growth outcomes and rural development, whereas jatropha-biodiesel fails to increase rural incomes due to low profitability. While there is widespread agreement on the latter today, our study is the first to explore the failure of jatropha in Malawi in an economy-wide framework. The ethanol results, however, also hold if land clearing is forbidden, thereby preserving biodiversity as stipulated under the sustainability criteria in the EU Renewable Energy Directive. The EU NTBs embedded in the Renewable Energy Directive thus play a much larger role for countries in Sub-Sahara Africa than simply inhibiting investment opportunities and should be refashioned to lower the entry costs for developing countries.

N2  - Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and governments are promoting cooperatives as key to linking smallholder farmers with modern markets to achieve inclusive development, yet the specifics of these supply relationships remain poorly understood. This article uses data from 51 interviews with supply chain stakeholders and a survey of 110 smallholder vegetable farmers in Nicaragua to investigate the impact of cooperative-supermarket supply chain relationships on cooperatives, and the role retailers and NGOs play in facilitating these relationships. The study found that in Nicaragua, cooperatives selling to Walmart became unstable, in contrast with the performance of cooperatives selling to local supermarket chain La Colonia. The results show that cooperative performance is impacted by an interaction between differences in the types of farmers reached by the two supermarket chains, in the performance of the NGOs involved in each supply chain, and in the supermarkets' business practices. The findings suggest that NGOs should pay more attention to buyer sourcing strategies and farmer needs when designing development interventions to link cooperatives of resource-poor farmers to markets, so as not to increase the vulnerability of smallholder farmers.

N2  - The rapid expansion of food supply chains across Africa has created huge market opportunities for farmers. In particular, the rise of numerous enterprises engaged in food processing and trading in the 'midstream' of value chains is promising. Compared to large enterprises using formal contracts, midstream enterprises not using contracts are considered more accessible to small-scale farmers. However, the extent to which economic benefits of the recent expansion of these non-contract opportunities in Africa is inclusive of smallholder farmers is uncertain and largely unexplored. This is critical for the global debate on poverty and sustainable economic development as the share of agricultural land under smallholder farmers, who constitute a significant proportion of the world's poor is still rising. This paper contributes to this thin literature with evidence from Zambia, where a growing demand for meat has stimulated growth of the soybean industry. We use nationally-representative panel survey data from Zambia to explore the welfare effects of smallholder engagement with soybean traders and processors in non-contractual arrangements. The analysis uses fixed effects and instrumental variables estimation techniques to address the endogeneity of the smallholder decision to sell to large-scale traders and processors. We find significant positive crop income effects of selling to soybean large-scale traders and processors on all smallholders. However, the observed effects only translate into higher total household incomes and poverty reduction for medium-scale smallholders (operating 5 ha- 20 ha) but not for small-scale smallholders operating less than five hectares. The positive crop income effects are mainly driven by the opportunity to sell more although small-scale smallholders receive a price premium from selling to large buyers. These results suggest that the recent expansion of the soybean industry in Zambia is benefiting smallholder farmers but not necessarily enough to move the smallest of these farmers out of poverty.

N2  - We apply a value chain approach to examine how blackberry producers in Ecuador can improve production and marketing practices to obtain more favorable prices. Results show that general upgrading actions are associated with improved producer prices, and specific activities, such as seeking information from reputable sources can lead to substantial welfare improvements. The paper goes beyond most value chain studies which treat participation in a 'modern' value chain as a discrete state. Ecuador's blackberry industry is evolving incrementally with no clearly discernible 'modern' market chains. Instead, producers incrementally make improvements in multiple dimensions. Relatively low-cost practices, many of which do not imply substantial risk or investment, are associated with price improvements. Obstacles to participation in incremental value chain upgrading activities are not insurmountable. In particular, scale of production is not a limiting factor: small-scale producers are not precluded from adopting improved practices and they do not suffer in terms of price received.

N2  - The global demand for cashew nuts continues to increase steadily. However, many African countries face difficulties in marketing and adding value to the product. Using recent survey data of 391 cashew farmers in Ghana, this paper contributes to the growing evidence on the significance of contract farming (CF) in improving the welfare of rural households in developing countries. Specifically, the paper analyzes the factors that influence cashew farmers' decisions to participate in CF, and the impact of participation on farmers' performance. We employ a recently developed switching regression model with endogenous explanatory variables and endogenous switching to control for selection bias caused by observable and unobservable factors. The empirical results show that participation in CF significantly increases labor productivity and price margins, as well as cashew yields, and net revenues. A disaggregated analysis of the sample into farm size categories reveals that small-sized cashew farms tend to benefit more through CF, compared to medium- and large-sized farms.

N2  - This paper develops a farm household model of heterogeneous Malaysian rice farmers. The model determines the domestic price of milled rice in equilibrium. The model is simulated to analyze the effects of free trade, self-sufficiency achieved through trade policy, and the impact of free trade and self-sufficiency when rice productivity expands. The ex ante results for free trade predict that total rice supply rises as the increase in imports offsets the decrease in domestic production, causing the domestic price of milled rice to fall by 15.8 percent. While this price decrease generates negative income effects for rice farmers, it leads to an expansion of consumption of milled rice by both the farm and urban populations. The results for self-sufficiency through heightened tariffs predict that production for domestic rice farmers increases. However, with fewer imports, total rice supply falls, causing the domestic price of rice to increase by 41.5 percent. Because free trade is politically unfeasible and trade-driven self-sufficiency policies contract total rice consumption, boosting rice production through research and development is an effective way for Malaysia to increase the total supply of rice while limiting its dependence on imports.

N2  - The introduction of direct subsidies to farming households and the development of farmer cooperatives has provided two important approaches to China's twenty-first century food policy challenges. However, research undertaken largely separates and focuses on subsidies or cooperatives. This neglects their interaction and complementarities. This article seeks to rectify this omission using a survey from 35 farmer specialized cooperatives (FSCs) and 561 farming households in 16 provinces, based on a two-stage treatment effect model. The findings suggest FSCs have become important organizations that improve farmers' net income. Moreover, usage of agricultural machinery and direct subsidies also result in higher net income, though they have little impact on farmers' machinery investment. The results provide an evidence source that contributes to debate concerning government subsidy policy. Policy may act more like an income transfer program, since it has little impact on farmers' investment in agriculture. The study also highlights that there are complementary effects between FSCs and direct subsidies, and that China's cooperative policy integrated with direct subsidies could be progressive.

N2  - Indemnifying smallholder farmers against crop loss is thought to play an important role in encouraging the adoption of new technologies and facilitating productivity growth, but to be infeasible due to information problems. Consequently there is interest in developing alternative, partial, insurance products. Examples include rainfall insurance and the limited liability inherent in credit contracts. I argue that although these products may reduce information asymmetry, ambiguity averse farmers struggle to assess whether the contracts reduce risk. This problem is most pronounced when the production technology is ambiguous, as is likely the case for new technologies. I formalize this argument and test the theory using data from two RCTs, conducted in Malawi and Kenya. Comparative statics from the theory are consistent with both sets of data, and I argue that income losses from ambiguity aversion may be substantial.

N2  - This paper analyses the implications of contract farming for gender inequalities in rural Mozambique. Contract farming is often considered one of the major tools of agribusiness development. It broadly includes those arrangements under which producers commit to providing cash crop to a buyer firm. This paper exploits a panel dataset (2002-2005) collected by the Mozambican Ministry of Agriculture among a nationally representative sample of rural households to explore contracts' implications for gender equality both across and within households. We look at both the participation of female-headed households in contracts and the impact of establishing a contract on a set of intra-household women empowerment indicators. Concerning the first, our results confirm a (small though significant) effect of selection out of contracts of households where a woman is the household's head. With regard to the second, we expect contrasting effects to be at work: on the one hand, increased income may relax budget constraints improving women's living conditions, and on the other, we may expect a shift in favour of men of the control over the household's assets. We find different results according to the indicator used; after controlling for selection bias, we find no effect on control over land but a negative effect on women's access to extension services.

N2  - Foreign direct investment (FDI) facilitates modernization of domestic agri-food systems in emerging economies through increased use of vertical coordination. This paper sheds lights on how international brewer investments in African food systems affect smallholder market participation and value chain development. In particular, we analyze the impact of contracts among malt barley producers in Ethiopia. Using cross-sectional survey data, we employ inverse probability-weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) and propensity score matching (PSM) techniques to analyze the economic impact of contracting. We find that contrary to popular belief, contracting has positive and significant impact on malt barley production, intensification, commercialization, quality improvement, and farm gate prices, ultimately resulting in increased net income and spillover into the productivity of other food crops.

N2  - This article reviews the literature on contract farming (CF) in India and assesses the impact of smallholders' perceived production risks on the adoption of CF; the impact of CF on smallholders' food security; and its impact on employment generation in their farming enterprises. We also show the impact of the outcome variables by risk preference of smallholders. Using farm-level data and endogenous switching regression methods, this study presents three key findings. First, the perception of weather and pest risk, access to irrigation facilities, extension visits, and access to institutional credit are the main drivers of CF adoption. Second, CF adoption increases food security and varies with the revealed risk preference of smallholders, and risk-seeking smallholders tend to gain higher food security. Third, regardless of revealed risk preferences, smallholders who did not adopt CF benefit from adoption by reducing their labor requirements, with no significant losses in yield.

N2  - The agriculture sector in Pakistan, as in most developing countries, is dominated by smallholder producers. Pakistan has the world's third largest dairy industry, and milk is efficiently collected and distributed chiefly by informal value chains that market the raw product with minimal cool chain infrastructure. Formal processors have a small market share of 5 percent. Interview data from farmers, milk collectors and consumers from three rural-urban case study value chains were analysed to study opportunities and challenges faced by the dairy industry. Compositional analysis of milk samples (n = 84) collected along these chains identified the fact that in Pakistan informal milk chains provide a cheaper source of calories for the final consumer than industrialised milk chains (USD 0.12 compared USD 0.15 per 100 calories). These three chains created an estimated 4,872 jobs from farm to market and provided access to interest-free credit for the farmers. The existing government price setting mechanism at the retail end and collusion by large processors to set farm gate prices provided significant limitations to the profitability of small-holder farms providing the product. The absence of quality and quantity standards, amid the exchange of huge numbers of small volumes of milk along these chains, are major impediments to industry growth.

N2  - This paper uses a semiparametric instrumental variable model to study the determinants of agricultural land transfer-out, using face-to-face survey data collected in 2014 from 2,677 farmers in nine provinces of China. Results show that variables, such as the number of parcels of land, the collective's total land transfer-out, and the availability of a transportation network, have significant linear positive effects on households' farmland transfer-out. Having family members with a lower educational level affect land transfer-out negatively. Landholding size and land idling have an inverted-U and L shaped impact, respectively, on land transfer-out. Results also indicate that agricultural income ratio has an overall negative influence on land transfer out. Land transfer-out has the potential to provide opportunities to earn additional income from the land, increase land productivity, and reduce poverty in rural China.

N2  - Index insurance has been heralded as a potential solution to risk management problems faced by smallholder farmers in developing countries. Despite its potential, demand for standalone index insurance contracts has remained low in early field trials. We investigate the willingness to pay for drought index insurance-backed loans in northern Ghana using contingent valuation. We find that index insurance lowers overall demand for agricultural loans. We also compare micro-level index insurance, provided directly to farmers, with meso-level insurance, provided to the credit agency and find that farmers appear to prefer micro-level insurance. Finally, farmers are willing to pay to avoid basis risk.

N2  - This study aims to measure the impact of the most influential pineapple producers' association, the Reseau des Producteurs d'Ananas du Benin (RePAB), on technical efficiency regarding pineapple production. With a randomized sample consisting of 135 pineapple producers, the results obtained using propensity score matching show that the advice offered to producers by RePAB increased technical efficiency of pineapple production by 11.2 percent in relation to the average observed technical efficiency of 66.7 percent. However, this impact could be enhanced if the services delivered were improved in order to reduce the exclusion from the system of small-scale producers with a low level of education, the largest category in the population.

N2  - Purpose: In societies with strong presence of Islam, Islamic instruments with more scope for fairness and equity can be innovatively harnessed to play an increasing role in the development process and poverty alleviation schemes. Poor smallholder farmers dominate agricultural production in many developing countries and contribute a significant portion of global food production. This paper aims to develop a scheme to improve poor smallholder farmers' vulnerable financial situation through the application of Zakah and Salam contract, using Bangladesh as a case study. Secondary goals are to show the effect of the scheme on food security and relevance to Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: The authors explore the existing traditional modes of financing available to poor smallholders, identify their challenges and propose an appropriate Islamic financing scheme. Findings: With the Zakah-based Salam forward contract, the proposed scheme would procure food through Institutional Demand to offer interest free financing, fair price and access to new marketing channels and reduce income uncertainty for the rural smallholders. The discussions indicate that the local food security will be enhanced through incentivized farming activities and disbursement of food from the food bank to the Zakah-eligible food insecure local people.

N2  - Cash crops such as specialty rice and other high-value varieties produced for domestic and international markets are considered an increasing source of income for smallholder farmers in many Asian countries. The present study focuses on the factors affecting Vietnamese specialty rice farmers' choice of marketing channel and how their choice influences farm performance. The analysis has been conducted using multinomial logit and linear regression models on quantitative data collected from 280 specialty rice farmers in the Red River Delta, one of the main rice production regions in Vietnam. Results reveal that even though local collectors and wholesalers are still the most common recipients of farmers' goods in rural areas, reduction in transaction costs with regard to uncertainty influences farmers to choose modern marketing channels through collective action (via specialty rice farmer associations). This collective marketing channel helps farmers increase average prices received by US$0.028 per kg of paddy. Based on the results, manifold political implications are derived.

N2  - We investigate production risk, technical efficiency and risk attitudes amongst contract and independent farmers. We use a Bayesian parametric approach and stochastic dominance quantile regression methods to compare technical efficiency and risk attitude of smallholders in Nepal. Using farm-level data, we find that contract farmers appear to show lower inefficiency and lower production risk. Additionally, contract and independent farmers can increase output by reducing the scale of operation. Regardless of the commodity produced and farming arrangement (contract or independent production), we find that labour, land and other inputs are risk-augmenting, while the role of capital is mixed. We find a second order stochastic dominance (SSD) for lentils, and first order stochastic dominance (FSD) for tomatoes, ginger and HYV paddy seed commodities. Finally, contract farmers are more risk averse than independent farmers, regardless of the commodity produced.

N2  - Women are important actors in smallholder farmer milk production. Therefore, female input in the dairy cooperatives is essential to dairy development in emerging economies. Within dairy value chains, however, their contributions are often not formally acknowledged or rewarded. This article contributes to filling this gap by adopting a multileveled institutional perspective to explore the case of dairy development in the Pangalengan mixed-sex dairy cooperative on West Java, Indonesia. The objective is to add evidence from the dairy development practice in Indonesia to the current agenda for gender and development as well as identify pathways for future research on dairy development that will help it do better in practice. Central to the exploration is a discussion of formal and informal institutions as part of the dynamics of the inequality regimes in dairy cooperatives. Evidence from dairy development practices in the Pangalengan cooperative shows, among others, distinct differences between the participation of male and female target groups in dairy development extension, as well as farm size- and resource-related trends in 'masculinization' and 'feminization' of the smallholder farmer household. The conclusions contribute to debates on more resilient, thus sustainable working relations in food chains, women's empowerment, gender equality and social justice in agriculture as well as cooperative studies.

N2  - Choice of a share vs. fixed rent land rental contract has figured prominently in the theory of industrial organization. This theory tells us that, while a share contract is inefficient in a first-best world, it may be the preferred option under second-best conditions. It has thus predicted the existence of sharecropping as the potentially preferred contract under conditions of liquidity constraint. Rigorous empirical evidence is, however, still lacking on this basic contribution of theory. We use a randomized experiment in a credit program for landless workers and marginal farmers organized by BRAC in Bangladesh to show that increased access to credit has a large positive effect on the choice of fixed rent over share rent contracts, both in terms of number of contracts and area contracted. As predicted by theory, the magnitude of this shift away from sharecropping is enhanced when the tenant is less exposed to risk. Development programs that facilitate access to credit to potential tenants can thus help them take more efficient land rental contracts.

N2  - Lentils, a low-value and highly nutritious crop, are Nepal's largest pulse cash crop. However, the majority of the nation's smallholders produce lentils on very small plots of land. The large gap in lentil yields between Nepal and other lentil-producing countries underscores the importance of improving yields and income of smallholders. When it comes to the financial viability of small farms, particularly in developing countries, and globalisation, contract farming (CF) may prove useful in achieving efficiency and profitability in smallholder lentil farms in Nepal. This study employs the propensity score matching approach to examine the effects of the adoption of CF on yields, profitability and costs of smallholder lentil farms in Nepal. Findings from this study reveal that contrary to popular belief, CF adoption by lentil producers in Nepal has a positive and significant effect on per-hectare revenues, profits and yield and a negative impact on variable and transportation costs. The study finds that only very smallholder lentil farms (0.01-0.05 ha) benefit from CF.

N2  - This study investigates the impact of contract farming (CF) through cooperatives in tomatoes on employment and economic performance of smallholders in a low-income developing country. Using farm-level data from Nepal and a nonparametric matching estimator, the study finds a negative and significant effect of CF on employment. However, CF through cooperatives has a positive and significant impact on profits, and yield. We find that small farms (<=0.51 ha) with contracts tend to gain in profits and yield per hectare. However, large farms (>0.85 ha) with contracts employ significantly less hired labor per hectare. Finally, our estimates reveal that, compared to independent producers, smallholder households in Nepal that engaged in CF with both input and output conditions received, on average, higher profits and yield. Findings underscore the importance of cooperatives and CF.

N2  - China's political and economic systems are often discussed in combination. It is generally believed that under the political system of centralization, the economic system had to be a state monopoly. This article challenges that view by providing an economic perspective. The period 1949-1984 is selected to explore the causes of successive periods of strengthening and weakening of the state's monopoly power over the economy. Scholars have generally assumed that the period of state monopoly originated from socialist ideology or the personal will of the leaders. But economic conditions severely limited the options available. After the new China was established, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) did not try to create a fully socialist economy in the short run. Instead, the CCP formulated a New Democracy platform that pragmatically allowed many types of enterprise to function side by side, including private industry, household ventures, and state-owned enterprises. The original plan of the CCP was to allow private enterprise to develop in order to build up capital to rebuild the war-damaged economy so that a strong foundation could be established for creating a socialist economy. But the Korean War from 1950 to 1953 and an influx of Soviet capital caused a shift from a mixed economy to state capitalism by 1956. From that point on, Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders had to change course again and again as fiscal crises limited available options. A reversal occurred in 1958 when the Soviets withdrew both their advisors and their capital subsidies, leaving the state capitalist system weakened. The crisis in the Chinese economy from 1959 to 1961 required decentralization of economic authority and efforts to promote rural capital formation. The next shift occurred after 1963 as the economy was organized to prepare for a possible military invasion. The required mobilization of industrial resources in remote regions of China inevitably reinforced state management of the economy. The final reversal occurred in the late 1970s, when imports of Western technology and equipment created another fiscal crisis for the central government, which then had to shift the burden of capital formation from the state to private entities. The reform of the rural household contract system, the adjustment of economic structures, and an increase in exports to gain foreign exchange all took place as part of "de-monopolization" reforms. The reforms that occurred after 1979 were not an aberration or a radical break from the past. They were part of a pattern that evolved from 1949 to 1984, with fluctuations dependent on the weakening and strengthening status of state finances. The shifts that occurred during this period have either been ignored by observers, or they have been misinterpreted as being motivated by ideology. In fact, new policies were created to enable the government to adjust to changes in the internal and external environment.

N2  - Information on private costs can improve the efficiency of programs that provide payment for environmental services in contexts involving information asymmetries and heterogeneous private costs. Using data from laboratory and field experiments, this paper presents and evaluates a novel private cost revealing mechanism, termed the random quantity mechanism (RQM), that can advance research in conservation contracting, payments for environmental services, and other similar settings. We examine the RQM's performance in a laboratory setting using induced costs and report results obtained from the first field implementation of this mechanism, with smallholder farmers in Zambia. We show that the RQM is incentive-compatible, that participant decision-making maximizes expected payoffs, and that the mechanism provides non-parametric estimates of private costs. The paper contributes to economic field studies by introducing a new incentive-compatible mechanism that elicits individuals' minimum willingness to accept across intensive margins, enabling researchers to estimate the supply of a service or commodity, and provides for exogenous variation in contract terms, which can aid in separately identifying the impacts of incentives and of participants' willingness to accept on contract outcomes.

N2  - One of the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 2 is to double agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers through, among other things, improving access to financial services including credit. However, designing appropriate mechanisms for increasing access to credit by poor households remains a challenge, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper argues that technology adoption and collective action could provide pathways to enhancing access to credit. Evidence from milk-producing households in Tanzania suggests that group membership increases the probability of borrowing and the amount of funds borrowed by households, while adoption of artificial insemination increases the amount of funds borrowed. Two major conclusions are that public policy for increasing rural households' access to credit should promote collective action, and that the likely increase in amount of funds demanded by households due to technology adoption and collective action will require policy to address issues pertaining to credit rationing of rural households.

N2  - Agricultural households face collective action dilemmas when making decisions about investments in their common household farm and the allocation of resources and benefits derived from it. We relate intrahousehold decisions, as measured in a lab-in-the-field experiment conducted with spouses in agricultural households in western Uganda, with actual investments and intrahousehold resource allocation. Intrahousehold decision-making that supports cooperation and equitable sharing is associated with greater investment in the intensification of cash and food crop production, and more equitable access and control over income. Freeriding behaviour by husbands is associated with the intensification of cash crop production, but not with equitable sharing.

N2  - Purpose: Using a recent rural farm household survey, the purpose of this paper is to investigate inclusiveness and effectiveness of agricultural cooperatives in Ethiopia. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a logit model to examine inclusiveness and an endogenous switching regression (ESR) model to evaluate the effectiveness of agricultural cooperatives. Findings: The results show that agricultural cooperatives are less inclusive of land-poor and illiterate households. On the other hand, the estimated results indicate that cooperatives effectively improved agricultural performance and welfare of its member households--i.e. membership in cooperatives increases yield and income by 1.37 quintal/hectare and 1,804 birr, respectively. Moreover, the result shows that marketing cooperatives effectively increased marketed surplus of their members by 34 percent.

N2  - Vegetable farming is the main source of livelihood for smallholder farmers in Eswatini. However, the production and marketing challenges they faced inhibits the farmers from benefiting fully, which calls for relational transactions to enhance exchange efficiency. Therefore, this study aims to determine the nature of relationship constructs between vegetable farmers selling to formal and informal channels. Data elicited from 170 farmers were analysed using factor analysis, multiple regression analysis and discriminant analysis. Results revealed that farmers derived satisfaction from the price offered and communication, while trust was derived from satisfaction, communication and duration of the relationship, and commitment was derived from trust in both channels. The discriminant analysis results revealed that there is statistical significant difference between the channels. Farmers supplying formal markets perceived levels of satisfaction, trust, and commitment better than those supplying informal markets. The results also indicated that satisfaction and trust were the best predictors of the nature of the relationships. The lack of written contracts and low produce quantity purchased by the formal markets contributes to the low-level establishment of the farmer-buyer relationships. Therefore, coordinated supply chains and supplier-development approaches are necessary to complement the logistical requirements associated with fresh produce and to create mutual benefits.

N2  - Food security and agricultural-led industrialisation are pivotal development objectives in Ethiopia. One of the main challenges this country faces is increasing agricultural productivity by integrating smallholder farmers into a high-value agricultural commodity supply chain. This paper examines an integrated project--the Agricultural Value Chains Project in Oromia (AVCPO)--that aims to improve the livelihoods of smallholders in the Bale Zone by involving them in the production of high-quality durum wheat and linking them to the pasta industry via farmers' cooperatives. Using primary data collected in 2014 and retrospective information, this paper investigates the AVCPO's effects on the quantity of cereal production, the share of cereals that have been sold through cooperatives, food security, and education. In order to account for potential violations of the exclusion restriction assumption, an instrumental variable approach is applied, together with three additional estimation strategies. The results suggest that the project has had a large and positive effect on gross and net values of cereal production per hectare, as well as on the share of production sold to pasta makers through cooperatives. These benefits accrue equally to land-rich and land-poor farmers. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the AVCPO has improved educational outcomes and reduced food insecurity, without affecting crop rotation practices. Overall, our findings point to the effectiveness of the project. Before replicating or scaling up this intervention, however, it is necessary to understand how to better involve poorer farmers and which adjustments are needed if the areas selected have a lower potential than Bale Zone.

N2  - The impact of commercial farms on smallholders in developing countries remains highly controversial. This study draws on four periods of investments in commercial farming in Mozambique to frame an empirical analysis of their contemporary economic spillovers. We investigate the degree of selection of commercial farms into more favourable locations as well as the extent of heterogeneity in the effects of different commercial farming models on proximate smallholders. The analysis uses survey data covering all large commercial farms in Mozambique and which are linked to a nationally-representative survey of 6000 smallholders. Contrary to widespread assumptions that investors target only marginal farm land, we find that commercial farms are highly selective in their locations, preferring areas close to existing infrastructure and markets. Controlling for selection bias via reweighting and fixed effects, we find the presence of a commercial farm is associated with moderately higher incomes among neighbouring smallholders but a lower incidence of wage employment. Furthermore, these effects vary according to the type of commercial farming in place. More inclusive commercial models, such as those associated with outgrower schemes, appear to generate larger benefits. We conclude that broad generalizations about commercial farming investments must be replaced by more nuanced discussions of alternative investment models.

N2  - Increasingly, food security interventions in developing economies are adapting value chain approaches to facilitate the integration of smallholders into high margin value chains. In Kenya, the resurgence of African Indigenous Vegetables due to their medicinal value and rich micronutrients is a case in point. The vegetables are cultivated by smallholders, and the supply has not matched the demand in the high margin markets among urban consumers. Access to such high margin markets necessitates that smallholders gain entry or upgrade into the networks of those buyers who possess considerable control of these value chains. There is limited value chain scholarship on chain governance and its implication for smallholder participation in Kenya. This study investigated how value chain governance influences farmer participation in vegetable markets and food security in Kenya. This study employed exploratory case study design to provide chain architecture, isolate primary actors, their roles, relations, constraints and opportunities for upgrading by smallholders. A mixed method approach involving a multistage sampling technique of 339 respondents was employed to bring to the surface insights on chain architecture, market margins and governance structures and their implications as regards upgrading trajectories for small-scale farmers in Kenya. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. Spot market relations were found to dominate traditional value chains in rural areas while peri-urban areas exhibited both traditional and coordinated value chains. The value chains are characterised by very weak linkages between upstream actors and downstream partners, where wholesalers and supermarkets play the role of leading firms in traditional and coordinated value chains, respectively. The study recommends the inclusion of farmers in market management committees and the establishment of binding contractual arrangements with supermarkets.

N2  - The repercussions of reforming an agricultural market are mainly observed at the most vulnerable segment of the value chain, namely, the producers. In the current commodity market created with trade through the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX), coffee is less traceable to its producers. Only cooperatives that sell certified coffee through the unions they belong to, are allowed to bypass the more commodified ECX market. This study aims to investigate if small-scale coffee producers in southwestern Ethiopia that sell coffee through the certified cooperative are better off. It is assumed that the coffee sales through, and membership of, a cooperative, allows farmers to improve their coffee production as well as to improve other aspects of their livelihood. A sustainable livelihood approach was used as the inspiration for the welfare indicators that needed to be considered, data collected amongst members and non-members of certified cooperatives, and a propensity score model to investigate the impact of cooperative membership on the livelihood indicators. Results suggest that members of certified cooperatives indeed receive, on average, better prices. Yet, no evidence was found that indicates that the higher price is translated into better household income. Furthermore, coffee plantation productivity of those members who were interviewed was lower than that of the non-members. This finding could explain the failure to find an overall effect. Since the majority of the producers' income emanate from coffee, a sustainable way of enhancing the productivity of the coffee could revitalize the welfare of the coffee producers.

N2  - Purpose: The inclusiveness of smallholder cocoa farmers in the international cocoa value chain is addressed in the context of institutional voids through linkages with different business models in the region of Bali, West-Sumatra and West-Sulawesi. Being the third highest producer of cocoa, local farmers have a high dependency on cocoa cultivation; however, they lack policies that foster and reward sustainable high-quality cocoa according to international standards. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: An explanatory multiple-case study design assessed the relevance of partnerships in contributing to sustainable local development and inclusiveness for smallholder farmers. The selected business models, business supported, NGO supported and government supported, are evaluated through improved access to finance, training, technology, subsidized inputs and markets. Findings: The paper found that a linkage with a business-supported model, here BT COCOA, achieves the best results in terms of improved yields, quality and farmer's welfare, indicating improved inclusiveness via successful process upgrading. Yet, future cooperation between stakeholders should improve on access to information and finance.

N2  - Over the past four decades of reform and opening-up, China has basically eradicated hunger and lifted over 700 million rural people out of poverty. China's poverty incidence has dropped to about 3%. These achievements can be attributed to the following factors: First, farmers have regained their economic freedom that was lost in the planned economy era. Second, China's top decision-makers have followed people's will by transitioning into the market economy and thus achieved rapid economic growth. Third, the government has continuously enhanced infrastructure and human capital investments, and implemented a social protection system in rural and urban areas nationwide. Fourth, integrated poverty reduction measures have been carried out to assist poor people in disadvantaged regions and those with poor capabilities. Given the diminishing poverty reduction effect of pro-poor fiscal funds, it is necessary to avoid direct administrative interventions in the operational decision-making of poor households and broaden institutional space for rural cooperative economy. Meanwhile, China should remove inequalities in the rights between the urban and rural households, facilitate the labor migration of the poor, and promote the urbanization of rural people.

N2  - Agricultural intensification and extensification are standard responses to ecological and economic vulnerability among smallholder communities. Climate change has exacerbated this vulnerability and thrown the complexity of and critical need for managing a healthy natural resource base while increasing on-farm productivity into sharp light. Sustainable intensification is one of many mechanisms for accomplishing this balancing act. This study examines the adoption of sustainable intensification practices, namely input packages focused on tef row planting--designed to boost yield and promote more efficient use of inputs. This study utilized a mix methods approach to survey 115 smallholder farmers in the South Wollo zone of the Amhara region in Ethiopia. This study found that cash and capital, more so than contact with the AIS, influenced farmers' decisions to adopt row planting input packages. Khat production was an important source of cash for inputs and was more likely to be available to farmers with irrigation schemes. Long-term, farmers who cultivate khat may not successfully engage in SI, as khat replaces traditional food crop production in the region. Yet, for farmers who do not grow khat, long-term investment in SI practices is unlikely unless access to affordable credit options is improved.

N2  - Using case studies of the bamboo and cinnamon value chains in rural areas of northern Vietnam, this paper contributes to the existing literature by analyzing barriers and suggests conditions under which value chain lending would be an effective tool for improving smallholder farmers' access to credit. A mixed method using both in-depth interviews with relevant stakeholders and a two-stage Heckman model is employed to explain the existing credit gap. Findings show that in both chains, bank decision-making on lending is typically limited to individual chain actors instead of considering the whole chain. Commercial banks predominately use conventional lending approaches heavily dependent on collateral which typically results in a shortage of credit available to the chain actors. Value chain lending is constrained by weak chain linkages and limited ownership of private bank accounts. Drawing from these cases in Vietnam, the article concludes by arguing that status quo value chain lending in lower-income countries merits considerable rethinking. The lending approaches of banks require innovation to 'think beyond collateral' in improving chain cohesion. Multi-stakeholder partnerships are important for successful value chain lending. In addition, farmer-based unions have the potential to address issues of information asymmetry in the credit market.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on farmers' decisions to adopt integrated pest management (IPM) technology and to estimate the impact of IPM adoption on farm economic performance. Design/methodology/approach: An endogenous switching probit model that addresses the sample selection bias issue arising from both observed and unobserved factors is used to estimate the survey data from a sample of 481 apple households in China. A treatment effects model is employed to estimate the impact of IPM adoption on apple yields, net returns and agricultural income. In order to address the potential endogeneity associated with off-farm work variable in estimating both cooperative membership choice specification and IPM adoption specifications, a control function approach is used. Findings: The empirical results show that cooperative membership exerts a positive and significant impact on the adoption of IPM technology. In particular, farmers' IPM adoption decision is significantly associated with household and farm-level characteristics (e.g. education, farm size and price knowledge). IPM adoption has a positive and statistically significant impact on apple yields, net returns and agricultural income.

N2  - What is the optimal size and composition of Rural Financial Cooperatives (RFCs)? With this broad question in mind, we characterize alternative formation of RFCs and their implications in improving rural households' access to financial services, including savings, credit and insurance services. We find that some features of RFCs have varying implications for delivering various financial services (savings, credit and insurance). We find that the size of RFCs exhibits nonlinear relationship with the various financial services RFCs provide. We also show that compositional heterogeneity among members (including diversity in wealth) is associated with higher access to credit services, while this has little implication on households' savings behavior. Similarly, social cohesion among members is strongly associated with higher access to financial services. These empirical descriptions suggest that the optimal size and composition of RFCs may vary across the domains of financial services they are designed to facilitate. These pieces of evidence provide some suggestive insights on how to ensure financial inclusion among smallholders, a pressing agenda and priority of policy makers in developing countries, including Ethiopia. The results also provide some insights into rural microfinance operations which are striving to satisfy members' demand for financial services.

N2  - Linking smallholder farmers to high-value markets through contract farming has become an important strategy to increase farm incomes in developing countries. However, various forms of opportunistic behaviour have been reported, threatening the sustainability of inclusive supply chains. When formal institutions are weak, informal codes of conduct like trust can be important complements to facilitate market transactions. We explore the effect of opportunistic behaviour on farmers' trust, using a field-framed trust experiment with prior signaling with small-scale farmers in Ecuador. These farmers are linked to different types of markets, including high-value export chains, and have been exposed to varying levels of opportunistic behaviour in the past. Our unique dataset allows us to control for self-selection of game participants. We find that a positive signal triggers a positive response increasing trust, while a negative signal has no effect--possibly reflecting very low overall trust levels. In settings where market linkages have failed previously, ex-ante credible positive signals could help to build trust and encourage small farmers' participation in sustainable value chains.

N2  - Development organizations are increasingly adopting market-based approaches to reducing rural poverty and food insecurity in the global South. The value chain approach is particularly popular. Aid donors, governments and non-governmental organizations are applying value chain concepts originally designed for promoting industrial production to smallholder agricultural production. Cashew development in Cote d'Ivoire illustrates this new approach to rural development in which 'upgrading' the production and processing links are top priorities. A core assumption informing this approach is that improvements in product quality at the producer level will yield higher producer prices and incomes. This article examines this assumed quality-price relationship through a comparative analysis of cashew quality and prices in Cote d'Ivoire. The research reveals a disconnect between nut quality and producer prices. The case study demonstrates that power relations are more important than quality in setting producer prices for raw cashew nuts.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine the stochastic net present value (NPV) of a model smallholder poultry operation in Rwanda under production and market uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach: A discounted cash flow calculator was used to determine the NPV of operator investments and operating cash flows, including time, materials and capital. Broiler production data, market prices and variable input costs were collected from 125 smallholder operations in the Musanze District, Rwanda. These data were combined with a historical price index tracking the inflation rate of Rwanda's currency. Policies including overstocking, technical support repayment scheduling, selling broilers at a spot market price, using marketing contracts and selling poultry manure were compared using non-parametric paired comparisons and stochastic dominance. Findings: Risk-neutral and risk-averse producers would prefer overstocking, delaying repayment of technical support services and selling manure to status quo operational policy. No differences were observed between the option to sell birds at spot market prices or through contracts.

N2  - Low-return livelihood strategies are crucial drivers of food insecurity that may cause irreversible long-term damage to livelihoods. Experiments and survey results were used to examine the relative importance of risk preference and socio-economic characteristics for households' decision to engage in specific livelihood strategies in rural Ethiopia. Agricultural intensification and diversification are prevailing strategies, and farming households who participate in non-farm activities are better off than others. Education, information access, household income and cooperative membership correlate significantly with high participation rates in non-farm activities and on-farm diversification. Risk preference is an especially important barrier to households' participation in these strategies. Therefore, policy interventions that help to expand farmers' asset base and reduce entry barriers to these strategies are required to improve smallholders' welfare.

N2  - This study focuses on economic effects of arable land fallow system and land-use change in China using a dynamic single-country, multi-regional computable general equilibrium model. Land supply is adjusted endogenously in our model. Land use in each of 31 provinces is tracked by a land-use change module, which is calibrated with satellite data. Our results reveal that the expansion of real output can be attributed to the increase in capital stock as a result of the growth of investment due to the imposition of the arable land fallow system in China. And the growth of investment is caused by the release of labor from agriculture The reduced supply of arable land in agricultural land contraction regions is partially offset by the increasing arable land in agricultural land expansion regions. Rural households benefit more than urban households from the arable land fallow policy due to relatively higher income and lower rural CPI.

N2  - This study provides an empirical evidence on market behaviour among male and female smallholder sweet potato farmers in South Eastern, Nigeria. A stratified sampling design using a multistage method was used to collect cross sectional data from 360 respondents in 2017. The results show that the male farmers participated more at farmgate sells while the female participated more in the market. The result on determinants of farmgate participation for the female farmers showed that age, number of extension contacts, household size, area of sweet potato cultivated, yield, transportation cost and market orientation were positive and significant. While capital, household size, yield, transportation cost, and market orientation were positive for the male farmers. The important determinants for sales at the market include; area of sweet potato cultivated, transportation cost, road condition and market orientation were positive and age negative for female farmers while the coefficients for level of education, household size, area of sweet potato cultivated, transportation cost and market orientation were positive, while age and distance from farm to the market were negative for male farmers. The result raised policies if attended to might unlock and release benefits associated with sweet potato marketing behavior. Such policies include: access to transport and good road network, use of quality planting seed for planting and farmers access to land. Formal or informal institutional arrangements like farmer groups should be encouraged as farmers can collectively access distant markets with good prices.

N2  - The transition toward sustainable agricultural production can be supported with improved insight into the performance of existing farming systems. The Sustainability Assessments of Food and Agriculture Systems (SAFA) framework published by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) provides a comprehensive and harmonised framework to assess and compare farming systems. We used the indicator-based SAFA consistent Sustainability Monitoring and Assessment RouTine (SMART) Farm Tool to analyze and compare the sustainability performance of certified organic and fair trade as well as non-certified smallholder farms in Uganda. Using the respective sustainability scores, we analyzed the synergies and trade-offs between sustainability themes using the non-parametric Spearman correlation test. We find that certification is associated with improved sustainability performance of smallholder coffee farms. It enhances the achievement of governance goals through its influences on group organization and collective capacities--this results in positive effects on other sustainability dimensions. Major synergies were observed between social and governance themes, and between economic and environmental themes. Although the extent and distribution of the synergies and trade-offs varied among farms, they were consistent between the production systems. These results show that the production systems can potentially have more influence on the sustainability performance than certification per se.

N2  - Food safety becomes an important issue in fast developing economies when a large growing market is supplied by many small producers through a prolonged supply chain. China is facing such a serious problem with its growing dairy market seeing serious food safety scandals. In this article, we examine a new organizational structure recently promoted by Chinese government, dairy complex, and its effects on farmers' behaviors related to safe production and the effectiveness of such behavior on the raw milk safety, using a joint production function under risk theoretical framework. Results show that farmers' production practices such as basic production environment and hygienic condition, disease prevention, and source and use of feed all contribute to the food safety of raw milk. Complex is an important factor contributing to farmers' adoption of such safety production practices, together with the supervision by government, production scale, contracts with processors, and price of raw milk. We, thus, found that dairy complex as an organization structure can influence the safety of raw milk indirectly through its impacts on farmers' production behaviors. Another important finding is that unsafe milk is a result of uncertainty when less strict production practice is used by risk lover producers, and the complexes work well for such farmers by pushing them to take more conservative safety measurements. This innovative production system can be a good measure for developing economies with similar small producer problems.

N2  - After years of neglect, there is a renewed interest in agricultural mechanization in Africa. Since government initiatives to promote mechanization are confronted with major governance challenges, private-sector initiatives may offer a promising alternative. However, given limited scientific studies on such private-sector options such approaches are often viewed skeptically. One concern is that multi-national agribusiness companies take advantage of smallholder farmers. Another concern is that mechanization causes rural unemployment. To shed light on these concerns, this paper analyzes an initiative of the agricultural machinery manufacturer John Deere to promote smallholder mechanization in Zambia through a contractor model. The analysis focuses on the impact of this initiative on farmers who receive tractor services using Propensity Score Matching. The results indicate that farmers can almost double their income by cultivating a much larger share of their land. The analysis suggests that the increased income is used for children's education and more food, but does not result in increased food diversity. The demand for hired labor increases due to land expansion and due to a shift from family labor, including that of children, to hired labor. Questions that require further investigation are identified, including strategies to incentivize tractor owners to provide services, to also increase land productivity, and to avoid new forms of dependency of agricultural laborers that may result from a shift in the timing of the labor demand.

N2  - Discrepancies in certification effects on smallholder incomes have been found in scientific literature. Unobserved farmer-group heterogeneity is a likely reason. For the long-standing Robusta coffee farmer-groups in Uganda, we find no significant effect of certification on net-farm income. But, we find 20 percentage point differences in net-farm income between certified and non-certified farmers explained by membership duration. In contrast, the recently founded certified Arabica coffee farmer-groups have positive net-farm income effects of 151 per cent, partly explained by a higher degree of vertical integration. With or without certification, long-standing group membership is found to have positive income effects.

N2  - This paper quantitatively assesses the effect of value chain development projects on market linkages of small-scale farmers of a staple crop and agricultural income. We focus on Nicaraguan bean producers participating in a value chain development project. Using a panel data set, we apply difference-in-differences and instrumental variables estimators to identify causal effects of programme participation. We first quantify the positive direct effect of training on bean sales in terms of quantity and percentage of beans sold in linked markets. Second, we show that intensified commercialisation contributes to total agricultural income, suggesting a positive indirect effect of the intervention. Our results indicate that market linkage of smallholder farmers requires different sets of intervention tools than farm technical assistance.

N2  - Agricultural cooperatives in China, known as "Farmers' Professional Cooperatives" (FPCs), are becoming popular and have been intensely promoted by the Chinese government to improve the economic welfare of small farmers. However, few studies on FPCs have measured the benefits to gain farmers who participate in FPCs after controlling for observable attributes of farmers. This paper investigates the treatment effect of participation in a rice-producing cooperative in suburban China using the propensity score matching (PSM) method. Estimated results show that a significant difference is observed between participants and nonparticipants of the cooperative in terms of net income from rice production. In addition, there is significant heterogeneity of the treatment effects between large and small farmers. Therefore, we can conclude that the participation in agricultural cooperatives is more beneficial to relatively small farmers who are subject to suffer from higher transaction costs.

N2  - Despite their apparent economic benefit to smallholder farmers, cooperatives are vulnerable to the problem of side selling. Using cross-sectional household data and Cragg's regression model, we identified the determinants of side selling by coffee cooperative farmers in southwest Ethiopia. The bootstrapping technique was applied to extract average partial effects from the model coefficients. Certified, elder and educated farmers who have off-farm income and trust in the cooperative leadership have been found to side-sell significantly less. Nonetheless, cooperative group size and late payment favoured more side selling. Based on these findings, possible interventions are highlighted for improving cooperative members' commitment and the performance of coffee cooperatives in the region.

N2  - In developing countries contract farming faces numerous challenges that many times lead to its failure. Innovations that help overcome the difficulties of contracting with a large pool of small farmers in such settings can enhance the viability of such schemes. We use a randomized control trial design combined with high frequency data to investigate the impact of adding a nutrition-based incentive in contracts between a Senegalese dairy processing factory and its semi-nomadic milk suppliers. The incentive rewarded suppliers for consistent milk deliveries with daily delivery of a micro-nutrient fortified yogurt for each young child in corresponding households. Findings show large and significant impacts on the frequency and amount of milk delivered, albeit limited to the dry season. We also find larger impacts on milk deliveries when contracts are managed by women.

N2  - Inclusive food value chain development is particularly challenging when numerous smallholders engage in production and trade of non-standardised food products within spatially dispersed systems. Drawing on the concept of human activity systems with an emphasis on purposefulness, we provide a situated account of the activities and relations that shape the pineapple value chain in Uganda. Based on semi-structured interviews with farmers, brokers and traders, we examined the creation and maintenance of business relationships as well as challenges faced. Findings show how trust unfolds to mediate exchange relations that structure chain organisation. Reflecting the uncertain business environment and vulnerability of actors, trustful relationships are simultaneously threatened by opportunities for short-term gain, referred to as "cheating". Embracing the importance of trust-based relational exchanges for sustaining local economic systems can provide critical leverage for development that puts smallholder farmers and other small-scale value chain actors at the centre.

N2  - The reconfigured agrarian structure imposed new production and commoditisation patterns across the settlement types in Zimbabwe. From 2000, new markets were established, with differentiated effects on capital accumulation for different sets of farmers. After the Fast Track Land Reform programme, the impact of the economy-wide challenges, climate change, capital and global geo-politics on the agrarian economy remain relatively unexplored. Using a case study of Hwedza District, this article reveals the changing agrarian relations beyond the trimodal agrarian structure, showing that smallholder farmers have significantly relied on reinvestment of agricultural sales proceeds rather than contract farming. Farmers exit the contract farming arrangements citing their exploitative nature. The article contributes to the debate on Zimbabwe's agrarian and political transition.

N2  - In order to change the situation that reimbursement rate of the new rural cooperative medical care system (NCMS) was too low to alleviate farmers medical burden, in August 2012, China began to expand the coverage of the NCMS to include the treatment of critical illnesses. Could more effective health insurance promote the consumption of rural residents? We studied the impact of the critical illness insurance (CII) on rural household consumption, and find that the CII increases per capita household daily consumption by >15%. But healthcare and medical expenditures have not been affected. Our comparison of outcomes for households with different levels of consumption and income shows the CII mainly promote the consumption of rural affluent family, but no incentive for poor family, resulting in deterioration of consumption inequality of rural households. The finding is robust to various alternative hypotheses and specifications.

N2  - Is there an alternative model to small family farming that could provide sustainable livelihoods to millions of resource-constrained and often non-viable smallholders in developing countries? Could group farming constitute such an alternative, wherein smallholders voluntarily pool land, labour and capital to create larger farms that they manage collectively? In South Asia, for instance, over 85% of farmers are small and increasingly female. Potentially, group farming could provide them economies of scale, a dependable labour force, more investible funds and skills, and greater bargaining power with governments and markets. But can this potential be realised in practice? In particular, can group farms economically outperform small family farms? A rare opportunity to test this is provided by two experiments begun in the 2000s in the Indian states of Kerala and Telangana. Constituted only of women, the groups lease in land to farm collectively, sharing labour, the cost of inputs, and the returns. But the states differ in several respects, including the technical support the groups receive, and their institutional base, composition, land access and cropping patterns. Based on the author's primary sample surveys in both states, this paper compares the productivity and profitability of group farms with that of small individual family farms in the same state. Kerala's groups perform strikingly better than the predominantly male-managed individual farms, both in their annual value of output per hectare and annual net returns per farm, while in Telangana group farms perform much worse than individual farms in annual output, but are equivalent in net returns. In both states, groups do much better in commercial crops than in traditional foodgrains, where the largely male-managed individual farms, owning good quality land and with longer farm management experience, have an advantage. The factors underlying the differential performances of Kerala and Telangana, and the lessons learnt for possible replication, are also discussed. Overall, the paper demonstrates that group farming can provide an effective alternative, subject to specified conditions and adaptation of the model to the local context.

N2  - The JYNNR--a Ramsar Site, Biosphere Reserve and important wintering ground for 15-18% of the world's Red Crowned Cranes--faces major pressure from regional development. This paper uses choice experiments to assess farmer preferences for an "eco-compensation" program targeting pesticide use by rural communities in and near the Jiangsu-Yancheng Coastal Wetlands Rare Birds National Nature Reserve (JYNNR). "Eco-compensation" is a China-specific term encompassing many incentive-based environmental management approaches. To identify options to reconcile rural welfare improvement with conservation, data was collected from 311 rural households in and near the JYNNR assessing perceptions of the JYNNR, wetland birds, use and impact of pesticides, and preferences for contracts to mitigate pesticide impacts. Results suggest that conflict with the JYNNR is growing, and that pesticide management could be an effective entry-point for engagement. The analysis finds several options for cost-effective contracts: granting rights to leave the program without penalty and increasing share of household land enrolled significantly reduce willingness-to-accept-payment (WTA), while longer contracts and larger reductions in pesticide use increase WTA, which interact meaningfully with farmer characteristics. Providing communities with training and technical support on proper pesticide use could, under specific contract structures, be sufficient to induce 100% enrollment without subsidies.

N2  - Contract farming is a growing practice in developing countries and first-world economies alike. It generates necessary guarantees to sustain the continued operations of vulnerable farmers while enabling the manufacturers to manage the aggregate supply and price risk. We consider a single manufacturer who owns several manufacturing plants, each with a random demand for the crop. The manufacturer selects a set of farmers to offer a menu of contracts, which is exogenously specified or endogenously determined. Each "selected" farmer chooses a contract from this menu in advance of the growing season. After the growing season, under known demands and supplies, the manufacturer minimizes the distribution costs from the selected farmers to the production facilities. We formulate this problem as a Stackelberg game with asymmetric information, where the manufacturer is the leader and the farmers are the followers. The manufacturer's problem is a two-stage stochastic planning program for which we develop two solution approaches. We have applied our model to problem instances anchored on data from a large manufacturer of potato chips contracting with thousands of small farmers in India. We report on the performance of the solution methods compared with a lower bound based on the Lagrangean dual of the problem and show that the optimality gap is below 1 percent, for problem instances with 1,000 potential farmers. We also show how our model can be used to gain various managerial insights. As an example, when constructing the contract menu endogenously, often a small number of contract options suffices, depending on the degree of heterogeneity among the farmer pool. Thus, relatively simple menus often suffice.

N2  - Teff (Eragrostis tef) is a major staple grain of Ethiopia, where the crop was domesticated from 4000 to 1000 BC. The high food-value Teff flour is basically used for preparing injera--a spongy pancake, the major component of the Ethiopian national dish. Due to its gluten-free quality and high mineral content, the popularity of Teff has been increasing in the western world. Very little is known, about the households that produce and consume Teff in Ethiopia. Using information from more than 9000 households collected by the World Bank and the Central Statistical Agency-Ethiopia in 2011-2012 and 2013-2014, and applying econometric estimation approaches, this study reveals that Teff is mainly produced by uneducated, male-headed rural households which have access to relatively more land and more family labor. In contrast, a higher proportion of Teff is consumed by urban households and those headed by an older, educated head. Based on the findings, this study asserts that the productivity of Teff should be enhanced by developing and disseminating high-yielding varieties as Teff consumption has been increasing in general and, secondly, the resource-poor Teff cultivators should be linked with the global value chain which may bring extra benefits to them in Ethiopia; however, the loss of domestic consumers' surplus should also be considered economically.

N2  - Smallholder agriculturalists employ a range of strategies to adapt to climate variability. These adaptive strategies include decisions to plant different seed varieties, changes to the array of cultivated crops, and shifts in planting dates. Smallholder access to irrigation water is crucial to the adoption of such strategies, and uncertainty of water availability may prove to be a stimulating force in a smallholder's decision to adjust their on-farm practices. Within smallholder irrigation systems, attributes at multiple levels influence water availability and collective action, and in the process play a role in adaptation: community-level governance institutions may influence trust in others and the ability to overcome appropriation and provisioning dilemmas, and, at the household-level, the availability of irrigation water and socioeconomic and demographic factors may influence farmer willingness to take on the risk of altering their on-farm practices. In this study we investigate smallholder adaptation in Kenya from multiple levels. Specifically, we identify the role of household- and community-level characteristics in shaping smallholder experimentation with different seed varieties. Standard ordinary least squares and logistic regressions are constructed to assess the influence of these interactions on smallholder adaptation. We further discuss the ability of smallholders to respond to poor water provisioning. Among the study's findings is evidence that smallholders are more willing to employ adaptive measures if they have a limited capacity to irrigate.

N2  - Substantial literature exists on household lifestyles and related energy use and emissions in the global north, but little is known for many countries the global south. We estimate household-level energy footprints for Zambia covering direct (traditional and modern energy carriers) and indirect energy use, and adopting energy extended multiregional input-output. We employ final energy consumption, as it is closer to energy services and thus the purpose of energy use than the total primary energy use. The inequality in energy footprints differs from the inequality in incomes: the poorest half of the households have similar energy footprints and only high-income urban households have significant indirect energy footprints, associated with spend on goods and services. We examine the association between energy footprints and basic well-being measured in terms of physical health, education, nutrition and access to clean water using logistic regression, for a sub-sample of households with children under the age of five. We find that access to provisioning systems is more important than income for need satisfaction. Rural households have limited access to modern energy and provisioning systems and as a result fewer of them attain desirable well-being outcomes. We conclude that access to collective provisioning systems such as education, electricity and indoor sanitation is more important for household need satisfaction than individual provisioning in the form of ownership of durables, or even income. Further research is needed to improve the understanding of the association between energy use and needs satisfaction as it is crucial for addressing decarbonisation and human development agendas.

N2  - Although decades of research show long-duration pigeon peas (PPs) as a best-bet technology that enhances nutrition, soil fertility, crop diversification, food security, climate-change resilience, agroecological sustainability, and incomes of resource-poor smallholder farmers in Saharan Africa (SSA), PP adoption remains low. This exploratory qualitative study examines obstacles to PP adoption and their relative importance, strategies used to protect PPs from livestock damage, and the conditions that shape the emergence and effectiveness of Community Based Livestock Management (CBLM) arrangements to prevent PP damage. We conducted focus group discussions, participatory rural appraisal (PRA), and key-informant interviews in five communities at different levels and duration of PP adoption, and used theoretical insights from agrarian political economy. Livestock damage was the biggest obstacle to PP growing in new PP sites; poor markets and production factors dominated in the established sites. Individual crop-protection strategies were often time-consuming, costly, and/or ineffective. While chief-based livestock-management systems protected all crops satisfactorily during the rainy season, they were insufficient to protect PPs during the dry season. CBLM arrangements controlled livestock damage and protected PP relatively effectively throughout the year. Implemented only at the relatively established PP-growing sites, CBLM arrangements were most effective at the site (Mpokwa) where PP prices were good and markets reliable, PP was the top or major cash crop, PP growers were powerful and in the majority, and institutions pre-existed for use in CBLM. The findings lead to the following hypothesis: smallholder farmers are likely to invest time and energy in collective livestock-management approaches to prevent damage to pigeon peas when expected economic benefits of adoption exceed perceived costs for most growers, mediated by socioeconomic differentiation and power relations among major stakeholders. Future research should empirically examine determinants of CBLM emergence for PP protection and scale-up.

N2  - Contract farming (CF) arrangements have the potential to address market failures and improve technology adoption, productivity, and welfare. In Ghana, government and donors use CF as a strategy for increasing adoption of new agricultural technologies and developing value chains. Yet to date, there has not been a rigorous assessment of these CF schemes. The focus in this paper is on different maize-based CF schemes in the poorest and most remote region in Ghana. It assesses the profitability and potential impact of these CF schemes, utilizing a unique plot-level dataset that covers two periods of data and two maize plots (scheme and non-scheme) per household, and employing matching techniques and an instrumental variable approach to address selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity across farmers. These are complemented by a community-level survey, in-depth interviews with scheme operators, and a series of key informant interviews. Results show that these schemes led to improved technology adoption and yield increases. In addition, a subset of maize farmers with high yield improvements due to CF participation have high profits. Maize CF schemes also enabled market coordination and consistent supply of quality maize to downstream industries. However, on average, the impact of the CF schemes on profitability is negative, even when input diversion is accounted for. Yield increases are not high enough to compensate for higher input requirements and the cost of capital under the schemes. Despite higher yields, the costs to produce one metric tonne of maize under CF schemes are higher than on maize farms without CF schemes, twice that of several countries in Africa, and more than seven times higher than that of major maize-exporting countries (the United States, Brazil, and Argentina). Sustainability of these CF schemes will largely depend on developing and promoting much-improved varieties and technologies that boost yields in order to compensate for the high input and credit costs.

N2  - Smallholder farmers in developing countries often suffer from high risk and limited market access. Contract farming may improve the situation under certain conditions. Several studies analyzed effects of contracts on smallholder productivity and income with mixed results. Most existing studies focused on one particular contract scheme. Contract characteristics rarely differ within one scheme, so little is known about how different contract characteristics may influence the benefits for smallholders. Here, we address this research gap using data from oil palm farmers in Ghana who participate in different contract schemes. Some of the farmers have simple marketing contracts, while others have resource-providing contracts where the buyer also offers inputs and technical services on credit. A comparison group cultivates oil palm without any contract. Regression models that control for selection bias show that resource-providing contracts increase farmers' input use and yield. Resource-providing contracts also incentivize higher levels of specialization and an increase in the scale of production. These effects are especially pronounced for small and medium-sized farms. In contrast, the marketing contracts have no significant effects on input use, productivity, and scale of production. The results suggest that resource-providing contracts alleviate market access constraints, while simple marketing contracts do not in this context.

N2  - This paper is about making agricultural value chains work for smallholder farmers, and the way that governments can achieve this aim through public-private partnerships (PPPs). Applied to agricultural value chains, PPPs seek to catalyze new investments, support chain upgrading, or improve the performance of poorly functioning chains through joint activities that capitalize on the complementary resources and competencies of public and private partners. Smallholder farmers are frequently the intended beneficiaries. However, there is little understanding of how the terms of value chain participation affect farmer perceptions of and behavior within chains, or the role of the public sector in influencing these arrangements. This paper analyzes in-depth case studies from Ghana, Indonesia, Rwanda, and Uganda to better understand a surprising empirical finding: that farmers that experience strong PPP results in terms of productivity and incomes may nevertheless remain dissatisfied, while those experiencing much more modest gains can view the PPP favorably. At the heart is an analytical framework based on five attributes of "procedural justice". It finds that public sector actors, through PPPs, are able to shape governance within value chains, influencing the relative skills, knowledge, and resources which different actors possess, the way that farmers are organized to engage in the value chain, and the attributes of procedural justice reflected in chain arrangements. Where procedural justice is weak, farmers are more likely to exit or neglect the arrangements, leaving the value chain underperforming with sub-optimal outcomes for all: for farmers, for lead firms, and for government agencies. Government involvement in value chains should be premised on facilitating relationships that are more procedurally just than those which would be expected to arise through the market alone.

N2  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of financial inclusion on poverty alleviation through cooperative banks. Design/methodology/approach In order to fulfil the objectives of the study, primary data were collected from 540 beneficiaries of cooperative banks operating in three northern states of India, i.e., J&K, Himachal Pradesh (HP), and Punjab using purposive sampling during July-December 2015. The technique of factor analysis had been used for summarisation of the total data into minimum factors. For checking the validity and reliability of the data, the second-order CFA was performed. Statistical techniques like one-way ANOVA, t-test, and SEM were used for data analysis. Findings The study results reveal that financial inclusion through cooperative banks has a direct and significant impact on poverty alleviation. The study highlights that access to basic financial services such as savings, loans, insurance, credit, etc., through financial inclusion has generated a positive impact on the lives of the poor and helps them to come out of the clutches of poverty. Research limitations/implications The study was conducted amidst few limitations. First, the in-depth analysis of the study is restricted to three northern states only because of limited resources and time availability. Second, the study is limited to the perception of financial inclusion beneficiaries only, which, in future, could be carried further on the perception of other stakeholders such as bank officials, business correspondents, village panchayats, etc. Originality/value The study makes contribution towards the financial inclusion literature relating to poverty alleviation and fulfills the research gap to some extent by assessing the impact of financial inclusion on poverty alleviation through cooperative banks. This paper can help the policymakers and other stakeholders of cooperative banks in promoting banking habits among poor rural households both at the national and international level.

N2  - Extraction of environmental resources and migration are closely related livelihood strategies of rural households in developing countries. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the relationship between environmental income and remittances is needed to lower the existing pressure on environmental resources and to promote rural development. This study aims at investigating this relationship by using panel data at the household and village levels collected in 2013, 2016, and 2017 from three provinces in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. A Heckman model is applied to identify the factors of the decision to send remittances. A fixed effects two-stage least squares analysis is conducted to investigate the determinants of environmental income and a quantile regression shows the distribution of effects. The findings reveal differences between asset-poor and -rich households. Since the former are often more dependent on labour-intensive livelihood strategies such as extraction, a decrease in household labour due to migration leads to reduced extraction. For asset-rich households who are normally less capital-constrained, remittances lead to more extraction of natural resources. The findings support the claim for encouraging rural labour markets and education, especially for asset-poor people, and for a sustainable and collective natural resource management.

N2  - Increasingly, value chain approaches are integrated with multi-stakeholder processes to facilitate inclusive innovation and value chain upgrading of smallholders. This pathway to smallholder integration into agri-food markets has received limited analysis. This article analyses this integration through a case study of an ongoing smallholder dairy development programme in Tanzania. Value chain upgrading and innovation systems perspectives were combined in an analytical framework to interpret the findings, which show that multi-stakeholder processes enhance horizontal and vertical coordination but limit process and product upgrading. The main conclusion is that, although such processes may catalyze smallholder market inclusion, their effects are largely bounded by existing value chain structures (e.g. production system, fragmented markets), timeframe and how prevailing institutional constraints are addressed, which may constrain the intentions of such collaboration action. This calls attention to the starting points of value chain interventions and the socio-political dynamics that are part of multi-stakeholder processes.

N2  - This article examines the phenomenon of uncertified producers of otherwise certifiable organic food embedded in value chains whose farm products conform to elevated environmental standards. Having embraced so called "beyond organic" cultivation approaches--including agroecology, biodynamic, and permaculture--producers undertaking restorative ecological practices on their farms are certification worthy, in principle, while remaining either unwilling or unable to pay to upgrade to premium markets, in practice. Confronted with the trade-off between allocating scarce resources to compliance and credibility--producers creating collective public goods may do so at the expense of being able to signal the credibility of their actions as environmental stewards along value chains, as through private, third party certification schemes. Drawing on insights from multiple waves of ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Nicaragua beginning in 2007, I show how this credibility dilemma exacerbates challenges already facing smallholders--including livelihood insecurity, political instability, and environmental degradation--demanding new institutional innovations that effectively lower the cost of credibility. In Nicaragua, peasant associations responded to this challenge by advancing an innovative institutional arrangement--the Grupo de Promocion de Agricultura Ecologica (GPAE) marca de confianza, Group for the Promotion of Ecological Agriculture's trademark of trust--to commercialize fresh produce destined for local consumption and new niche markets via networks of trusted producer communities.

N2  - Integration of smallholders in outgrower schemes has been advanced as a strategy for poverty reduction in the global south, but how terms and conditions of inclusion and exclusion shape divergent outcomes, and processes underpinning these local dynamics remain an under-researched area. This study, set in Zambia's southern 'sugarbelt' region of Mazabuka, draws on two contrasting outgrower schemes to examine determinants of smallholder inclusion in sugar value-chains, and consider how various terms and conditions underpinning inclusion shape various interests, reactions and pathways for value capture among different local groups. Our study reveals terms and conditions are important in shaping divergent outcomes for smallholders included in sugar value-chains. It shows determinants of inclusion and exclusion are complex and go beyond market imperatives that are production related (structural) to include social-cultural dynamics (non-structural). The centrality of the paper points to lived realities and experiences for different groups and political reactions from below, underlining how socially contested intersection of global-local value-chain produces diverse but interdependent hierarchies of inclusion and exclusion. For an early stage in planning of outgrower schemes by state and non-state actors, recognition of the various social groups and their complex engagement and reactions to changes in land-use and land control will not only expose competing interests but should inform polices, institutions and investments to improve value-chain impacts. This paper hopes to contribute towards a more nuanced understanding of the complex engagement of smallholders in changes in land use and land control in developing countries in the era of land-grabbing.

N2  - In the mid-1990s, fairtrade-organic registration data showed that only 9% of Oaxaca, Mexico's organic coffee 'farm operators' were women; by 2013 the female farmer rate had increased to 42%. Our research investigates the impact of this significant increase in women's coffee association participation among 210 members of two coffee producer associations in Oaxaca, Mexico. We find that female coffee organization members report high levels of household decision-making power and they are more likely than their male counterparts to report control over their coffee income. These significant advances in women's agency within the household are offset by the fact that the women experience significant time poverty as they engage in coffee production while bearing a disproportionate share of domestic labor obligations. The women coffee producers view organizational labor as a third burden on their time, after their reproductive and productive labor. The time poverty they experience limits their ability to fully participate in coffee organizational governance and consequently there are few women leaders at all levels of the coffee producer businesses. This is problematic because it limits women's ability to fully benefit from organizational membership: when women fully participate in governance they gain valuable business and leadership skills and producer associations with active female members may also be more likely to develop and maintain programs and policies that enhance gender equity. Our findings indicate that targeted agricultural development programs to improve gender equity among agricultural smallholders should involve creative ways to ease women's labor burdens and reduce their time poverty in order to facilitate full organizational participation. The research findings fill a gap in existing studies of agricultural global value chains (GVCs) by demonstrating how the certified coffee GVC depends on women's under and un-paid labor not only within the household but also within producer organizations.

N2  - We study the dynamics of smallholder participation in export value chains focusing on the example of small-scale broccoli producers in the highlands of Ecuador. Combining cross-sectional data from a household survey with 11-year longitudinal data on export market transactions, we explain the hazards of dropping out of a high-value export chain. We apply a multispell cox duration model that allows us to consider multiple entries and exits from the supply chain. We also provide evidence on the welfare impacts associated with participation. The results suggest that small-scale farmers' exit from the export sector is accelerated by high transaction risks experienced in the past. While we find no particular evidence for the exclusion of small-scale farmers from the export sector, we do find that poorer households and female-headed households tend to drop out faster, especially as long as the sector is still prospering. Finally, when considering welfare effects, we do not find evidence that participation translates into tangible benefits for broccoli farmers. We discuss some measures that could help improve the long-term sustainability of smallholder integration in high-value chains.

N2  - The study evaluates the impact of risk on enterprises of male, female and young farmers operating in the formal and informal smallholder dairy value chains in Tanzania. It also examines the effect of uncertainty on the decision to invest in milk production in the two value chains. Results indicate that youths in the informal dairy value chain face the greatest level of risk followed by men in the formal value chain, and then men in the informal value chain. Women in both value chains and youths in the formal value chain face relatively low risk. Overall, milk production in the informal value chain is found to be substantially riskier than production in the formal chain. Optimal investment triggers are found to be much larger than the conventional triggers and are sensitive to volatility of returns. The results' managerial and policy implications for inclusive dairy industry development in Tanzania are highlighted.

While the existing literature has widely studied intrahousehold dynamics in domains such as agriculture and health, very little is known about the bargaining power of women in ASM and their household dynamics. Through in-depth interviews with 49 women artisanal miners in Prestea-Bondaye mining area in the Prestea-Huni Valley Municipality of Ghana, this paper considers how women's engagement in ASM changes the dynamics within their households and impacts their bargaining power. Findings showed that most women artisanal miners were not in support of pooling income with their husbands with most of them using their income to alter the dynamics of household decision-making concerning food to cook for the family, children's education and family size. Extended family relations as a form of social norm were found to determine women artisanal miners' decision not to pool income with their husbands. The findings, therefore, problematise the unitary model of household decision-making and provide a nuanced analysis of rural household power dynamics in a mining context, which is grossly unexplored. However, various aspects of intrahousehold bargaining models--cooperative, non-cooperative and collective--were found under different circumstances depending on the household needs and artisanal women miners' relations with husbands and their extended family. Findings also showed that women's participation in ASM was changing household dynamics, particularly sexual interactions with their partners and childcare responsibilities. Although women's participation in ASM results in higher levels of bargaining power, the Minerals Commission of Ghana, gender advocacy institutions and other relevant stakeholders must engage in policy discussions to streamline women's activities and find possible ways of dealing with their challenges in the sector.

N2  - We conducted a laboratory-in-the-field experiment with real-life tenants in Ethiopia to test the incentive effects of fixed wage, sharecropping, fixed rent, and ownership contracts. The experimental task resembles a common process in agricultural production. The sharecropping contract is a piece rate scheme framed as a profit-sharing agreement. Sharecropping output was about 12 percent smaller than the fixed rent output. Surprisingly, it is statistically indistinguishable from the fixed wage output, despite substantial piece rates. This effect is driven by real-life sharecroppers. Their sharecropping output was smaller than that of non-sharecroppers, especially in a region where a controversial land reform took place. We argue that our subjects dislike sharecropping contracts because of the unfair profit sharing and the disputed allocation of land. Fairness concerns, therefore, may be another impediment to efficiency under the sharecropping contract.

N2  - We investigate the unique contractual arrangement between a large Ethiopian sugar factory and its adjacent outgrower associations. The only significant difference between the sugarcane production on the factory-operated sugarcane plantation and on the outgrower-operated plots is the remuneration system and thus, the incentives to the workers. We compare the productivity of these two production schemes using a cross-sectional plot-level data set. As sugarcane production depends on various exogenous factors that are measured as categorical variables (e.g., soil type, cane variety, etc.), we estimate the production function by a nonparametric kernel regression method that takes into account both continuous and categorical explanatory variables without assuming a functional form and without imposing restrictions on interactions between the explanatory variables. Our results show that outgrower-operated plots have--ceteris paribus--a statistically and economically significantly higher productivity than factory-operated plots, which can be explained by outgrowers having stronger incentives to put more effort into their work than the employees of the sugar factory.

N2  - This paper examines the impacts of agricultural cooperative membership on output price, gross income, farm profit, and return on investment (ROI) utilizing a recent household survey data of 481 apple producers in China. We employ a treatment effects model to account for potential selection bias that arises from the fact that cooperative members and nonmembers are systematically different in terms of both observable and unobservable factors. Our analysis reveals that cooperative membership has a positive and statistically significant impact on apple price, gross income, farm profit, and ROI. In addition, we find that the highest profit effect of cooperative membership does not in fact result in the highest ROI effect of the membership, revealing differences in farm income and profitability of investment.

N2  - Contract farming (CF), an institutional innovation, can reduce transaction costs and solve market imperfections in many developing countries. This study compares productivity and technical efficiency (TE) of contract and independent producers of high yielding variety (HYV) paddy seed (a low-value crop) and ginger (a high-value crop) producers in a sample of smallholders in Nepal. We address the self-selection into CF by using propensity score matching and translog stochastic frontier function to estimate our empirical model. Using farm-level data from Nepal, our findings show that CF increased the average TE levels of HYV paddy seed producers from 87% to 94% and the average TE levels of ginger producers from 89% to 97%. Finally, we find that human capital and distance to the market increases the technical inefficiency of low-value crop smallholders in Nepal.

N2  - Demand for organic basmati rice (OBR), both at home and abroad, coupled with policy reforms have given rise to contract farming (CF) production in India. OBR production, however, is highly susceptible to weather and pest risks. This study investigates the impact of smallholders' perceived production risks on their adoption of CF in OBR farming. We also assess the impact of CF in OBR production on yields, prices received, and the livelihood of OBR producers. We use farm-level data from smallholder organic basmati rice farms in India and the endogenous switching regression method to account for heterogeneity. Although CF in OBR led to lower yields, it increased the prices producers received and improved the livelihood of OBR producers. The impact of CF varied with farmers' revealed risk attitudes. Risk-loving OBR growers with CF experienced the highest loss in yields, and risk-averse OBR growers with CF received the highest prices. We find that the OBR growers who did not adopt CF would benefit from adopting it, regardless of their risk attitudes, especially when it comes to prices received and livelihood.

N2  - Organising smallholder farmers into groups has become an important and preferred mechanism through which the South African government and other rural development agencies seek to address rural poverty and household food insecurity. This study investigates whether collective action through farmer groups has improved incomes among rural farming households in South Africa. The propensity score matching (PSM) method and the treatment effect approach were used to analyse a sample of 984 rural households from four districts in KwaZulu-Natal. The PSM results indicated that participation in farmer groups significantly and positively influenced household incomes. Group membership increased the average household incomes per adult equivalent by about R3000. However, the Rosenbaum bounds tests indicated that the impact estimates obtained using the PSM approach were not robust to hidden bias. The treatment effect regression model, which controls for hidden bias, was estimated, and the results supported those of PSM. The results also indicated that groups benefit more those who are educated and are males, suggesting a bias against the females and those less educated. The results suggest that organising smallholder farmers into groups can play a positive role in rural poverty reduction. For greater impact, policy makers should promote group formation and participation among smallholder farmers as well as introduce adult literacy classes to improve education levels.

N2  - Sustainable Partnerships to Enhance Rural Enterprises and Agricultural Development (SPREAD) was a programme to enhance the value chain for commodities in Rwanda including coffee. The implicit concept was that improving the value chain would increase the incomes for smallholders and, hence, reduce the poverty rate. The results indicate that Rwanda coffee prices increased relative to an index price for traded coffee with the implementation of SPREAD. In addition, the results indicate that participation in the coffee market at this time was associated with higher household income and lower rates of poverty.

N2  - Oil palm research is performed to develop new and upgraded products to face global challenges and thus, the industry is emerging as a dependable source of empowerment for the country. However, it also poses a serious threat due to unawareness of sustainability issues by the smallholders. Thus, this study assesses the actions of oil palm smallholders in a sustainable manner from the environmental, economic, and social perspectives. The primary data is collected through a questionnaire survey with 50 supported smallholders in the Terengganu state under the FELDA scheme in Malaysia. The result demonstrates that dependent smallholders with primary level education are responsible for most of the pollution in the environment due to wrong agricultural practices. The study suggests that there is room for improvement in the social, environmental, and economic aspects of sustainability through intensive and quality training, depending on the role played by the authorities and the dependent smallholder cooperatives.

N2  - Agriculture is considered to be one of the major drivers of deforestation worldwide. In developing countries in particular this process is driven by small-scale agriculture. At the same time, many African governments aim to increase agricultural productivity. Empirical evidence suggests, however, that win-win relationships between agricultural intensification and forest conservation are the exception. Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) could be linked to agriculture support programmes to simultaneously achieve both goals. Due to potentially higher profits from intensified agriculture than from pure cash transfers, potential payment recipients may prefer in-kind over conventional cash payments. Nevertheless, little scientific evidence exists regarding the preferences of potential PES recipients for such instruments. We report from a discrete choice experiment in Zambia that elicited preferences of smallholder farmers for PES contracts. Our results suggest that potential PES recipients in Zambia value in-kind agricultural inputs more highly than cash payments (even when the monetary value of the inputs is lower than the cash payment), highlighting that PES could potentially succeed in conserving forests and intensifying smallholder agriculture. Respondents who intended to clear forest within the next three years were found to require higher payments, but could be motivated to enrol in appropriately designed PES.

N2  - Using both household level and plot-level data from Northern Bangladesh, this paper analyzes the difference in agricultural productivity across different contractual arrangements among ultra-poor households. Employing the fixed-effect model on the pseudo panel data, the paper finds evidence of sub-optimal use of inputs and, consequently, lower productivity for lands cultivated under sharecropping contracts. The inefficiency on the part of sharecroppers is also evident from the stochastic frontier model. Although the paper finds that credit has no direct impact on productivity, the results of Logit estimates suggest that availability of credit induces households to opt for fixed-rental contracts.

N2  - This study analyzes the nexus issues of energy use, agricultural production, income and employment among heterogeneous and interdependent rural households in Uttar Pradesh, India. We use an agricultural household dynamic programming model that includes two types of households differentiated by their socio-economic characteristics and that are linked through agricultural contracts. Households are also differentiated by their membership in terms of men, women and children. The model simulates the effects of policies such as state subsidies for the purchase of solar panels, improvement in non-agricultural employment opportunities, and combinations of the two, as they are suggested to improve energy supply and reduce trade-offs in energy use. The model results indicate that households improve energy use patterns by using solar panels; yet, adoption of such technology is conditional on state subsidy levels of 50% and 80% for the purchase of solar panels for farming and domestic purposes respectively. Subsidies for solar panels together with improvement of off-farm work increases off-farm employment levels and income of the poorer household, however, this policy reduces agricultural production. In addition, the wealthier household incurs losses from improvement in non-agricultural employment opportunities due to reduced labor availability for farm operations.

N2  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that agricultural commodity value chain development using multi-stakeholder partnerships (MSPs) can fast-track improvement in the livelihoods of rural farming households. With the view that such partnerships can raise farmers' incomes, the study uses the case of the organic pineapple (OP) value chain in Ntungamo, Western Uganda, to understand the governance features that hold the value chain partners together, to analyse the costs and margins to the participating farmers, to identify opportunities for demand-driven upgrading of the farmers' skills and knowledge, and the role that partnerships play in such upgrading. Design/methodology/approach The study uses the qualitative tools of value chain analysis: value chain maps of stakeholders, processes and support services of the OP value chain, and a quantitative tool to analyse costs and margins to the participating farmers. Interviews were conducted with key informants from the OP innovation platform, and survey data collected for the planting season, February-July, 2014, across three farmer categories of certified organic, conventional, and farmers not participating in the innovation platform. Findings Careful selection of partnerships to develop the value chain is found to be critical. Partners to involve should be those that enable the upgrading of farmers' knowledge, skills and technologies to position them for better markets. Partners should also include those that enable the improvement of margins to the farmers and efficiency of the value chain. The strategic MSPs should be bound by formal contracts, to ensure stable relationships in the value chain and hence sustainable market access for the farmers.

N2  - Smallholder farmers in Rattanakmondol District, Battambang Province, Cambodia face challenges related to soil erosion, declining yields, climate change, and unsustainable tillage-based farming practices in their efforts to increase food production within maize-based systems. In 2010, research for development programs began introducing agricultural production systems based on conservation agriculture (CA) to smallholder farmers located in four communities within Rattanakmondol District as a pathway for addressing these issues. Understanding gendered practices and perspectives is integral to adapting CA technologies to the needs of local communities. This research identifies how gender differences regarding farmers' access to assets, practices, and engagement in intra-household negotiations could constrain or facilitate the dissemination of CA. Our mixed-methods approach includes focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews, farmer field visits, and a household survey. Gender differences in access to key productive assets may affect men's and women's individual ability to adapt CA. Farmers perceive the practices and technologies of CA as labor-saving, with the potential to reduce men's and women's labor burden in land-preparation activities. However, when considered in relation to the full array of productive and reproductive livelihood activities, CA can disproportionately affect men's and women's labor. Decisions about agricultural livelihoods were not always made jointly, with socio-cultural norms and responsibilities structuring an individual's ability to participate in intra-household negotiations. While gender differences in power relations affect intra-household decision-making, men and women household members collectively negotiate the transition to CA-based production systems.

N2  - The expansion of modern markets has significant implications for agriculture in many developing countries that provides both opportunities and challenges for smallholder farmers. The purpose of this paper is to analyse key determinants affecting farmers' participation in high value markets, compared to traditional market. Face to face interviews based on a questionnaire were conducted with a sample of 126 smallholder vegetable farmers in the Manokwari region. Binary logistic regression and bivariate correlation analysis were used in this study. The results suggested that age, education level, vegetables cultivated area and membership in farmer groups/cooperatives were the key determinants that had significant effects on the smallholder farmers' decision about marketing channel participation. In addition, the income generated from vegetable farming was positively correlated to high value market participation. Some implications that need to be prioritized in agricultural development strategies include improving technical innovations and empowering collective actions through cooperatives or farmer groups.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of smallholder supply chains on sustainable sourcing to answer the question how food and agribusiness multinationals can best include smallholders in their sourcing strategies and take social responsibility for large-scale sustainable and more equitable supply. A sustainable smallholder sourcing model with a list of critical success factors (CSFs) has been applied on two best-practise cases. In this model, business and corporate social responsibility perspectives are integrated. Design/methodology/approach: The primary data of the value chain analyses of the two smallholder supply chains of a food and agribusiness multinational have been applied. Both cases were of a join research program commissioned by the multinational and a non-governmental organization using the same methods and research tools. Similarities, differences and interference between the cases have been determined and assessed in order to confirm, fine tune or adjust the CSFs. Findings: Both cases could be conceptualized through the smallholder sourcing model. Most CSFs could be found in both cases, but differences were also found, which led to fine tuning of some CSFs: building of a partnership and effective producers organization, providing farm financing and the use of cross-functional teams in smallholder supplier development programs. It was also concluded that the smallholder sourcing model is applicable in different geographical areas.

N2  - The study examined the mediating role of social capital in the relationship between institutions and financial inclusion of poor households in rural Uganda. Cross-sectional design was adopted and data were collected and analyzed using SPSS/20, MedGraph and Sobel-z test. The findings indicated that social capital partially mediates the relationship between institutions and financial inclusion. Besides, institutions and financial inclusion are significantly related. Thus, managers of financial institutions, financial inclusion working groups, and policy makers should pay more attention to the role of social capital in promoting cooperative behavior among the poor in accessing scarce resources such as financial services.

N2  - Purpose The decision by the Government of Kenya in 2013 to increase tax revenue by imposing excise duty of 50 percent on sorghum beer resulted in economic losses for smallholders, the brewery, and the government itself because it effectively killed the value chain. In 2015, the government reversed the policy decision and reduced excise duty to 10 percent. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of this policy decision on the value chain, adaptation by growers and the brewery, and the rationale for this policy change and its reversal. Design/methodology/approach The author analyzes this episode using a conceptual framework derived from complex adaptive systems, focusing on four properties of such systems: sudden, endogenous shocks, interacting agents, and adaptation. Findings The author shows how the nature of politics in Kenya exposed the value chain to endogenous shocks as the result of conflicts between interacting agents, where smallholder farmer organizations were important for successful adaptation. Conflicts between development and political objectives in neo-patrimonial states are sources of complexity and uncertainty in smallholder value chains.

N2  - In this paper, we analyze the impact of smallholder participation in a contract-farming scheme in the rice sector in Benin. We use data from a cross-sectional farm-household survey and different propensity score matching estimations to reveal how participation in a contract-farming scheme affects smallholder rice production. We find that contract-farming results in expansion of the rice area, intensification of rice production, increased commercialization of rice, and higher farm-gate prices, and ultimately contributes to rice output growth and increased income. Our findings imply that contract-farming can contribute to upgrading the rice supply chain and the development of the rice sector in Benin. Promoting and supporting the spread of contract-farming schemes in the sector might be an effective way to contribute to reaching the government goals of expanding rice production to become self-sufficient and improving rice quality to compete with imported rice. While there is a large empirical literature on contract-farming in high-value and commodity export sectors, studies on contract-farming in staple food sectors are very scarce. Our results document that contract-farming for staple food crops can be sustainable and benefit smallholder farmers; which is against theoretical expectations that contracting for staple food crops is not feasible because of contract-enforcement problems that stem from a low value of produce, low storage and transport costs, and a larger number of buyers in the chain. Our study contributes to understanding the role that contract-farming might play in the much needed upgrading of domestic and staple food crop sectors in developing countries.

N2  - This article explores the processes whereby control over land and water is exercised in the context of commercial shrimp cultivation in coastal Bangladesh. The authors draw on the insight that the exercise of control over resources implies both inclusion for some and exclusion for others, and that shifting the boundary between the two involves the deployment of four interacting 'powers of exclusion'--regulation, the market, force, and legitimation--the effectiveness of which depends on specific historical conjunctures. The article uses a case study of a village in Khulna District to explore: (a) the processes by which poor farmers were excluded from their land by large shrimp farmers; (b) the ways in which villagers experienced the changes in land use and social relations associated with the shrimp boom; and (c) the conjunction of internal and external factors that enabled smallholders to collectively mobilize to reverse their exclusion from the land. Understanding these messy and contingent processes of exclusion and counter-exclusion helps to inform strategies aimed at securing the property rights and livelihoods of the rural poor.

N2  - Technologies like improved breeds of dairy cows and improved forages have the potential to significantly increase dairy cow productivity and farmers' profits in developing countries. However, adoption of such technologies has been low in Ethiopia, despite numerous efforts to disseminate the technologies in the past. Some studies argue that adoption of technologies is low because welfare effects of the technologies could be insignificant or negative to certain groups of farmers. This article employed propensity score matching and inverse probability weighting estimator with regression adjustment to examine the difference in household nutrition and income between adopters and nonadopters of dairy technologies in rural Ethiopia. We find that adoption of cross-bred dairy cows and improved forages increases household nutrition and income. The significant household nutrition and income impact for adopters support the notion that many Ethiopian smallholders have not adopted dairy technologies because adopters and nonadopters of dairy technologies have inherent differences in welfare outcome potentials. The results suggest that interventions that enhance access to farm resources and address barriers to input and output value chains could improve adoption of dairy technologies.

N2  - The aim of this paper is to analyze the emerging entrepreneurial practices on family farms in two agrarian reform cooperatives in Morocco. Their emergence can be explained by the constant negotiation of multiple and sometimes even antagonistic logics within these farms in a context of rapid agrarian change and the juxtaposition of capitalistic, entrepreneurial and peasant farms in the same area. Through their engagement as workers or sharecroppers in the different types of farms and as household members on the family farm, the young farmers from the dismantled agrarian cooperatives participate actively in the transformation of farming modes. The porosity of the peasant and entrepreneurial worlds is the main lesson we draw from our study. There is a subtle process of hybridization between the peasant and entrepreneurial modes of farming, resulting in a wide range of profiles. If we only focus on the political discourse, the trend towards capitalistic and entrepreneurial modes of farming seems inescapable. Nevertheless, our study stresses the resistance of peasant modes of farming that can blend with a 'modern' perception of agriculture.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the market structure and value chain of pearl millet grain and fodder in India. There is a decline in demand for human consumption, with an increase in demand for non-food uses like cattle and poultry feed, raw material for starch and breweries industry. This paper explores alternative channels, uses and value chains of pearl millet grain and fodder. The paper examines in what ways small farmers can benefit from the evolving alternative uses for pearl millet grain in cattle and poultry feed industry, breweries and starch industry. The paper also analyses the impact of aggregators in increasing the efficiency of the value chain. Design/methodology/approach: The study collected primary data from farmers, traders, commission agents and exporters and importers with innovative marketing channels with aggregators (Self-Help Groups) and without aggregators to analyze the prospects for improvements in marketing channels and value chain. Findings: Given that the production of pearl millet is scattered and thin, there is a lot of scope for market aggregators to increase scale economies to reduce market costs to supply in bulk to food and industrial uses. Although there was some demand for human consumption high-quality grain, most of the future demand will come from cattle and poultry feed industry, breweries and starch industry. To tap these larger potentials, farmers need to aggregate their produce and ensure regular supply in bulk quantity at least to compete the cost with alternative grains like maize and broken rice.

N2  - Cooperatives are established to improve farmers' production conditions, to increase their bargaining power and to enable them to benefit from modern value chains. In China, farmers are members of a cooperative for multiple reasons. Little is known on whether and how cooperative membership affects farmers' choice of marketing channels. This paper examines determinants of farmers' choice of marketing channels, especially how cooperative membership impacts upon this choice. Our analysis is based on survey data collected in 2015 among 625 apple growing farm households in the provinces Shaanxi and Shandong. We employ endogenous switching probit models to deal with potential endogeneity of membership in estimating the determinants of marketing channel choices. We find that cooperative membership has a positive impact on selling to wholesalers and a negative impact on selling to small dealers, but no significant impact on selling to the cooperative itself. As products sold through cooperatives generally comply with relatively stringent food quality and safety standards, these results imply that policies promoting cooperative members to sell their products through cooperatives are likely to have a significant impact on food quality and food safety in China.

N2  - The early 2000s witnessed a global awareness on adoption of renewable and environmentally friendly energy with anticipated socio-economic benefits in developing countries. Jatropha curcas. L. (Jatropha) was the main bioenergy crop adopted for production under out-grower schemes in Zambia. However, recent studies report worldwide abandonment of Jatropha production. This study therefore investigated factors responsible for the abandonment of Jatropha production under out-grower schemes in Chibombo District, Zambia. A total of 110 smallholder farmers who participated in these out-grower schemes and one key informant were selected using snowball sampling. Primary data was collected using field observations and a cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire administered through face-to-face interviews. Findings reveal that abandonment of Jatropha production was mainly driven by lack of market for the produce, and non-commitment of the sponsoring firm to contractual agreements under the out-grower schemes. Thus, more than 90% of the farmers did not earn income from the sale of Jatropha. To achieve optimal performance of these out-grower schemes, a supporting policy environment and legal framework enforcing compliance to contractual agreements are required. Further, such should be accompanied by creation of market opportunities for the crop as well as its price regulation.

N2  - This paper analyses the link between gender differences and different activities along the cowpea value chain as well as food security and asset-based poverty using a recent cross-sectional data set of over 120 farm households in Eastern Zambia. We used the endogenous switching probit regression model to account for both observed and unobserved heterogeneity. Results show that women's participation in the cowpea value chain significantly increases cowpea production, marketing and adoption of improved cowpea varieties. It also reduces both food insecurity and poverty. However, women's participation in the value chain is limited by low levels of education, access to extension, credit, village markets, and improved agricultural technologies. Policies to address these constraints that limit women's participation in the cowpea value chain have the potential to reduce gender disparities, food insecurity, and poverty.

N2  - In this article, we develop a dynamic model to show how membership in agricultural cooperatives influences smallholder farmers' decisions to invest in organic soil amendments and chemical fertilizer. The model considers management decisions of heterogenous producers within an intertemporal framework, with the decision to join the cooperative assumed to be endogenous. Farm-level data of apple farmers from three provinces in China are used to estimate the impact of cooperative membership on investment in organic soil amendments and chemical fertilizer. A recursive bivariate probit model that accounts for potential endogeneity of cooperative membership and selection bias is employed in the empirical analysis. The empirical results show that cooperative membership exerts a positive and statistically significant impact on the likelihood of investing in organic soil amendments. The findings also reveal that tenure security, human capital, farm size, and access to credit positively and significantly influence the probability of a farmer joining a cooperative and the likelihood of investing in soil quality measures.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how various transaction-cost characteristics influence the choice of vertical coordination (VC) structures (e.g. different contract types) and horizontal coordination (HC) structures (e.g. different farmer organization types) to link smallholder farmers efficiently with buyers. It analyzes the relationship between vertical and horizontal structures, and the economic sustainability of different structure combinations. Design/methodology/approach: The paper develops a conceptual framework to predict coordination structures as a function of transaction-cost characteristics, compares predictions for the Malian cereals market to empirical evidence using 15 case studies, and then analyzes structure combinations. Findings: Asymmetric scale between farmers and buyers; uncertainty in production, prices, policy, and contract enforcement; and quality and quantity debasement lead to selections of structures with high levels of control. Vertical and horizontal structures demonstrate a complementary relationship in certain core coordination roles, while exhibiting substitutability in the provision of other coordination activities. The marketing cooperative and marketing contract pairing is the most prevalent combination.

N2  - Linking smallholder farmers to large enterprises could be a powerful mechanism to improve input and output markets as well as other productivity-enhancing services for liquidity constrained smallholders. Dairy hubs promoted by the East African Dairy Development project are collective farmer-owned milk bulking and/or chilling plants through which farmers get access to output markets and inputs as well as other services necessary for their dairy enterprises. The hubs act as a linkage between large processors and smallholder dairy farmers. They enable farmers to supply milk to large dairy processors who are emerging key players in the East African dairy industry. In addition to the different forms of linkages with large processors, these hubs also differ in their level of growth toward sustainability. In light of this background, this work aims to provide evidence on the effects, at farm level, of different types of linkages between smallholder dairy farmers and large processors through dairy hubs. The study uses cross-sectional survey data collected from 993 smallholder livestock keeping households living within the dairy hubs' catchment areas in Kenya and Uganda. Statistical tests on technical efficiency estimates from dairy farm enterprises were conducted in order to provide evidence of the effects of the types of processor linkages on the performance of the dairy farm enterprises. The results provide evidence of no strong influence at farm levels that can be attributed to different forms of linkages with the processor that dairy hubs adopt. Moreover, though hub sustainability is directly linked to the producer organization's efficiency level, our results show that it does not sufficiently translate to more productive farmers. These findings call for concerted efforts by development agents in the dairy sector, policy makers, and even large processors to intervene in order to support improved farm performance. As evidenced from the study, one direct policy tool at the disposal of these agents is extension messages.

N2  - Contracts between companies and local communities have been used in Indonesia for over 20years to involve smallholder farmers in the emerging palm oil industry. Impacts of these contracts have not been analyzed systematically. Here, data from a village survey, spanning a time period from 1992 to 2012, are used to evaluate effects on rural economic development. Panel regression models with village fixed effects show that contracts have significantly contributed to wealth accumulation. Contracts signed before 1999 were more beneficial than contracts signed afterward, which is due to more public sector support and infrastructure investments during the earlier period. Contracts have contributed to decreasing inter-village inequality, not only because poorer villages were more likely to adopt a contract, but also because they benefited more from contract adoption than richer ones. The results suggest that well-designed contracts can be important for smallholder farmers to benefit from the oil palm boom. The village-level approach has clear advantages to evaluate direct and indirect economic effects, but it also has drawbacks in terms of analyzing environmental effects and issues of intra-village inequality. More research with various approaches is needed to better understand the multifaceted implications of oil palm contracts for sustainable rural development.

N2  - It is agreed that agriculture provides avenues for impoverished households to produce and trade their way out of poverty. However, this requires market access and value chain integration of small-scale farmers. This paper explores the possibilities for integration of small-scale farmers into the mainstream commercial broiler value chain in South Africa. Production costs of small-scale producers are evaluated within the context of their commercial counterparts, with a case study approach. It revealed that small-scale producers pay more for inputs but also receive a substantial premium for sales of live birds in the informal market. This results in attractive gross margins for small-scale producers. There is, however, a production ceiling, due to demand and production considerations, associated with small-scale broiler production. This ultimately results in a dualistic industry with an informal (live sale) value chain at the one end of the spectrum and a sophisticated large-scale commercial value chain at the other. Given the salient production features and investment requirements associated with large-scale broiler production, organic growth from the small-scale value chain into the commercial value chain seems improbable. The dual nature of this industry should therefore be considered when developing policy geared towards development, poverty alleviation, and value chain integration.

N2  - Organic agriculture can sustain rural development and ease poverty. However, whether it could be a viable pathway to improve the livelihoods of small-scale farmers in the context of urbanisation and demographic change has been less studied. To understand this, household surveys were conducted in 2007 and 2014 in Wanzai, Jiangxi Province China, where organic farming started in 2000. The results show that organic farming did contribute to higher farm incomes for small-scale farmers (<1 ha land) compared to those practicing conventional agriculture, regardless of whether the profitability is measured on a per land unit or per household basis. The annual farmers household net income increased from 2007 to 2014, however, the farm income of small-scale farmers only makes up a minor part of total household income and its percentage becomes less and less over time. For medium-scale organic farmers (>1 ha land), the proportion of income from farming was higher (56% in 2007 and 77% in 2014), leading to average farm incomes of USD 16,108 in 2014. Among organic farmers, cooperatives members performed better economically than those not in cooperatives. Organic agriculture can ensure stable and sustainable alternative livelihoods, especially in a situation where available land offers opportunities for scaling up.

N2  - Based on 1251 household surveys collected in photovoltaic (PV) poverty alleviation areas in rural China, this paper explores the effects of PV cognition including ecological values, perceived behavioural control and social factors on household energy use behaviour by using binary logit regression. The results indicate that: (1) off-farm employment is an important factor influencing household energy choice by reducing the probability of using traditional fossil fuels and increasing the probability of using clean energy; (2) life skills or literacy training and farmers' cooperatives are beneficial to promoting the use of solar energy, and democratic participation and power supply stability can also promote the use of clean energy, so as to reduce the use of traditional fossil fuels; (3) ecological values and perceived behavioural control have no significant impact on the use of solar energy but show significant positive effects on energy-saving behaviour.

N2  - This article evaluates household welfare effects of large-scale agricultural investments in Tanzania, one of the main recipients of such investments in Africa. Specifically, the article compares households participating in sugar and rice investments through outgrower schemes or as agro-industry workers with non-participants in terms of household income and income poverty. Building on primary household data, it is one of the first studies to empirically analyze ex-post impacts of large-scale agricultural investments in Africa. The analysis draws on cross-section survey data of 516 households collected in Kilombero District, a priority cluster for the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT). The results show overall positive household welfare differences between participants of the investments and the respective counterfactual. However, there are large differences between arrangements and subsectors. Estimated effects for outgrowers are largest, yet for land-rich outgrowers more so than for land-poor. Effects for agro-industry workers in the sugar investment are significantly larger than for those in the rice investment, though in both investments land-poor workers seem to benefit. Hence, the study results suggest potential benefits of outgrower schemes and potentials of agro-industry wage employment for the land-poor to escape extreme poverty. Yet, it also stresses particularly the need to address the constraints of land-poor outgrowers. Qualitative interviews, for example, pointed to growing risks for land-poor outgrowers in the context of rising elite capture by larger outgrowers.

N2  - Supermarkets have gained in importance in the food systems of many developing countries, with profound implications for smallholder farmers. Several studies analyzed effects of selling to supermarkets on smallholder productivity and income. However, no previous work systematically analyzed effects of supermarkets on farmgate prices, even though prices are important determinants of farmers' profits and livelihoods. Here, we use data from smallholder vegetable growers in India to compare output prices received in supermarket and traditional market channels. We also quantify farmers' transport and transaction costs in both channels. Even after controlling for quality differences, prices are significantly higher in supermarket channels. Positive price effects are confirmed through hedonic price models and propensity score matching. Average effects of supermarkets on farmgate prices are in a magnitude of 20% or more. Higher farmgate prices are due to fewer intermediaries and lower transaction costs in supermarket channels. In the absence of binding contracts, supermarkets also need to pay higher prices to ensure regular supply of high-quality vegetables. These results suggest that the rise of supermarkets can contribute to increased market efficiency with positive effects on farmgate prices and revenues.

N2  - The Chinese government faces a great challenge to safeguard the safety of the food supply chain due to the significant fragmentation of producers and weak institutional resources to monitor and enforce safety standards. Food safety in China has received escalating attention since the 2008 milk scandal. Mainly due to safety concerns, Chinese farmers adopt two separate production systems for the market and self-consumption, and thus, the so-called "One Farm Household, Two Production Systems" (OFH-TPS) has gained popularity in the recent years. This study provides a theoretical framework to examine how product inspections and certifications affect the OFH-TPS adoption by mitigating information asymmetry of product quality. It also shows that both food safety concerns and cost savings are important factors for famers' decision on the adoption. The empirical analysis finds that product inspections conducted by firms, agricultural cooperatives, and farmers curb the OFH-TPS adoption, whereas government inspections have no statistically significant effect. Farmers who grow "Green Food" are less likely but organic farmers are more likely to adopt the OFH-TPS. We also find that pesticide use training curbs the OFH-TPS adoption, and the perceived adverse effects of pesticide use to the environment and human health have no statistical effect. Farmers who use highly toxic or banned pesticides and/or who perceive food safety at the local markets is poor are more likely to adopt the OFH-TPS. This study provides rich policy implications. To safeguard food safety, it is critical to engage the private sector for co-regulation, improve the efficacy of government inspections, and promote education on pesticide use to both farmers as well as retailers of pesticides.

N2  - The Chinese Government has increased its focus on expanding farm scale to promote agricultural development since 2010. A series of favorable polices has been adopted to support large-scale farming. Using a multivariate probit model and 2015 and 2016 rural household survey data, the present paper examines the factors that influence small farmers' decision to become large-scale farmers. The empirical regression results suggest that the decision to become a large-scale farmer is significantly influenced by household human capital, cooperative membership, marketing channels, land-transfer contracts, and government policies. However, the influence of these factors differs with respect to becoming large-scale grain and non-grain farmers. These results imply that policy tools should target these factors and the appropriate group of small-scale farmers. Generally, both central and local governments should promote large-scale farming by enhancing rural households' human capital, improving marketing channels, and providing agricultural social services, as well as encouraging returning migrant workers to engage in large-scale farming.

N2  - The domestic mango value chain in Indonesia is transforming rapidly. This article examines the triangle of linkages among farmers' participation in modernising markets, the emerging use of outsourced services by sprayer-traders (STs), and farm technology intensification. The key findings are as follows. First, small farmers--not just larger farmers--participate in modernising markets. However, the participation is by the upper tier of small farmers, defined in non-land asset terms. Second, although both small and larger farmers use STs, the strongest determinant of use of an ST is the interaction between having non-farm employment (thus, demand for substitution for own labour on the farm) and having a medium-sized commercial farm (thus, demand for skilled agronomic services). Farmers in mango cluster areas also tend to use STs. Finally, use of STs and participation in modernising markets spur farming intensification through the use of modern inputs.

N2  - As the result of prohibitively high transaction costs, smallholder farmers are only partly integrated into agricultural and forest commodity markets, a situation that may leave them in a lower level of development equilibrium (i.e., a poverty trap). For the most part, many users of forest commons extract forest products, typically non-timber products, for subsistence use or safety net purposes. To overcome this problem, in recent years, collective vertical integration (VI) of forest product marketing cooperative structures have been promoted and, in some cases, adopted by users of forest commons. Although this type of program has been observed to raise smallholder incomes, there is little evidence available on saving/investment responses to such income gains. This paper investigates precautionary saving and investment responses to collective forest product marketing programs among users of forest commons in Ethiopian villages. To identify the causal effects of the program, I applied propensity score matching, difference-in-difference (DID) and change-in-change (CIC) estimators to household survey data collected from randomly selected households in the Gimbo district (south-western Ethiopia). I find strong evidence that participation in the program reduces savings in the form of livestock holdings and that effect is limited to non-poor households. When interpreted in terms of the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH), the results imply that participants felt the current income gains to be non-transient, which led to reduced precautionary savings and to a gain in consumption/welfare. Moreover, I found that the program has spurred investment in child education and participation in off-farm self-employment. These results point to the importance of the safety net/insurance channel of the program. Overall, the findings underscore the program's potential to raise the standard of living via ancillary mechanisms beyond directly raising income outcome.

N2  - It is often assumed that voluntary sustainability standards--such as Fairtrade--could not only improve the socioeconomic wellbeing of smallholder farmers in developing countries but could also help to reduce negative health and environmental impacts of agricultural production. The empirical evidence is thin, as most previous studies on the impact of sustainability standards only focused on economic indicators, such as prices, yields, and incomes. Here, we argue that Fairtrade and other sustainability standards can affect agrochemical input use through various mechanisms with possible positive and negative health and environmental effects. We use data from farmers and rural workers in Cote d'Ivoire to analyze effects of Fairtrade certification on fertilizer and pesticide use, as well as on human health and environmental toxicity. Fairtrade increases chemical input quantities and aggregated levels of toxicity. Nevertheless, Fairtrade reduces the incidence of pesticide-related acute health symptoms among farmers and workers. Certified cooperatives are more likely to offer training and other services related to the safe handling of pesticides and occupational health, which can reduce negative externalities in spite of higher input quantities. These results suggest that simplistic assumptions about the health and environmental effects of sustainability standards may be inappropriate.

N2  - In recent decades, China undertook a series of agricultural land tenure reforms to increase the security of land use rights for rural households. While these reforms boosted agricultural production, they also increased landlessness among women due to patrilocal and patrilineal customs. Utilising data from China's Women Social Status Survey conducted in 2010, this paper examines the impact of women's land rights on the incidence of domestic violence in rural China. The results show that women who have lost claims to contract land or have no residential land face significantly higher risks of being physically or psychologically abused by their husbands.

N2  - The livestock sector plays a significant role in the rural economy of India. It helps to mitigate poverty as it is more equally distributed than land among different socio-economic classes. The present paper is based on a primary survey undertaken in Bhatsana village of district Rewari, Haryana to study the trends in livestock holdings and the relationship between land and livestock holdings. Using poisson regression analysis, it also examines the determinants of number of bovine animal holdings of the household. We find that despite great significance of this sector towards poverty alleviation, a large number of economically poor and socially backward classes face credit constraint to invest in purchasing livestock such as cattle and buffaloes. The concern is that, a large percentage of rural households have limited access to land, capital, information, technology and markets even if they have sufficient labour and may not be able to reap benefit of an increasing demand for milk and dairy products. On the other hand, medium and large farmers, despite having enough fodder availability face constraints in terms of labour availability. In the presence of these constraints, it is interesting to note that in the survey village there exists an informal arrangement in livestock holdings, namely rental markets that affect the flow of livestock holdings of the households. The existence of such informal rental markets enables landless and small farmers to buy/sell or lease in livestock but at the same time leads to their exploitation. The paper also suggests the role of state policies for the development of this sector.

N2  - Food systems in developing countries are changing rapidly with a growing role of modern supermarkets. Supermarkets influence supply chains and the way agricultural products are sourced from farmers. Especially for the procurement of fresh fruits and vegetables, supermarkets often contract farmers directly to ensure consistent and high-quality supply. One important question, which is addressed here, is whether smallholder farmers benefit from supermarket contracts. Previous studies address this question, but mostly focus on income effects without exploring implications for other dimensions of household welfare, such as nutrition, health, or housing conditions. Moreover, most existing studies rely on cross-section data. We add to the literature by analyzing effects of supermarket contracts on income and multidimensional poverty using three rounds of panel data collected from smallholder vegetable farmers in Kenya and econometric models with household fixed effects. On average, supermarket contracts increase household income by over 40%. We also find significant reductions in income poverty and multidimensional poverty. Quantile regressions show that farmers in all income groups benefit, but richer households benefit more than poorer ones in absolute terms. However, supermarket contracts cause the strongest reductions in multidimensional deprivations among the poorest households.

N2  - We adopt a complementary methods approach to investigate whether and how heterogeneity in individual returns to a public good affects public good provision. We engage smallholder farmers in Sri Lanka in: a one-shot, framed, lab-in-the-field experiment, within which the farmers' rates of return to the public good are exogenously varied; and a survey including a question about the farmers' willingness to contribute time to the construction of a specific hypothetical public good, the return from which, for a given farmer, would depend on his or her circumstances in everyday life. In the former, we find weak evidence that heterogeneity in individual returns increases contributions. In the latter we find that those facing a higher return would contribute more, but no evidence that heterogeneity has an effect, either way, at the group-level. We conclude that heterogeneity in returns does not explain why collective action remains a challenge in farming communities in developing countries. From a methodological point of view, we find that using complementary methods provides a more balanced account of communities' potential engagement in public good provision.

Four hundred and forty (440) producers were selected through the use of purposive and simple random sampling techniques. Propensity Score Matching and descriptive statistics were used for the analysis. The results showed that, small scale rice producers who were part of the outgrower scheme had an average increase of productivity from 0.641 bags of rice/acre to 0.689 bags/acre compared to those who did not benefit from the project. Furthermore, small scale rice producers in the Volta Region who partook in outgrower scheme had increased average annual income between GH cents 1810 and GH cents 2608 than those who did not partake in outgrower scheme.

N2  - Through two rounds of land contracting, rural households have been allocated a bundle of rights in land. We observe significant differences across villages in the amount of land to which villagers retain a claim and the institutional mechanisms governing the exchange of land rights. This study reveals the perpetuation and expansion of non-market mechanisms accruing to the benefit of village cadres and state officials and only limited emergence of market mechanisms in which households are primary beneficiaries. It identifies factors in economic, political and legal domains that incentivize and enable state officials and local cadres to capture returns from use of land. Relatedly, the study finds differences in conflict over property-rights regimes. Drawing on a pilot survey carried out by the authors in November of 2011 in Shaanxi and Jiangsu provinces (192 households in 24 villages), this paper seeks to explain heterogeneity and change in property-rights regimes over time and across space.

N2  - We explore the impact of a rural agricultural value chain project in Liberia on smallholder farmers, their households and children in order to better understand the link between household economic welfare and child wellbeing. Drawing on longitudinal field-based quasi-experimental survey data, we estimate the causal effect of the project on the use of modern farming techniques and production, household assets and food security, and child education, health and nutrition. Mixed-methods include multiple rounds of focus groups with farmers, key informant interviews with community leaders, and project monitoring farmer diaries. Treatment farmers showed increased use of modern farming techniques and improved production, households experienced greater access to food, and while no significant changes were found for children, for the outcomes of interest, treatment children outcomes trended in the positive direction. The evaluation suggests that participation in agricultural value chain interventions contributes to positive farm outcomes and social assets, but economic-focused activities alone are insufficient to improve children's lives. Since improving the lives of children from birth is critical to breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty, economic strengthening programs like value chain interventions, must monitor their effects on children: to do no harm and to identify and take advantage of opportunities to improve the lives of children.

N2  - Nepal's population continues to grow, but the agricultural sector's performance remains almost stagnant. This has led to a decline in the per capita availability of food. Increasing agricultural productivity is the key to agricultural growth, and one strategy for increasing agricultural productivity is to use improved seeds. This study investigates the impact of contract farming (CF) in high yielding varieties (HYV) of paddy seed production on costs, yield, and profits of smallholder farms in Nepal. Using farm-level data and a non-parametric propensity score matching estimator, the study finds a significant positive impact of contract HYV seed farming on revenues, profits, and yield, and a significant negative impact on total costs of production. Additionally, very small farms (=<0.43 ha) with CF in HYV paddy seeds tend to gain the most when it comes to yield per hectare. Our estimates reveal that the average smallholder household in Nepal engaged in CF with input conditions receives higher profits. However, farmers engaged in CF with output conditions tend to have higher yields but smaller profits. Finally, farmers engaged in CF in HYV paddy seeds with both input and output conditions have the highest yield gains and significantly higher profits.

N2  - Biofuels often raise the specter of food insecurity, water resource depletion, and greenhouse gas emissions from land clearing. These concerns underpin the "sustainability criteria" governing access to European biofuel markets. However, it is unclear if producing biofuels in low-income countries does exacerbate poverty and food insecurity, and moreover, whether the sustainability criteria should apply to all agricultural exports entering European markets. We develop an integrated modeling framework to simultaneously assess the economic and environmental impacts of producing biofuels in Malawi. We incorporate the effects of land use change on crop water use, and the opportunity costs of using scarce resources for biofuels instead of other crops. We find that biofuel production reduces poverty and food insecurity by raising household incomes. Irrigated outgrower schemes, rather than estate farms, lead to better economic outcomes, fewer emissions, and similar water requirements. Nevertheless, to gain access to European markets, Malawi would need to reduce emissions from ethanol plants. We find that biofuels' economic and emissions outcomes are generally preferable to tobacco or soybeans. We conclude that the sustainability criteria encourage more sustainable biofuel production in countries like Malawi, but are perhaps overly biased against biofuels since other export crops raise similar concerns about food security and environmental impacts.

N2  - We analyze the efficiency of wheat farmers toward the ever-increasing demand for wheat in Tanzania. Translog production and cost functions were utilized in the stochastic frontier analysis to examine technical, allocative, and economic efficiencies (TE, AE, and EE) of wheat farmers in Northern Tanzania. Propensity score matching through caliper radius and nearest neighbor methods were utilized to analyze the impact of value chain participation on smallholder farm efficiency levels. Analysis revealed that the average TE, AE, and EE scores for farmers' value chain participation were 79%, 80%, and 64%, respectively, in the study area, implying that wheat farmers could still improve their level of TE, AE, and EE by 21%, 20%, and 36%, respectively. Caliper radius matching revealed that the net effects of farmers' participation in vertical coordination on TE, AE, and EE were 6.8%, 5.7%, and 8.7%, respectively, while the net effects of farmers' horizontal coordination participation were 6.3%, 9.5%, and 11.6%, respectively. This indicates that farmers' participation in value chain (vertical and horizontal coordination) would positively impact their level of wheat farm efficiencies. Based on the results, we recommend the expansion of wheat plots and use of modern farming technologies to increase wheat production in Tanzania. To further improve farm unit efficiency, we recommend additional formal education for future farmers, more on-farm extension training, and participation in the value chain through contracts and farmers' associations.

N2  - Farmer cooperatives may promote technology adoption in agricultural production, which, in turn, increases crop productivity and farmers' income. However, empirical evidence of how and to what extent cooperatives facilitate the technology adoption extensity, defined as the number of technologies adopted by a farmer from a wide range of agricultural technologies, remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we examine the impact of cooperative membership on the technology adoption extensity using cross-sectional data collected from 413 farm households in Sichuan province of China. We use propensity score matching combined with an instrumental variable approach to address the sample selection bias associated with voluntary cooperative membership choice. The statistical results suggest that cooperative membership has a positive effect on the technology adoption extensity when all 13 surveyed technologies are considered. However, the separate analyses on the adoption of production and post-harvest technologies reveal that cooperative membership has an insignificant impact on the number of adopted production technologies, but it significantly increases the number of post-harvest technologies adopted. These empirical findings are in line with the new institutional economics theories and our observations on the ground.

N2  - Contract farming is often seen as a panacea for many of the challenges faced by agricultural production in developing countries. Given the large heterogeneity of contract farming arrangements, it is debatable whether all kinds of contract farming arrangements offer benefits to participating smallholders. Nonetheless, many donor agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and governments of developing countries are increasingly pushing for contract farming and outgrower schemes as an instrument to commercialize small-scale farming. Their desire for such arrangements is further reinforced by the recent rush for large-scale agricultural land acquisition in most developing countries, often described as "land grabbing," because contract farming and outgrower schemes can result in the same advantages as large-scale farming, but avoid its main drawback--namely the displacement of the current land-users. Using data from the oldest and some more recently established sugarcane outgrower schemes in Ethiopia, this paper examines the effects of compulsory participation in sugarcane outgrower production on total household income and asset stocks. Because outgrowers and non-outgrowers may have some differences prior to joining sugarcane outgrower schemes, we use genetic matching and propensity score matching to make the two groups comparable based on their observable characteristics. Our results indicate that compulsory participation in an outgrower scheme significantly reduces the income and asset stocks of outgrowers who contributed irrigated land to the outgrower scheme, while the effect is insignificant for outgrowers who contributed rain-fed land. We provide several explanations and discuss policy implications.

N2  - This article presents field research data on a smallholder maize crop boom in Shan State, northern Myanmar, and its spatially uneven dispossessory effects. Local research teams studied eight villages, four in the north and an equal number in the south of Shan State, using focus group discussions and randomized household interviews, supplemented with key informant interviews. This study deepens the global land grab debate by highlighting the role of smallholder cash crop booms in "smaller-scale" land grabs that have been shown to be significant drivers of agrarian transformation, especially in Southeast Asia. The article builds on the conceptualization of "accumulation from below" by accounting for the geographically differentiated processes of dispossession from smallholder contract farming arrangements, its variant forms of coercion and consent, and the political contingencies that give rise to and help explain uneven agrarian change. The study's findings demonstrate how political contingency shapes spatial patterns of accumulation and dispossession through regional and local variations in the politics of ethnic identity, migration, insurgency and an illicit drugs economy. These political dynamics inform the hierarchy of power and cultural familiarity between smallholders and local state-supported "silent strongmen", in this case town moneylenders and village elites, which--together with several other identified factors, especially the poppy economy--influence the spatial distribution of dispossession. Neither extra-economic coercion within orbits of state power nor simply accumulation from below by market opportunities adequately explains uneven agrarian transformation. Instead, the analytical frame on forms of violence in capital accumulation should be expanded and deepened in order to better capture the complex coming together of violence, coercion and consent that is geographically specific, and taken together is more than the sum of their parts.

N2  - The implementation of the green economy in Tanzania is currently re-arranging space in significant ways. The Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT) has been presented by the government as well as investors and aid donors as a model for the green economy in Africa combining investments in large-scale farming with environmental conservation. The Kilombero valley is centrally situated within SAGCOT and has become a national hotspot of land-use conflicts. The valley is dominated by an expanding sector of agricultural capital investments combined with a substantial increase in areas under environmental conservation. While some smallholder farmers are dispossessed through these expansions, others are contracted as outgrowers. Pastoralists are, however, only in the way, and are also thought to cause widespread environmental degradation. This is a long-held view, which also plays a key role in the implementation of SAGCOT. It has led to a series of pastoral evictions in the country. In 2012, 'Operation Save Kilombero' was implemented consisting of violent evictions of all pastoralists from the valley. This eviction had been planned to conserve the wetland ecosystem that was seen by the government and aid donors to be threatened by pastoral overstocking. The arrival of the green economy in Kilombero re-enforced the perceived need to clear the valley of livestock and pastoralists to conserve the environment and make space for investments in agriculture. The pastoral eviction in Kilombero in 2012 was also only one in a series; every eviction leading to the spill-over of pastoralists to other areas creating new farmer-herder conflicts as well as conservation conflicts. While land-use conflicts in Africa are commonly thought to be caused by natural resource scarcity and environmental degradation mainly resulting from population growth, we demonstrate how degradation narratives may themselves be a key driver of conflicts, in this case to legitimize and pave the way for agricultural investments and environmental conservation under a 'green economy'.

N2  - The growth of organic food and drinks sector, higher than that of the conventional market, creates niche market opportunities mainly in developed countries. Organic certification is promoted in developing countries as a valuable export alternative, as well as a solution to environmental and health problems related to chemical input use. Organic products earn a premium price on the international market compared to conventional products. Hence, shifting from conventional to organic production might be an opportunity for small-scale farmers to reap high returns from their investments. Since switching to organic production requires adjustments of production techniques as well as the costs of the certification itself, several aspects need to be considered when determining its profitability. Using the pineapple sector in Ghana as an example, this paper sheds light on the feasibility and profitability of organic small-scale production. The literature so far has looked income effects on small scale farmers and price premia at consumer level. We provide the missing link between these papers by showing how the premium for organic produce at the farm level is formed, how it translates into profits and how it develops along the value chain. In doing so, the paper also has to set a focus to the specific conditions in Ghana, where the pineapple industry, once flourishing, has faced a crisis after 2005. With regard to donor efforts to bring back smallholders into export production, it is central to know if this is a viable possibility in Ghana. Analyzing costs and price formation along the fresh pineapple value chain, we find that production for the export market is a realistic option for both organic and conventional small-scale pineapple farmers. Second, the results suggest a positive effect of switching from conventional to organic production when competing on the global market for pineapple. Among smallholder farms, organic production is more advantageous than conventional production. Our findings also suggest that a considerable share of the organic price premium is passed from retail level to Ghanaian farmers. Nevertheless, other factors such as contract enforcement costs and standard compliance may hinder farmers from successfully participating in export markets.

N2  - This study investigates the impact of direct grain subsidy and off-farm labor supply on farmland leasing options in China, using multinomial logit and farm household-level data. Results show that the grain subsidy has a significant and positive effect on both leasing out and leasing in farmland in rural China. Rural households with an increased share of full-time off-farm workers are more likely to lease out farmland and less likely to lease it in. Older operators and households with less educational attainment are less likely to lease in farmland. Large farms are likely to both lease out and lease in farmland. Finally, the Land Shareholding Cooperative System (LSCS) plays an important role in China's farmland leasing market.

N2  - Pro-poor value chains intend to integrate smallholding farmers into high value markets to contribute to poverty alleviation and food security. Although income benefits of pro-poor value chains have been found, scant evidence exists regarding the potential for these markets to enhance food security. This study focuses on components of food access--dietary diversity, physical and financial access, and social acceptability--among households that participate in pro-poor value chains and non-participating households in the central highlands of Peru where development interventions have created high value market niches for the native potato varieties that smallholding farmers have conserved for thousands of years. Using a mixed methods approach, this study assessed dietary diversity among households that participate and do not participate in pro-poor value chains, as well as their perceptions of their food access. Findings indicated that households that participate in value chains have higher dietary diversity than non-participating households but that these differences are likely due to pre-existing differences in socioeconomic status rather than any causal effect provided by value chains. The study also concluded that while participation in pro-poor value chains sometimes enhance the purchasing power of participating households, they may also weaken financial access, important for both purchasing food and travel to make those purchases. Community perspectives also indicated concerns with the acceptability of diets, which cannot likely be comprehensively addressed by pro-poor value chains. Collectively, the findings from this study cast doubt on the assumption that a linear flow exists between pro-poor value chains and enhanced food access.

N2  - Policies which redistribute property rights to land can improve the well-being of rural households and can have overall growth effects. In many cases, however, land reforms are driven mainly by politically justified objectives. Under such circumstances, little emphasis is placed on whether and, if so, how property rights can increase productivity. Following 18 years of land reform implementation in Namibia, we evaluated 65 beneficiaries in Namibia. We assess to which degree land rights affects their farm income. The study focuses on Namibia's two main commercial land reform instruments, namely the Farm Unit Resettlement Scheme and the Affirmative Action Loan Scheme. We find evidence that the majority of land reform projects are not profitable. Further, our study confirms the importance of the right to restrict land access compared with the right to transfer. The long-term leasehold contract seemingly provides sufficient incentives to make productive use of the land.

N2  - Can Fairtrade certification improve farmers' livelihoods in small-scale coffee farming tribal communities in India? Has Fairtrade contributed to capacity-building among the farmers? To answer these questions, household data of 256 coffee farmers from a tribal coffee-producing community in southern India was collected in 2010. Using the propensity score matching technique, the empirical findings show that Fairtrade certification has a positive impact on farmers' income. However, the incidence of poverty in the community is very high, with 84% of the certified farmers being extremely poor. Some improvement in the livelihoods of certified farmers has occurred from higher and assured farm gate prices, regular collection of coffee from the village centers that reduces travel costs, and from the social Fairtrade premium. But while the benefits are modest and the process is slow, challenges remain in terms of improving the effectiveness and management of the cooperative system, as well as raising the awareness of farmers about Fairtrade certification. There is a need to strengthen the positive impacts created by Fairtrade certification by collaboration between the cooperative and local government to enhance the technical, financial and human capacities of the coffee cooperative members.

N2  - With the modernization of global agri-food systems, the role of contract farming increases. This also involves smallholder farmers in developing countries. While previous studies have looked at economic impacts of contract schemes on smallholder farmers, little is known about farmers' preferences for contracting in general, and for specific contract design attributes in particular. Better understanding farmers' preferences and constraints is important to make smallholder contract schemes more viable and beneficial. This article builds on a choice experiment to analyze farmers' preferences and preference heterogeneity for contracts in Kenya. In the study region, supermarkets use contracts to source fresh vegetables directly from preferred suppliers. However, farmer dropout rates are high. Mixed logit models are estimated to examine farmers' attitudes towards critical contract design attributes. Having to deliver their harvest to urban supermarkets is costly; hence farmers require a significant output price premium. Farmers also dislike delayed payments that are commonplace in contract schemes. The most problematic contract attribute is related to unpredictable product rejection rates, substantially adding to farmers' risk. Designing contracts with lower transaction costs, more transparent quality grading, and fairer risk-sharing arrangements could enhance smallholder participation in supermarket procurement channels.

N2  - On formal credit markets, access to formal credit and reasonable credit terms of smallholder farmers in rural sub-Saharan Africa is limited due to adverse selection. Financial institutions operating in rural areas often cannot distinguish between borrowers (farmers) that are creditworthy and those that are not, thus, allocate limited resource to agriculture to reduce credit risk. In the presence of limited business quality signaling by smallholder farmers, financial institutions shall demand for collateral and/or offer unfavorable contract terms. Moreover, agricultural productivity of rural sub-Saharan Africa, dominated by subsistence or small-scale farmers, is also negatively impacted by the adverse effect of climate change. A strategy that may make the farming practices of smallholder farmer's climate resilient and profitable may also improve smallholder farmer's access to formal credit. This study investigates to what extent participating in ecosystem and extension services (EES) programs signals business quality of smallholders, thus granting them credit accessibility. We collected data on 210 smallholder farmers in 2013, comprising farmers that receive payments for ecosystem services (PES) and farm management training from the International Small Group Tree Planting Program (TIST) Kenya to test the aforementioned theory empirically. We use game theory, particularly a screening and sorting model, to illustrate the prospects for farmers with EES to access formal credit and to improve their credit terms given that they receive PES and banking services training. Furthermore, the PES' long term duration (10-30 years) generates stable cash-flow which may be perceived as collateral substitute. Results suggest that smallholder farmers in the TIST program were less likely to be credit constraint compared to non-TIST farmers. Distance to market, education, livestock and farm income are factors that determine access to credit from microfinance institutions in rural Kenya. Amongst farmers that have obtained loans, those keeping business records enjoy more favorable formal credit conditions. These farmers were observed to pay ca. 5 percent less interest rate in microfinance charges. For TIST farmers, this type of farm management practices may be attributed to the banking services and other training they receive within the program. While the availability of classical collateral (farmlands) and PES may reduce interest rate, the latter was found to be statistically insignificant. This research underlines the importance of an effective extension services in rural areas of developing countries and the need to improve gains from conservation agriculture and ensuing PES. The benefits associated with EES and PES may encompass agricultural financing.

N2  - Many tropical regions are experiencing a rapid growth of oil palm cultivation. In Indonesia, the world's leading palm oil producer, in addition to large companies, smallholder farmers are increasingly engaged in the oil palm sector. Smallholder oil palm cultivation may contribute to income gains and socio-economic development. However, land-use decisions by smallholders are not well understood. Without appropriate policies, negative social and environmental consequences can also occur. To improve the knowledge base, we use data about present and past land-use decisions from a survey of farm households in Sumatra. Employing duration models, we analyse the determinants and dynamics of oil palm adoption among smallholders. We find that independently operating farmers are currently driving growth rates in the oil palm sector. Smallholder adoption decisions are mainly attributable to regional and village level factors. While the current adoption primarily occurs outside of contracts, previous contractual ties between companies and other farmers in the same village play an important role for individual decisions. Beyond initial adoption, we also analyse later expansion decisions. While expanding the oil palm area subsequent to initial adoption is common among all types of adopters, those without previous contracts are found to expand significantly faster. We conclude that the concessions the government has allocated to palm oil companies in the past have initiated oil palm adoption in the small farm sector, but that the ensuing land-use dynamics are mostly beyond government control. Some wider implications are discussed.

N2  - This keynote paper analyses the changes and increasing interactions in all nodes of value chains that include upstream (farmer-producers), midstream (processors, wholesalers and other logistics) and downstream (retailers) from a value chain perspective as well as with those of the sectoral innovation system. This paper focuses on domestic value chains and disruptive innovations at different nodes in value chain framework in its interaction with innovation systems. Also, it presents endogeneity corrected evidence on the impacts of supermarket procurement in a semi-arid region of the country. This paper presented evidence on impacts of supermarket procurement in a semi-arid region from a study of 254 vegetable growers that sell to both supermarkets and traditional markets. Analysing the data using different methods to control selection bias showed that there has been a significant and positive impact of participating in supermarket procurement on net income. Further, the entry into these new markets is not conditioned by land ownership, but rather by possession of irrigation. Forces of globalisation, changing demand pattern with rising incomes and urbanisation, rapid strides in information and communication technologies, and transformative roles for institutional actors in state, private sector and civil society have been altering the landscape of agricultural production and marketing in the last few years. Also, there are now increased interactions between retailers, wholesalers, processors, logistics, cold storages, farmers and consumers. Further, the entry into these new markets is not conditioned by land ownership, but rather by possession of irrigation. Therefore, policy makers may consider improving conditions for entry of resource poor farmers into these modern markets, which might become much more dominant in the years to come as happened elsewhere in other developing countries.

N2  - Our research examines the benefits and drawbacks for cooperatives who participate in voluntary coffee certifications. We interviewed administrators at twenty Costa Rican coffee cooperatives about management practices related to voluntary certification. Voluntary certifications are popular among coffee cooperatives. Access to certified markets is facilitated by state support of the cooperative sector, regulation of the coffee sector and well-enforced environmental and social laws. However, there are no significant or consistent financial incentives for farmers to pursue certification. Multiple certifications may lower auditing and implementation costs, but cooperatives rarely receive the full premium for multiply-certified coffee. Low market demand for certified coffee, weak price incentives and high auditing and management costs encourage cooperatives to certify only a portion of their members. This strategy rewards compliant farmers rather than inducing widespread change to farming practices among the entire membership. Though financial incentives are weak, certifications offer non-financial benefits to both farmers and cooperatives, including better management and more resilient cooperatives.

N2  - Self-efficacy is the belief of an individual to have the ability to be successful in a given domain. Social capital is the economic value of a person's relationships. In the context of this study, self-efficacy is the belief of a farmer to be able to improve her income with contract farming, which increases her actual ability. Social capital increases the ability of the farmers through social support. We surveyed 400 smallholder pineapple farmers and find that both self-efficacy and social capital are decisive for their successful integration into contract farming. To identify causal effects, we use two instruments, which are also of interest on their own: the historical presence of (1) cocoa cooperatives and (2) Christian missionary schools. During Ghana's colonial period, the British established cocoa cooperatives, which differed in their performance as a function of biogeographic factors and thus persistently shaped the self-efficacy of the farmers. Roughly at the same time, Christian missionaries established missionary schools, which impacted the traditional societies so that social capital decreased. The finding that self-efficacy and social capital are still shaped by historic variables could indicate that these variables are only slowly changing, or that they only do so in the absence of policy intervention. The latter raises the possibility that effective policies could benefit from strong reinforcing feedbacks once self-efficacy and social capital improve.

N2  - With the rapid growth of horticultural value chains, the use of contractual farming arrangements, strategies of quality control (farm audits/crop rejections), pricing incentives, and distribution efficiencies (crop collection arrangements) are increasingly breaking market barriers, for example, private standards, certification, traceability, and supply reliability in developing countries. Cognizant of market access, farm produce value, sustainable production, and reduction of postharvest losses, this paper investigated whether farm size, schooling, producer price, farm visits, and social capital networks condition these strategies. The results show that use of written contracts is conditioned by farm sizes, more extension, and number of producer groups (PGs) while farm certification is positively predicted by farm sizes, more extension, number of sellers in the village and seasons with the same buyer. However, certification is less responsive to producer prices. Crop rejections are predicted to be less depending on a farmer's education, number of PGs, and the producer price but are more likely to increase the more the number of sellers. Further, the results show that a forward pricing incentive is highly correlated with higher producer prices, more extension, and number of seasons with the same buyer. Finally, uncollected produce at harvest is likely to decrease with farm sizes, more education and extension, higher producer price, number of PGs, and seasons with the same buyer but is more likely to increase the higher the number of sellers. Implications are made.

N2  - It has now become almost a stylized fact that sustained agricultural growth is central to rapid poverty reduction and economic development. Yet, world poverty is largely concentrated in the agrarian societies, which have the potential for agricultural productivity growth. This is particularly true for Sub-Saharan African countries, where the gaps between potential and actual yields remain high. Minimizing this gap through the promotion of modern inputs--such as fertilizer and modern seeds--has been at the core of almost all development strategies in Ethiopia. Among other initiatives, the country has promoted microfinance institutions and member-owned financial cooperatives to alleviate credit constraints of the smallholder farmers. This paper analyzes the impacts of these institutions. Using household survey data and a propensity-score-matching technique, we examine the effects that institutional financial services have on farmers' adoption of agricultural technology in Ethiopia. The results suggest that access to institutional finance has a significant positive impact on both the adoption and extent of technology use. However, when impacts are disaggregated by type of financial institution and farm size, heterogeneities are observed. In particular, financial cooperatives have a greater impact on technology adoption than microfinance institutions, and the results appear to vary depending on farm size and types of inputs. The paper concludes with implications for policies to promote adoption of modern agricultural inputs.

N2  - Warehouse receipt systems (WRS) allow farmers and traders to access markets and financial systems. While this system is not new in Uganda, as seen by both public and private effort since 2004 during its pilot, very little is known about why it failed to ensure market access and credit. With the Uganda Warehouse Receipt System Authority in place, the government of Uganda seeks to reinstate the public warehouse receipt system with a focus on the electronic WRS (E-WRS). This study therefore seeks to document perceived benefits and challenges of private sector stakeholders of the WRS in Uganda. This paper relies on qualitative data and follows the Structure-Conduct-Performance framework used to analyse agricultural commodity markets. The results reveal that while the market structure and conduct of the pilot WRS was implemented as theorized, it faced various barriers that led to poor market performance. Despite the challenges, actors are optimistic that reinstating the WRS will lead to better access to markets and credit. The paper draws important policy implications for the implementation of the WRS, including the need for government to spearhead promotion of standards, improvements in smallholder productivity, capacity strengthening of collective action, and the importance of increased sensitization on all aspects of the WRS.

N2  - Using an original dataset from the Vietnamese catfish sector, I analyze the impact of vertical coordination options, namely, contract farming and vertical integration, on farm performance, which is measured in terms of yields and revenue per hectare. The effects of vertical coordination are estimated using a maximum simulated likelihood estimator and a two-stage least square regression with instrumental variables to account for endogenous farm and household characteristics and selection on unobservable characteristics. The results show that vertically integrated farms have substantially higher yields and revenue per hectare than nonintegrated farms. The levels of gains that can be attributed to integration are large and consistent under different estimation procedures, and there is no difference between nonintegrated and contract farms in terms of farm performance.

N2  - This article examines how Payments for Environmental Services (PES) influence household land-use behavior in the context of common-property lands. PES programs have been increasingly applied to communities who collectively manage their lands. While a number of authors have expressed concerns about the ability of said programs to generate additional environmental benefits and the potential for PES to counter community resource management arrangements, few empirical studies have explicitly examined PES in the context of communal resource management. Here, we take advantage of the gradual rollout of an Ecuadorian PES program to compare land-use behavior on collective lands in participant communities to households in communities that are waiting to participate. The goals of the analysis are to (a) identify if the PES program has produced changes in land-use, (b) assess the degree to which household characteristics and communal governance conditions drive land-use behavior, and (c) explore the interplay between PES and communal resource management institutions. Data were gathered from a cross-sectional survey of 399 households located in 11 communities. We use difference-in-differences to estimate the average effect of PES program participation on household behavior. Logit models, coupled with qualitative analysis, unpack how communal governance characteristics influence land-use behavior and the interplay between communal governance conditions and PES. We find that PES reduced the number of households grazing livestock on collective lands by 12%, however, household and communal governance factors are also instrumental in determining land-use decisions. Our results provide empirical insights into the debate over PES in collective resource management and illustrate how PES and communal resource management institutions can build upon each other to attain desired household conservation behavior.

N2  - Empirical evidence on the role of cattle sharing and rental contracts in agrarian economies is limited. This article is an investigation of different types of cattle sharing and rental contracts producers in rural Ethiopia adopt. It also investigates why households in rural Ethiopia rely on these contracts that are vulnerable and therefore subject to potential moral hazard problems described in earlier literature. We apply random effect probit and control function econometric methods to household panel data collected in 2005 and 2007 from two agro-ecological zones in Ethiopia. Controlling for the endogeneity of access to livestock credit, we find that contracts are spatially fragmented and better developed where population density is high and credit and insurance markets are poorly developed. We also find that contracts help cash poor and credit constrained households to improve their herd dynamics, to get access to nonlivestock resources (land, labor and cash) and share risks that could have been difficult without the contract. We show that contracts are rational responses of residents in rural communities characterized by imperfect credit and insurance services, since households with better access to credit are less likely to rely on contracts.

N2  - While linking the smallholder farmer to the dairy value chain industry has identified a potential pathway to get out of poverty trap by raising incomes and by increasing the availability of nutrient-dense foods in Ethiopia, much less is known about the poverty implication of smallholder participation in dairy value chain. We assess nutrition impacts of smallholder farmers' participation in the formal milk value chain with cross sectional survey data from Ethiopia. To assess smallholder farmer households' food and nutrition security outcomes, we employed multiple food access measurements such as per capita dietary energy intake, food consumption score, and household income. We use propensity score matching model to analyze impact pathways. The results show that as compared to households without participation, households with participation have higher dietary energy intake, dietary diversity, and household income. However, there is a negative association between participation in the milk value chain and level of milk consumption. We find that smallholder farmer participation in milk value chain has a positive significant effect on food sufficiency, dietary diversity and income. This study, therefore, confirms the potential role of smallholder farmers' participation in agri-food value chain to get out of poverty trap through improving rural household income, food security and nutrition.

N2  - The recent Collective Forest Tenure Reform in China has started the process of devolving forest management rights from village collectives to households since 2003. In this paper, we study the impact of the reform on rural energy consumption. Devolving forest tenure improves farmers' access to forest products on their newly acquired forestland, and is therefore expected to increase farmers' fuelwood consumption. The reform also allows farmers to adopt some revenue-enhancing forest technologies which may lead to energy switching in farmer households. Our empirical study finds that the devolution significantly increases household fuelwood consumption for both lower and higher income households; the lower income households benefit more. This is welfare-improving in places where alternative fuels are still too costly. We find limited evidence that higher income households in Yunnan begin to substitute alternative commercial fuels for fuelwood when those are available. Our findings suggest further devolution of forest rights, especially in the poor, forest-rich regions.

N2  - Recurrent food insecurity in the highlands of Central America has been exacerbated by the recent convergence of a coffee leaf rust outbreak that began defoliating crops in 2011 and a drought that started in 2014. In the context of these multiple challenges, this paper explores how seasonal hunger is related to smallholder organizational affiliation, farm and farmer characteristics, and post-hazard household-level coping strategies. The study integrates qualitative research, hydro-climatic data analysis, and a survey of 368 households completed in 2014. A number of household capacities correlate significantly with shorter periods of seasonal hunger: households with larger farms, with off-farm employment, and that produce more than half of their food, maintain more fruit trees, and harvest more coffee reported fewer lean months. We find evidence consistent with path dependence in how households cope with a sequence of environmental hazards, as the reported use of less preferred coping responses to past events (e.g., Hurricane Mitch and the 2009 drought) tended to correlate with their continued use after subsequent hazards. A comparison of coping responses of households affiliated with a farmer-to-farmer institution promoting subsistence-oriented production with those affiliated with cooperatives prioritizing sustainable coffee exports shows that farmer institutions were not strongly correlated with the number of lean months or coping mechanisms.

N2  - The low crop yields, increasing costs of cultivation, and the low price realisation have been important concerns in smallholder agriculture like that of India. Institutional innovations are important for inclusive agricultural development in India as they go beyond products and technology and are about ways of doing things. Contract farming has been studied as an institutional innovation in agribusiness but not agri-franchising though it is also an innovation in the field of agribusiness as it is about reaching farmers differently. This paper examines the effectiveness and inclusiveness of agri-franchising with the help of a case study from Bihar which is based on interviews with the franchisor (GAPL), its franchisees and a primary survey of its buying farmers and non-buying farmers in Bihar's two districts--Vaishali and Muzaffarpur--where it has substantial presence. It is found that the Dehaat (franchised outlet) farmers in general were larger than their non-Dehaat counterparts both in owned and operated land holdings. Very few farmers (9 per cent) reported that they could cut down the cost of cultivation due to the Dehaat based extension. But, more than 92 per cent of farmers reported an increase in yields. The extension contribution of Dehaat is noteworthy as is its role in smallholder market linkage for output in the context of abolition of APMC Act in the state. The functioning of the Dehaat centres and the farmers uptake of it shows that the new channels can lead to more informed farmer level input use and realisation of higher prices in the smallholder context.

N2  - This article analyzes households' choice on tea varieties in Vietnam by using a multinomial logit model. The modeling takes into account the issue of unobserved individual heterogeneity and the endogeneity of some explanatory variables (use of chemical and organic fertilizers). The results show that important factors influencing the decision to adopt one type of tea varieties include income, age, household size, farming contract, and use of organic fertilizers, but also membership of professional associations such as the Tea Association and the Farmers Union.

N2  - Repeated droughts in agriculture have promoted intensive reliance upon groundwater resources, thereby exacerbating the already stressed groundwater reservoir situations all across the globe. This has also resulted in increased inequality among farmers by allowing those with better physical assets, such as borewells, to extract water at the cost of less affluent farmers. As a response, bore pool sharing collective arrangements were introduced in some parts of India, with the intention of slowing down the rate of groundwater depletion and helping improve the livelihoods of the worst affected farmers. Such arrangements work through promoting collective management of groundwater resources by providing critical and timely irrigation to rain-fed crops and through dis-incentivizing the cultivation of high water consuming crops. We investigate the impact of bore pool sharing programs on crop incomes and cropping patterns of the participating households in South India. A Probit-2SLS model and Propensity score matching method are used to evaluate the impact of such programs while controlling for self-selection biases. Results indicate that farmers' participation in bore pool sharing collectives is positively associated with their crop incomes. However, contrary to expectation, the share of high water-intensive crops also increases with participation. In addition, share of water-intensive crops is higher for a collective group with a higher ratio of bore wells to number of participating households. Finally, farmers within the pool with multiple past failed bore well sinking attempts tend to extract more water, thereby threatening the sustainability of the groundwater as well as the livelihoods of the farming community.

N2  - Under the Group-scheme operated by the Small Farmers Development Programme (SFDP) in Nepal, the circumstances in which the Group Organizer (GO) is expected to carry out the 'pre-investment survey' preclude him from obtaining any meaningful data on farmers incomes. The country's (Sri Lanka) financial system is fuelled on two types of funds: "hot" and "cold" money. 'Cold' money is that which comes from the State, and is often thought of as a real or potential subsidy. Loans from 'hot' money are derived from cooperative members, savings and must, therefore, be handled carefully. Though it is an established fact that agricultural producers and cooperative members are eligible to have access to two capital markets--institutional (through banking channels on conventional terms based on commercial considerations) and informal (through Isusu Trust Societies, etc., on non-conventional terms based on welfare motive)--in reality, developing countries plagued with many economic difficulties and resultant financial problems find it very difficult to have access to institutional (conventional) financing ('cold' money) facilities and are forced by circumstances to resort to informal financing institutions for easy 'hot' money flow. The author after detailed a research study that has proposed a financial management model to handle the issue of informal financing ('hot' money flow) through the proposed Isusu and Trust Society for executives in Nigeria.

N2  - This article presents estimates of AH1N1's effects on the consumption of pork through an Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) for meat consumption in Mexico. Additionally, indirect effects through the Mexican economy are estimated using a general equilibrium model that captures the effects of intersectoral relationships and the induced effects by the circular flow of income. It is concluded that the presumed risk of contracting AH1N1 via pork consumption provoked total economic losses of $94 million. The rumor affected the pork sector, the grains sector and the manufacturing sector of food, beverages and tobacco. The poor rural households were the most affected.

N2  - This paper studies nonmarket institutions that facilitate exports. In Malawi, as in many other developing countries, farmers face numerous constraints that disconnect them from export markets. We explore the role of a local institution, the burley tobacco clubs, in bridging smallholders to exports. Burley clubs potentially enable farmers to increase their tobacco farming productivity by providing services related to institutional access, collective action, economies of scale, and supporting network. Using matching methods and instrumental variable techniques, we find that tobacco club membership causes an increase in output per acre between 40 and 74 percent and an increase in tobacco sales per acre between 45 and 89 percent. Instead, neither the land share allocated to tobacco nor the unit value obtained by the producers is affected by club membership.

N2  - The role of agriculture in economic development and the development politics of promoting smallholder versus large-scale agriculture have both been at the center of a long-lasting and controversial debate. Using an innovative methodology which combines a value chain approach with input-output-analysis, the growth multipliers and productivity of both farm types in Guatemala are analyzed. Results show that smallholder agriculture has the same potential to stimulate output growth as large-scale agriculture. Smallholder value chains include mainly informal sectors and create more jobs than commercial agriculture. Therefore, a reorientation of agricultural and land policies toward small-scale food producers and within a comprehensive policy of integrated rural development is not only necessary in terms of social equity but also for boosting economic development.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze determinants of farmers' participation and credit rationing in microcredit programs using survey data from Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the Garrett Ranking Technique to analyze farmers' reasons for participation or non-participation in credit programs, a probit regression model to estimate factors influencing farm households' participation, and the Heckman's sample selection model to identify factors influencing farm households' probability of being credit rationed by microcredit programs. Findings: The results reveal that farm households participate in credit programs because of improved access to savings services and agricultural loans. Fear of loan default and lack of savings are reasons for non-participation in credit programs. Furthermore, membership in farmer-based organizations (FBOs) and the household head's formal education are positively associated with farmers' participation in credit programs. The likelihood of farmers being credit rationed (i.e. their loan applications were either rejected or the amount of credit they applied for was reduced) is less likely among higher income farmers and members of FBOs such as farmer cooperatives and savings clubs.

N2  - This paper reports results of a quasi-experimental study designed to assess the impact of an information and communication technology (ICT)-enabled ecosystem, led by the social enterprise eKutir, on household fruit and vegetable consumption in Odisha, India. eKutir aims at providing self-sustaining solutions to poverty and undernutrition in developing countries by leveraging ICTs through ecosystem development anchored into a distributed micro-entrepreneurial strategy. eKutir's farming micro-entrepreneurs (FME) provide agricultural knowledge, inputs, and market linkages at household and community level, followed by progressive integration of other micro-entrepreneurs at different points along the value chain on both supply and demand sides. The present case examined core FMEs along with retail micro-entrepreneurs (RMEs) deployed in low-resource rural and urban communities. Structural equation modeling was used to compare rural outcomes and the role of homegrown consumption as a mediator. Multivariable linear regression and ANOVA were used to test group differences in the urban sample. Positive beta coefficients represent an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption in communities exposed to the eKutir ecosystem in contrast to the comparison group. Farmers in rural communities exposed to the eKutir ecosystem consumed more overall fruit and vegetables (beta = 0.30, p < 0.001) and fruits alone (beta = 0.53, p < 0.05) than those farmers in comparison villages unexposed to the eKutir ecosystem. This effect was concentrated in households exposed to both FMEs + RMEs (beta = 0.60, p < 0.0001) and was mediated by homegrown consumption. A non-significant directional effect was observed in comparing fruit and vegetable consumption in rural households exposed to RMEs only over comparison communities. Urban consumers, exposed to the eKutir ecosystem through access to RMEs operating in their neighborhood community, did not increase their fruit or vegetable consumption compared to non-intervention communities. The results reveal the potential of reaching nutritional impacts through homegrown consumption and with farm-level support outside of governmental/philanthropic interventions through an ICT-enabled social enterprise. They also underscore, however, the challenges of both changing eating behaviour and intervening along the agri-food value chain. Implication for more effective digital ecosystem design and intersectoral policies are discussed.

N2  - This article addresses smallholder oil palm farming in Indonesia and the risk of falling into poverty by comparing contract and non-contract smallholders. We use an asset-based approach to define vulnerability and apply propensity score matching analysis to assess the impact of contract farming. Data were collected from a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2010 of 245 oil palm smallholder households, 126 of which were contract smallholders. The study finds that approximately 40 per cent of oil palm smallholders can be classified as stochastic-transient poor. We also show that while contract participation reduces the negative impact of oil palm price shocks, this is not the case for production shocks. The study concludes that despite positive income effects, contract smallholders also remain vulnerable to poverty.

N2  - Purpose: Contract farming (CF) is seen as a tool for creating new market opportunities hence increasing incomes for smallholder farmers. Critics, however, argue that CF is likely to pass risks to small scale farmers, thus favouring large scale farmers at the expense of smallholder farmers. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of CF on smallholder farmers' income using a case study of avocado farmers in Kandara district in Kenya. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses data collected from 100 smallholder avocado farmers in Kandara district in Kenya and employs an instrumental variable model (Probit-2SLS) to control for endogeneity in participation in the contract and examine the effect of CF on household, farm and avocado income. Findings: The results indicate that participation in CF is not sufficient to improve household, farm and avocado income. Question remains regarding efficient implementation of CF arrangements to promote spill over effects on other household enterprises.

N2  - Value-chain collaboration (VCC) aims to increase smallholder productivity and market integration. Higher productivity, better incomes and innovations have been documented, but also exclusionary trends and loss of biological and dietary diversity. New forms of VCC 'beyond the chain' hope to tackle this through collaboration with non-chain actors. Drawing on territorially embedded VCC, food sovereignty and landscape governance theories, this article presents a conceptual framework to analyse whether and how inclusive VCC, greater farmer autonomy and sustainable landscapes can be achieved. Key elements of our approach are knowledge of smallholders' various livelihood trajectories and selective value-chain engagement; multi-stakeholder definition of the sustainability choice space; and smallholder inclusion in adaptive learning and empowerment processes that bring together and integrate different and oft-competing knowledge systems and governance levels. This approach will support further action research in learning platforms in Ghana and South Africa. The article discusses the link with the broader inclusive development debate.

N2  - This study assesses the impact of cooperative membership among dairy producers in Selale, Ethiopia. We selected ten impact indicators: proportion of dairy income to total household income, total dairy income, proportion of crossbreed cows to the total number of cows in the herd (indicator of technological innovation), amount of feed bought (another indicator of technological innovation), milk production, milk productivity, commercialization, price per liter of milk, price per kg of butter and the share of milk production that is processed at the household level. In order to minimize the biases that may arise by simply comparing members and non-members, we employed a propensity score matching technique. The empirical analysis shows that cooperatives are strong in facilitating technological transformations and commercialization but weak in offering better prices. These findings suggest structural trade-offs between different domains of cooperatives' action. Overall, our study concludes that cooperatives can be efficient business institutions to foster rural development and food security.

N2  - Several studies have suggested that socio-economic factors and production site characteristics are primary determinants of farmers' participation in 'low-carbon', agro-industrial (biofuels and oil palm) production contracts. In the Philippines, many smallholder farmers have expressed their intent to participate in intensive production of biofuel crops and oil palm with state and private organizations; others have resisted or remained indifferent. This study looks into smallholders' social construction of the environment and how this may influence their decisions to participate in such production contracts. The study is based on a survey of 462 respondents in eight communities in the province of Palawan. Using regression analysis, it illustrates how smallholders' sense of place and environmental worldviews, together with demographic and socio-economic variables, play significant roles in their decisions to enter into new biofuels (jatropha) and oil palm production contracts. Environmental worldviews are significant when there are strong negative perceptions attached to a particular crop production contract, as in the case of oil palm.

N2  - Certification is promoted to improve rural welfare through better market access and improved agricultural practices. We compare net effects of Fairtrade- and Utz-Certified coffee production in Central Kenya, using a matched panel from 218 farm-households that belong to three cooperatives and were visited twice in 2009 and 2013. We distinguish between effects at field, farm, household, cooperative, community, and market levels. Both certification regimes improved coffee returns, but Fairtrade was more effective in coffee processing, whereas Utz contributed to productivity. Under stagnating coffee prices, Fairtrade farmers increased their coffee specialization, while Utz farmers reduced coffee areas but increased yield.

N2  - Access to markets is one important strategy which can assist smallholder farmers to move out of poverty. Collective action through farmers' groups has been identified as a strategy to improve the participation of farmers in markets. This study analyzes the determinants of participation and intensity of participation of collective action in production and marketing of avocado in Kenya. Group participation and the intensity were modelled as a binary choice decision and analyzed using logit models. Interviews were conducted with 301 farmers in avocado production zones in Kenya. The result showed that age, education, gender and perceptions on knowledge and improved technology influence farmers' decision to participate in group activities. Occupation, area of residence and farmers' perception on knowledge and improved technology use, and economic benefits had a significant influence on the intensity of participation. We conclude that it is crucial to educate farmers through trainings, workshops and seminars before group formation in order to ensure that they understand the importance and impact of collective action. Finally, development practitioners and government organizations which intend to intervene through farmers' groups should understand farmers' perceptions and hence expectations from the groups.

N2  - Smallholder farmers' participation in agricultural cooperatives is often promoted as a promising strategy for overcoming market imperfections and to increase farmers' productivity and income. In recognition of this potential, in recent years, Ethiopia has shown renewed interest in promoting cooperatives. However, there is lack of empirical evidence of the impact that cooperatives have on farmers' performance in Ethiopia. Using a matching technique, we evaluate the impact of coffee cooperatives on the performance of their member households in terms of income and coffee production. We use data from coffee farmers in south-west Ethiopia. The overall results suggest that members of cooperatives are not faring much better than non-members. The treatment effects we measured were not statistically significant from zero. Yet, the aggregate figures mask differences between cooperatives and amongst individual cooperative members. Average treatment effects on members differ between cooperatives, in general older members, those who have benefitted from more education and those with larger coffee plantations seem to benefit more from membership. Our analysis sheds light on the heterogeneity in the impact that membership of a cooperative can have: this differs by cooperative and by members within cooperatives, a finding that has important policy implications.

N2  - Considerable empirical work relates participation in contract farming with farm profitability. However causation is far from settled as few studies control for endogeneity of participation. Moreover the link between contract farming and equity is ambiguous as the association between contract farming and farmer endowments is mixed. This case study of smallholders in the tobacco industry addresses these issues, and seems to be the first such econometric application in the Philippines. Based on a treatment effects regression, contract farming increases profitability, with participation biased toward smaller farm sizes, supporting the positive role of contract farming toward inclusive growth in rural areas.

N2  - Agricultural cooperatives in China, known as Farmers' Professional Cooperatives (FPCs), are becoming popular and have been intensely promoted by the Chinese government to facilitate agro-industrialization of small farmers. This paper investigates the impacts of the participation in FPCs on farm income by dividing rural households into two village groups (whether villages were designated as "agricultural model villages") as well as controlling endogenous bias of participation. Estimated results show that the economic impacts of the participation in agricultural model villages are much larger than those in other villages, since agricultural related services offered by FPCs in appear to be more standardized in agricultural model villages.

N2  - The objective of this study is to identify the key risks facing each of the stakeholders in the export-focused paprika value chain in Zambia. Although a deterministic cost-benefit analysis indicated that this outgrower scheme would have a very satisfactory net present value (NPV), a Monte Carlo analysis using an integrated financial-economic-stakeholder model identifies a number of risk variables that could make this system unsustainable. The major risks include the variability of the real exchange rate in Zambia; the international price of paprika; and the farm yield rates. This analysis points out that irrigation systems are very important for both stabilising and increasing yields. The analysis also shows the limitations of loan financing for such outgrower arrangements when at the sector level it is difficult or even impossible to mitigate the risks from real exchange rate movements and changes in international commodity prices. This micro-level analysis shows how critical real exchange rate management policies are in achieving sustainability of such export-oriented value chains.

N2  - Smallholder farmers in South Africa find it challenging to participate in the modern economy. Most of these farmers have limited access to credit and insurance, and to markets in which to sell their produce. This paper reviews ethnographic research data and argues that smallholder farmers struggle to take part in modern agricultural value chains in South Africa. System dynamics modelling is used to understand the dynamics relating to agricultural value-chain participants, and to determine whether the ethnographic research data is sufficient to answer the question as to which value-chain participants potentially have the largest impact on smallholder farmers. The modelling results show that banks may have the potential to trigger an impact on smallholder farmers' productivity that could then attract other value-chain industries to take part in efforts to support these farmers. Smallholder farmers could become a long-term viable and sustainable option for increasing food security in South Africa. However, this study has its limitations. The data used from existing ethnographic research, conducted by way of semi-structured interviews with value-chain participants, is limited and is not able to answer questions such as: (i) how much each industry is prepared to engage with smallholder farmers in the event of other industries being prepared to do the same; and (ii) how long it will take each industry to react to a willingness to engage. Ongoing research is required to extend the interviewee base and data in order to answer these questions and for the model to be completed and used for policy guidance.

N2  - The indirect effects of biofuels are mostly considered negative. In this paper, we argue that there may be a positive indirect effect of biofuels on food security and poverty. Using micro-level evidence and a matched plot pair design through which we control for plot and farmer characteristics, we show that the introduction of castor production for biofuel in a poor country as Ethiopia can significantly improve food productivity of rural households who produce raw material for biofuel production. This spillover seems particularly linked to enhanced access to inputs and technical assistance which were provided as part of biofuel feedstock production contracts. Our results thus document another mechanism through which biofuels may influence smallholders' food security, a mechanism that did not receive attention so far.

N2  - Smallholder dairy farming is a key economic activity for improving rural livelihoods. This paper reports a study on six smallholder dairy groups that evaluated the importance of gender-concerns in the dairy value-chain towards improved livelihoods. Longitudinal study design was applied for two years from April 2012. Purposive and multistage sampling techniques were used. Data collection was through focus group discussions and evaluations. Data analyses encompassed descriptive statistics, value-scale ranking and gender-analyses. Men dominated decision-making and resource-control, indicating gender-inequality. Women performed all the nine activities in the three counties, over 70% while men and youths shared about 30%. Percentage change in milk handled and incomes generated ranged from 15.3 to 100 and 13.3 to 102 respectively after intervention (especially training on gender issues) within the groups. Hence, gender-concerns indeed mattered.

N2  - This article investigates the potential household welfare implications of large-scale agro-industry investments in Sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, it compares the income and poverty of households integrated into a Malawian sugar investment with those households not integrated. Two different supply-chain set-ups are studied: smallholder outgrower and vertically integrated estate-production systems. Potential selection bias is addressed using propensity score matching and a number of robustness checks. We find significant positive income differences between participants in either supply-chain set-up and the respective counterfactual. Overall, income poverty is significantly lower among outgrowers relative to the counterfactual, whereas in the case of estate workers these differences are only significant for the extreme poverty line. Qualitative interviews confirm these results, but they also allude to risks for the rural poor associated with social conflicts in the expansion of new outgrower schemes as well as a lack of transparency in the operation of existing schemes, which are likely to undermine the poverty-reducing potentials of such investments.

N2  - This paper explores the ecological economics of small-scale cooperative banking (SSCB) through reference to the empirical case of a rice-farming village in Kampot, Cambodia. It combines Georgescu-Roegen's discussion of an economy's capacity to produce economic processes with Ostrom's concept of institutional performance, in order to address the implications and functioning of SSCB within a small-farmer economy. The local collective action situation of maintaining and making use of a SSCB system--a specific finance model--provides the studied community with access to a pooled capital fund that may play an important role in ensuring its capacity to produce and reproduce economic processes, according to its own specifications. The coordinated action among the villagers, which matches up well with Ostrom's criteria for effective institutional performance of common pool resource use governance, is found to include social and environmental dimensions, which we understand to be necessary for achieving transformations toward more sustainable economic activity. While we do not wish to suggest that the adoption of SSCB guarantees either improved ecological or social impacts, our results suggest that this finance model could play a supporting role in enhancing the potential of small-farming communities to improve both, should they wish to do so.

N2  - This study examines the impacts of participation in off-farm work and land tenancy contracts on the intensity of investment in soil-improving measures and farm productivity. A multivariate Tobit model that accounts for potential endogeneity between the intensity of investment and the off-farm work and tenancy contract variables is estimated for 341 rural households in Punjab province of Pakistan. An instrumental variable approach is also used to analyse the impact of tenancy contract and off-farm work on farm productivity. The empirical results show that participation in off-farm work and tenure security tends to increase the intensity of investment in long-term soil-improving measures. We also find that increases in off-farm work and tenure security exert significant and positive effects on farm productivity.

N2  - The multidimensional approach in poverty research is dominating over the monetary based poverty approaches worldwide. The failure in millennium development goal in terms of reducing absolute poverty by its half lead United Nation Development Program to adopt Sustainable Development Goal. Social business is a new form of business concept put into practice firstly in Bangladesh to trigger poverty in such a multidimensional approach. Similarly, Sustainable livelihood, is a popular model of intervening poverty to the development agencies due to its design of participating people in the project policies, supports the multidimensionality too. The purpose of this study is to discuss about the conceptual explanation of social business and sustainable livelihood. Besides, this paper also portrays the conceptual linkages of social business with the sustainable livelihood framework. The present study is of qualitative in nature where extensive literature review has been conducted adopting an intensive desk research method using secondary data sources like published articles, working papers, brochures and companies official websites via internet. The study found that social business, in general, possess the feature of reducing vulnerability of people directly providing with an array of products and indirectly, with its innovative policy of making involve deprived people in the entire value chain as active participants. In addition, its integrative business approach helps in searching people's deficiencies like knowledge, skills, affordability and taking remedial measures in the form of training, financial support, frequent surveillance and accumulation of resources. The study concluded that social business, driven by problems and pro-poor approach, could be a complementary model for superseding poverty via sustainable livelihood approach. As implication of the study, it will help policy makers to adopt or adjust their policy regarding bringing sustainability of people's life with a new tools other than the existing state-run or philanthropy based programs. Besides, it will also broaden the interest of researchers for further empirical tests relevant to this sort of business and effectiveness of it in alleviating poverty and ensuring sustainability.

N2  - Traditional tenancy theory suggests the sharecropping contractual efficiency is less than the fix-rent contract's efficiency without considering the risk factor. When it is transformed into transaction cost and the wage rate reaches certain condition, the conclusion that the sharecropping contract has the same efficiency with the fix-rent contract can be proved. What's more, if the game theory model relaxes the homogeneous factor assumption, then we can get these hypotheses: low quality land and high ability labor are matching with the sharecropping contract; by contrast, high quality land and low ability labor are matching with the fix-rent contract. Basing on it, it proves that the fix-rent contract is the best choice under the symmetry information structure and the sharecropping contract is the best arrangement in the asymmetry information environment. At last, it uses the historical empirical data from Professor Buck's research about 2,866 peasantries in 7 provinces of China in the earlier 20 century to test implication of the theoretic hypothesis.

N2  - Smallholders often have to certify according to international standards and produce under contract for large agro-businesses to access export markets. While mostly positive effects for the farmers have been found for contracts and certifications, often these effects do not persist because contracts fail and certifications are not renewed. We suggest that individual firm behavior is crucial for the long-term success of farmer-agro-business relationships. In this article, we use data of 386 smallholders in the pineapple export sector in Ghana, analyze them quantitatively and enrich it by a detailed case study of a large-scale agro-business in Ghana. The results show that, in an environment with weak contract enforcement, certification is an agent of change in farmer-agro-business relations and that building trust and aligning expectations of farmers and firms largely determine success. We conclude that individual firm behavior matters more than taken into account in previous research. Our case study shows that three 'R'--reliability, reputation and respect--constitute the basis for contract relationships that benefit all.

N2  - Previous studies have demonstrated that there are two important preconditions for encouraging land rental in agriculture: out-migration and the enhancement of security and transferability of land rights. Focusing on the latter, we scrutinize the impacts of institutions aimed at facilitating land use dynamism, particularly the Rural Shareholding Cooperatives (RSCs), which have been established recently at the local level in rural China. In general, we find that RSCs can pave the way for the extension of property rights to farmland and promote more efficient land use patterns. Using survey data collected from 300 village committees in rural Jiangsu province, we estimate the effectiveness of RSCs in encouraging land rental. Our analysis reveals that RSCs can serve as intermediate agents for reducing transaction costs associated with exchange of land use rights and, thereby, not only encourage land rental/consolidation activities but also enable the entry of non-farm household entities into the farm business.

N2  - International trade in medicinal herbal products is growing, while value chains are becoming more complex and governed by a range of public and private standards. There is a debate over the extent to which phytomedicine production can be beneficial for farmers in low- and middle-income countries. More generally, there are varied views about the extent to which small farmers are disadvantaged by stringent public health and private consumer standards in northern markets for agricultural products. This paper proves a comparative analysis of value chains, using case studies of turmeric production in India. It marries a qualitative investigation of turmeric producing sites in India with an investigation into the chemical quality of various turmeric products. The aim of the paper is to understand the way that varied structure and governance of value chains changes the benefits to both producer and consumer. When production is for the organic northern market, we found evidence of a "captive" value chain, where the lead firm requires strict adherence to conditions of production and processing. Prices for farmers were relatively stable, at a reasonably high level. In contrast, where farmers were producing for local markets, including the major auction at Erode, prices were volatile and farmers bore considerable risk. We found that competition and volatility in the market-based chain can lead to turmeric adulteration and contamination, both intentional and unintentional. Our case study suggests that many small turmeric farmers would find it difficult to meet both public and private health standards, in contrast to some academic literature that argues that public health standards do not discriminate against small farmers. More than this, our study adds to the discussion of the impact of standards, suggesting clear consumer benefits in northern markets. However, there are also indications that only larger and more dynamic farmers can participate in the lucrative phytomedicine trade. As such, our study tentatively supports previous literature suggesting that the application of standards in northern markets lead to increasing farmer differentiation.

N2  - In Sub-Saharan African farm households, two types of plot management often coexist: collective fields are farmed jointly by household members under the authority of the head while individual plots are autonomously managed by members. In this paper we explore the productivity differentials between collective and individual plots in the context of extended family farms. We find that land yields are significantly larger on male private plots than on common plots after all appropriate controls have been included. Yet, the disadvantage of common plots exists only for care intensive crops and for cash crops. We provide evidence that the yield differentials stem from labor incentive problems. They may arise from the prevailing reward function and/or from preference heterogeneity over the use of the proceeds from the collective field.

N2  - This article uses household panel data spanning the period 2000-2007 to test hypotheses from the literature that secure land tenure, market access and collective action promote accumulation of private capital assets in rural highland Ethiopia. The three natural capital assets analysed in the article, livestock, eucalyptus trees and non-eucalyptus trees on households' farm plots, make up virtually 100 per cent of privately held disposable assets. Incomes and capital stocks are extremely low and constant and tree assets are at least as important as livestock. We find that collective action and secure land tenure have strong positive effects on accumulation of livestock and other trees, but not eucalyptus. We also find evidence that market access promotes eucalyptus holdings and that other types of wealth tend to be positively associated with private natural capital stocks.

N2  - In 2010, the Iranian Government launched several market-oriented reforms, including the removal of distortions on heavily subsidized food and energy products. We use a microconsistent CGE model with 20 urban and rural households to model the actual characteristics of the food and energy subsidy reforms as implemented by the Iranian Government, calibrated to econometrically estimated income elasticities, and accounting for variations in sources of income and family size across households. Results suggest that food and energy subsidy reforms accompanied by lump-sum payments to households could result in aggregate welfare gains of over 45 per cent, with low income households experiencing welfare gains of well over 100 per cent. Reforms are accompanied by an increase in real government revenue of over 30 per cent. So while the subsidy reform programme is likely responsible for at least some of the inflationary pressures currently being experienced by the Iranian economy, it should not be seen as being responsible for the Iranian government's current fiscal difficulties, nor should it be blamed for the recent contraction of the Iranian economy, both of which are more likely due to the effects of international sanctions and the steep decline in the value of the Iranian Rial.

N2  - Agricultural policies in Rwanda focus on agricultural intensification and increased market orientation of the smallholder farm sector. Cooperatives are seen as key vehicles in this, but little is known about their effectiveness to achieve these goals. In this article, we analyze the impact of cooperative membership on the agricultural performance of rural households in Rwanda. We use cross-sectional survey data, collected in 2012, to analyze the impact of cooperative membership on different agricultural performance indicators, including indicators on agricultural intensification, market orientation, farm revenue, and income. We use several econometric techniques to deal with potential selection bias in estimating the impact of cooperative membership, including a proxy variable method based on a willingness to pay measure and propensity score matching methods. We find that cooperative membership in general has a positive impact on farm performance but these effects are driven by specific types of cooperatives.

N2  - Using household survey data from Ethiopia, this paper evaluates the impact of agricultural cooperatives on smallholders' technical efficiency. We used propensity score matching to compare the average difference in technical efficiency between cooperative member farmers and similar independent farmers. The results show that agricultural cooperatives are effective in providing support services that significantly contribute to members' technical efficiency. These results are found to be insensitive to hidden bias and consistent with the idea that agricultural cooperatives enhance members' efficiency by easing access to productive inputs and facilitating extension linkages. According to the findings, increased participation in agricultural cooperatives should further enhance efficiency gains among smallholder farmers.

N2  - Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to synthesize lessons from the agricultural value chain models and their associated financing mechanisms in China and India as to provide policy recommendations on how best to facilitate development of efficient and inclusive value chains. Design/methodology/approach -- The paper builds on a review of the existing literature on agricultural value chains and their financing mechanisms, and draws lessons from it for strengthening interface between product and financial markets in order to enable smallholders capture benefits of the value addition. Findings -- From the comparative review of value chain financing mechanisms and current policy contexts the authors find dominance of internal financing of value chains (in terms of provision of inputs, technology and services) in both the countries. Value chain finance from commercial banks and other financial institutions is limited and mainly through tripartite agreements among the financing institutions, lead firms and farmers.

N2  - Fair trade and vertical integration represent two popular approaches for enhancing the incomes of organized farmers in a volatile coffee market as compared to the uncertain plight of independent, non-affiliated growers. A mixed method approach, utilizing informal interviews and a household survey in Chiapas, Mexico, analyzed three coffee trading regimes: independent, non-affiliated farmers, and growers in cooperatives pursuing a fair trade or vertical integration strategy. Survey and econometric results indicate that concentration on specialty coffee production with a portfolio of foreign contracts is economically preferable to a vertically integrated cooperative, which in turn produces more favorable coffee prices for smallholders than the non-affiliated conventional, coyote-dominated trading system.

N2  - Smallholder farmers are excluded from efficient and effective participation in high-value agro-food market chains due to major competitiveness constraints and several market failures along these chains. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the competitiveness of smallholder farmers in a more coordinated and sustainable way that promote their effective and efficient participation in high-value agro-food market chains. In particular, the study aims at determining the main role of households' capitals, institutional, and access-related factors in conditioning the decision of smallholder farmers of African indigenous vegetables (AIVs) to access pillars of competitiveness in high-value market chains (HVMCs). For this purpose, a unique household-level data from a total of 1232 rural and peri-urban AIV-producing households were surveyed, and the data obtained were analysed by using a multivariate probit model. The results suggest that about two thirds of smallholder AIV farmers had access to at least one pillar of competitiveness in HVMCs. The model results show the presence of inter-dependency of household level decisions to access multiple pillars of competitiveness in HVMCs. Furthermore, the results also reveal that coping with shocks, coupled with access to information on market prices and warnings of unexpected events, contract farming, certification and modern irrigation technologies are the main conditioning factors to the access of the pillars of competitiveness by smallholder farmers. The promotion and implementation of a well-founded mobile phone-based information access platforms, as well as effective and efficient livelihood strategies that support smallholder farmers to access pillars of competitiveness, is of critical importance towards overcoming the major competitiveness constraints along high-value agro-food chains.

N2  - Many small-scale aquaculture producers in developing countries find it challenging to access international value chains due to barriers-to-entry. To shed light on this issue, this article presents three case studies where we analyze export behavior of aquaculture producers from Honduras and Peru based on price behavior in export markets (EU and USA) and in domestic wholesale markets. The price analysis suggests that in all three value chains that include shrimp, tilapia and trout there are competitive aquaculture producers that participate in international value chains and that are able to respond to profitable opportunities when relative prices change. While some small scale producers are able to enter international chains through larger exporters, the majority seem to serve domestic markets and often markets close to the production sites.

N2  - Using an original dataset from the Vietnamese catfish sector, we study the impact of vertical coordination options on household welfare and the implications of different stages of vertical coordination for the success of the whole sector. The welfare gain from contract farming and employment on processor-owned estate farms is estimated using a maximum simulated likelihood estimator. Our results show positive welfare effects from participating in contract farming, but not from employment on processor-owned estate farms. The results imply that contract farming presents opportunities for economic growth, but additional effort is required to make the contracts more accessible to smallholders.

N2  - Pepper (Piper nigrum L.) is considered a non-traditional cash crop for enhancing local development in Costa Rica and a suitable activity for small farmers. Trade of pepper has been done by using contractual agreements between producers and processors, which provides at least three functions: insurance, incentives and information. Contracts also require a high level of commitment from contracting parties to keep the equity, efficiency, and sustainability of the trade relationship. The shift of trade conditions from a competitive to a monopsony market encouraged a group of farmers to start an association that aims to bulk and process pepper from members. Breaching contracts by members of the association endanger this effort of sustainable entrepreneurship. This usually happens when temporary market conditions yield higher procurement prices by other competitors. This situation is also worsened by the lack of proper information on production and processing costs between the contracting parties, and then, the disagreement on the procurement price fixation and payment conditions. By using a mixed integer linear optimization model, we aim to identify the 'best' price of fresh pepper traded between both parties. We make use of primary information from 12 different farms on production costs and from the association on processing costs. The model incorporates minimum required net margins for all contracting parties, while modelling the net margins of each party, the amount of traded fresh pepper and preferred contract possibilities, given different fresh pepper price scenarios. At lower prices, some of the farmers that supply pepper, do this to just break-even. At higher prices, more is supplied by more farmers. Under monopsony conditions and individual contracts between parties, it is in the interest of the buyer to offer higher fresh pepper prices in order to buy and process more pepper, up to the point that the marginal costs of buying more pepper are equal to the marginal benefits of that extra pepper. This is because the processor has fixed costs, next to variable costs. Higher volumes reduce the average total costs of processing per kg of pepper, and thereby increase profit. When group contracts are possible, thus under bilateral monopoly conditions--farmers acting as 'one' seller and the processor as the only buyer--more fresh pepper is supplied at higher prices than under monopsony conditions as more farmers would have higher surpluses. At the same time the processor would have a higher profit than using individual contracts.

N2  - Smallholder producers are the collective most likely to be affected by the introduction of GMOs globally, yet the least included in public debates and consultation about the development, implementation or regulation of this agricultural biotechnology. Why are the voices and arguments of smallholder farmers being excluded from national and international GM debates and regulation? In this article, we identify barriers which prevent smallholder farmers in Mexico from having a voice in public political, economic, scientific and social fora regarding the GM maize controversy. Through the analysis of empirical data from a case study in Mexico, we identify political, institutional, economic and ontological reasons that lie behind that exclusion. We conclude with an appraisal of smallholder farmers' perspectives on GM maize and their visions of Mexico's rural future, within which they demand a meaningful and rightful space.

N2  - Egypt has one of the world's largest aquaculture sectors which makes a significant contribution to income, employment creation and food security. However, there are very limited data available on the farmed tilapia value chain. The aim of this study therefore was to characterise production, marketing and consumption patterns of farmed tilapia in the Nile Delta of Egypt. A cross sectional study was conducted to collect data from tilapia producers (100), transporters (32), retailers (100), fish fry shops (20) and households (300) in three case study communities (fish producing, peri-urban and rural community). We conducted structured questionnaire interviews and participatory assessments for producers and consumers. Focus group discussions with mothers were also held to collect data for the availability, sources and consumption patterns of tilapia. Results showed that, more than half of producers were small scale, having a farm size of 10 feddan or less (1 feddan = 4200m[superscript 2]). The main water supply for almost all farms was agricultural drain water, a potential source of contamination with chemical and biological hazards. The main production constraints were reported to be feed prices, water quality and availability, land rent, fuel and energy sources and environmental conditions. The farmed tilapia value chain was short with some value added in the form of marketing fresh and live fish as well as selling tilapia in fried or grilled form. The majority of produced tilapia was transported to retail sale and sold to consumers as fresh, while only a small proportion was processed by cleaning, grilling or frying. A lack of hygiene during transportation and marketing of farmed tilapia was found that could be potential sources for post-harvesting contamination. The availability and frequency of tilapia consumption were higher in the community in the production areas than in other communities. In non-producing areas, tilapia may be available in the market once a week during the village market day. Potential areas for further research in order to improve safety, quality and production of farmed tilapia were identified.

N2  - The purpose of this paper is to look at the ever-popular "value-chain approach" for linking smallholder farmers to high value export markets. Conventional wisdom says that value chains undertaken for development purposes redistribute risk and provide benefits and services to participants that are otherwise difficult or impossible to obtain. The authors take a farmer-centric approach and ask farmers participating in these higher value chains if they perceive greater or different risks, and compare the results to their conventional counterparts. The authors also ask what benefits they associate with participation and if they believe they believe those benefits are exclusive to value chain participation. The authors collect data from growers in three different cocoa value chains in Ashanti, Ghana. These chains include one focussed on certified production practices (Rainforest Alliance), one that focussed on high-value product characteristics (Fine Flavor) and a conventional chain, which serves as a counterfactual. The paper finds differences in perceptions of participation risks and benefits--particularly among price risks--that appear to filter based on value chain membership. However, for many risks, value chain participation seems to do little to redistribute potential production shocks. With some exceptions, growers report that many of the benefits they enjoy as a result of participation could feasibly be accessed by other sources.

N2  - We study the effect of alleviating the information asymmetry regarding product quality that is widespread in contracts between agricultural producers and buyers in developing countries. Opportunistic buyers may underreport quality levels to farmers to reduce the price that they have to pay. In response, farmers may curb investment, thereby negatively affecting farm productivity. In an experiment, we entitle randomly selected smallholder dairy farmers in Vietnam, who are contracted by a large company, to independently verify milk testing results. Results indicate that treatment farmers use 12% more inputs, and they also increase their output significantly. Some wider research and policy implications are discussed.

N2  - This paper analyses the impact of individual farmers' participation in the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi (NASFAM). Precisely the paper analyses the effect of participation on credit market access, fertilizer use and total incomes of its participants in the Kasungu district of Malawi. NASFAM is a form of producer cooperative with a number of socio-economic functions. Using data on income per capita, fertilizer expenditure and access to credit, this paper tests the hypothesis that participation in NASFAM positively impacted incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition. Employing Propensity Score Matching methodology to estimate Average Treatment Effects (ATT) on programme members, this paper finds evidence that participation in NASFAM had a positive effect on all the endogenous variables. Membership enhances household level incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition and is hence in line with national goals of poverty reduction, the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) principles, the SADC's Regional Indicative Strategy Development Plan (RISDP) and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Based on these findings and the fact that credit and fertilizer access are still problematic in Malawi's rural areas, it appears that there is great need for NASFAM to expand to areas where it currently does not have activities. Such expansion would ensure food security over a wider range of rural households through improved input access.

N2  - Vegetables are sources of vitamins, minerals and income for those involved in production and marketing. Having first-hand information about vegetable production and marketing system is essential to devise appropriate strategies aimed at enhancing vegetable value chain development. It was in line with this view that a study was conducted to characterize vegetable production and marketing systems at selected sites in the humid tropics of Ethiopia. Data were collected using participatory primary survey techniques augmented with secondary data. While the area cultivated to vegetables has been increasing over the years due to increasing consumer demand, average yields are far below potential. Major vegetable production and marketing constraints include: lack of access to improved variety seeds, high postharvest losses, lack of reliable market information systems, low bargaining power of farmers, low technological know-how for value chain development and upgrading, all indicating critical areas of intervention. Increasing public awareness the nutritional importance of vegetables will critically help in reducing malnutrition while increasing smallholder household income.

N2  - The study examined the patterns and determinants of agricultural credit use among farming households in Oyo State, Nigeria. The primary data used for the study were obtained from a cross sectional survey of 114 farm households drawn by multi-stage random sampling technique. Both descriptive statistics and multiple regressions were used to analyze the data obtained. The study revealed that 47.4% of farm households in the State were in the age bracket of 51-60 years with mean age of 58 years while majority (86.8%) were farmers. Also, 48.2% had no formal education and 22.8% had between 7-12 years of formal education. Over half of the farm households (58%) maintained a household size of 5-8 with mean size of five while 27.2% and 26.3% had between 11-20 years and 21-30 years of farming experience. In addition, 52% of the respondents in the State patronized the cooperative societies with mean loan requested as 108,157.89 Naira, mean loan released as 97,763.15 Naira and mean loan repaid being 70,898.24 Naira. The major constraints faced by the rural farm households in accessing loans include high interest rate (21.9%) and lack of collateral (14.9%). Farm size (p < 0.01), membership of a social organization (p < 0.01), number of adult males in households (p < 0.01) and off farm income (p < 0.05) had positive significant influence on the amount of credit the household can secure. The adjusted R2 of 60.7% indicates that 60.7% of the variations in the amount of credit/loan obtained were explained by the specified variables in the model. The study recommends that government should organize, strengthen and harmonize the activities of the various cooperative societies with the aim of making them more effective in microcredit utilization.

N2  - China's economy is experiencing a regime shift away from a fully elastic supply of labor from a large pool of rural surplus labor and toward a situation of increasing labor scarcity and rising wage rates. Moreover, faster wage increases in the regions of origin of many rural-urban migrants are likely to affect the dynamics of inter-regional migration. These wage trends have implications at the local level, in particular in a setting in which migration connects rural communities to the national labor market and in which migration is of high importance for the livelihoods of rural households. Taking a village perspective, this article develops a village computable general equilibrium model to study local impacts of current wage trends in China. As a central piece of the model, the role of access to migration for household livelihoods is recognized. Access to migration is linked to household demographics and included in the model through a composite utility function that captures household preferences and disutilities associated with alternative off-farm activities. Simulation results illustrate how households' utility considerations affect migration responses to national wage changes. Statements about possible impacts on village level labor supply, land use, and agricultural production are made. When migration wages and local off-farm wages are simulated to increase, an overall increase in household and village migration and a higher supply of labor to local off-farm labor markets is accompanied by a contraction of farm production. Although land is reallocated between households with different migration responses, total agricultural output declines.

N2  - The determinants and impacts of farm household participation in collective action for irrigation management in Chhattisgarh, India, are analyzed. Wealth or land holdings are not factors affecting participation, but minority castes are disproportionately less likely to participate. Participation is found to increase sufficiency of water in the canal, but not land productivity or per capita incomes. This highlights some of the major challenges with collective action that provides greater equality in access, but insufficient incentives to participate.

N2  - Contractual arrangements between farmers and traders aiming at providing input/credit in return for output selling have been widely studied in the literature on agricultural economics. Nonetheless, there is one issue, which is barely mentioned in the literature: how to enforce the contract terms when traders offer credit in cash rather than input advances? This article aims to describe an innovation in farming contracts, used by fresh fruit and vegetable wholesalers in Turkey, which involves a kind of private voucher system. Drawing on original data collected from wholesalers--a segment in the supply chain hardly covered in the literature--we investigate the factors determining contract adoption using a two-limit Tobit model. Our results suggest that this private voucher system contributes to supply chain coordination and facilitates smallholder farmer participation in export and supermarket channels, which are growing rapidly in this developing country.

N2  - This paper addresses the problem of social interactions and the lender-borrower relationship by measuring the disconnect between borrowers and lenders across a wide range of lending-related attributes. The degree by which lenders and borrowers connect disconnect depends on whether lenders' and borrowers' perceptions across these attributes are symmetric or asymmetric. We compare field survey results from 120 loan officers at Rural Credit Cooperatives (RCCs) in China's coastal Shandong province, and pair them with an existing survey on identical questions to 394 farm households in the same region. Pairing lenders' perception towards borrowers regarding RCC microcredit lending mechanism, against borrowers' perception towards lenders and how themselves were perceived by lenders in the same regards, we observe on many dimensions a disconnect between them in the context of lenders' "care" towards borrowers, loan rejection, memberships of RCC and group guarantee, lending concerns, cost of borrowing, reasons for default, credit rationing, and lending preferences. This research provides financial institutions with outreach mechanisms to borrowers, while also training lenders to borrowers' sensitivities.

N2  - Over the last six decades, international development assistance agencies have tried to introduce innovations in developing countries to stimulate development and improve the quality of life of the poor. The results have been mixed. This paper presents the results of an evaluation of a project introducing modern beekeeping practices to increase household incomes among small farmers in Vietnam. The Project exceeded its targets in terms of the number of farmers who adopted the innovation and the number of households with increased incomes. The farmers also reported development benefits beyond those originally envisioned--improved health, happier family relationships, and greater respect. The successful diffusion is attributed to the readily observable, personally and collectively felt benefits of beekeeping, harmony with the social practice of sharing, and the efforts of the change agent to reduce the complexity of the innovation and to integrate local farmers' knowledge in the training and extension activities.

N2  - During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, fixed-rent tenancy gradually replaced sharecropping as the dominant form of land tenancy in China. This paper hypothesizes that the secular shift in land tenure was an adaptation to the change in land utilization system towards more intensive cropping. To test the hypothesis we exploit a dataset gathered from the rent collection archives of Confucius' Lineage in the Qing Dynasty. We estimate the effect of the adoption of wheat-soybean double cropping on the choice of tenancy contract, share contract versus fixed-rent contract. We find that double cropped plots were 23.7% more likely to be managed under fixed-rent contracts than annually cropped plots. Our findings are consistent with the implications of the factor endowment theory. The adoption of double cropping made farming more complex and placed greater demands on managerial inputs of tenants. In the absence of a factor market for managerial ability, optimal tenancy contract had adapted to provide tenants with a greater incentive to supply managerial inputs than had been the case in sharecropping arrangements.

N2  - There is lack of consensus in the literature on the impact of contract farming on the welfare of smallholder farmers. Some authors argue that contact farming improves access to markets, hence income, while others view contract farming as an avenue by which large corporations exploit smallholder farmers. It is thus seen as a blessing to some but a necessary evil to others. This study examines the factors influencing participation in poultry contract farming in Kenya. It then uses propensity score matching technique to assess the impact of contract poultry production. The study finds, among others, that farmer-specific factors, transaction costs and financial asset endowment affect participation in contract farming. It also finds that contracted farmers earned more net income per bird than their counterparts. It concludes that participation in contract farming practice improves the welfare smallholder poultry farmers in Kenya. The study discusses the policy implications of the findings.

N2  - Rural producer associations are considered a potential community-driven solution to the problems of smallholder agriculture. This article evaluates the impact of organising female farmers into producer associations in Gujarat, India. The initiative provided training, information, access to inputs, risk mitigation, and market linkages. Over 18 months, the programme weakly increased members' non-farm income and access to output markets. It had stronger impacts on members' awareness and utilisation of financial services. Impacts were heterogeneous, varying by pre-existing socioeconomic conditions. These findings suggest that producer associations can lower transaction costs for smallholders, but that poverty alleviation may be a longer-term prospect.

N2  - Despite volumes of research and substantial investments by government, the financial performance of smallholder farmers in South Africa remains poor. The past decade saw little change in the general behaviour of smallholder farmers, and the stumbling blocks faced by smallholder farmers who want to participate in commercial agri-food chains. A possible reason may be that researchers tend to focus on the current behaviour and performance of the farmers while neglecting the influence of the incentive structure on their behaviour. The aim of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework that allows for a more holistic analysis of farmers and their value chains to better understand the reasons underlying current behaviour, and to identify potential solutions to change the behaviour of the farmers and relevant role-players to better match the requirements for successfully participating in competitive agri-food chains. The integrated value chain, New Institutional Economics--Structure-Conduct-Performance framework, does allow for a comprehensive analysis of the incentive structure embedded in the social, physical and institutional environment within which the farmers operate. Special attention is also awarded to the relationship between the farmers and their buyers to identify the appropriate coordination strategy that will minimise transaction costs.

N2  - For many smallholders, agriculture is the main source of income, understanding how value chains work can derive many benefits to increase productivity and therefore farmers' income. Many different stakeholders around the world are involved in the cocoa value chain, which is part of a billion-dollar chocolate industry. Cocoa farming in many developing countries is the main source of income for households. West Africa is the most important cocoa-producing area worldwide, accounting for 70 percent of the total production. In Ghana, small-scale farmers, with plantations of no more than 4 hectares, are responsible for most of the national production. This investigation sought to determine if the interactions of these farmers with different local and international stakeholders were improving their situation. The study took place in two main cocoa producer regions in Ghana, Brong Ahafo and Western. Three hundred small scale farmers in 20 different villages were interviewed. Interviews of different key stakeholders in Ghana, such as COCOBOD and in Switzerland, Felchlin AG, Chocolats Halba and Chocosuisse were conducted. This study focused on identifying the relationships, support, benefits and/or problems between stakeholders (national and international) and small scale farmers. On the other hand, the issue of contract farming and its impact on cocoa farmers in Ghana was analyzed. The results indicate that small scale farmers have little or no contact with stakeholders especially with chocolate manufacturers, the lack of farming contracts is high in other regions and if farmers work under contract there is little or no information about contracting terms and conditions. Awareness of sustainable production or certifications to motivate better producer price among farmers is also missing. Finally, a participatory value chain analysis is proposed in order to improve relationships between farmers and stakeholders.

N2  - This paper uses framed choice experiments to examine the preferences of smallholder farmers in Malawi regarding alternative policy-based incentives to adopt conservation practices that reduce soil erosion and increase yields. The policy incentives offered in the choice experiments included an ideal index-based crop insurance contract, an index insurance contract with basis risk, cash payments, and fertilizer subsidies. Prior to implementing the choice experiments, the farmers participated in a workshop utilizing small group-based dynamic learning games that demonstrated how index-based crop insurance contracts function. The choice experiment results indicate that most farmers preferred cash payments to index insurance contracts, even when the insurance contracts offered substantially higher expected returns. Further, more risk averse farmers were more likely to prefer cash payments than less risk averse and risk loving farmers.

N2  - Purpose--Beer-bananas in Central Uganda are important for smallholder farmers' livelihoods, especially for those that process the banana into beer and spirits. The purpose of this paper is to understand how actors in the beer-banana value chain are affected and how they are managing disease has become an important issue since the outbreak of the bacterial banana disease Xanthomonas Wilt. Design/methodology/approach--The authors conducted an exploratory study focusing on producers of beer-bananas; brewers and non-brewers, and on retailers in Central Uganda and in Kampala. The authors conducted surveys with these value chain actors and we used baseline data, collected through a household survey in the project sites. Findings--Results showed that Banana Xanthomonas Wilt (BXW) has drastically reduced productivity of beer-banana systems, resulting in reduced sales volumes of beer-bananas and processed products and consequently reduced incomes. Application of disease control measures was generally higher among those farmers that brew. Research limitations/implications--This being an exploratory study, the samples for the different value chain actors were rather small. Future research should address: product quality and opportunities for differentiation; effects of beer-banana processing on rural communities; adoption of BXW control measures. Originality/value--Beer-bananas are often neglected in research; this paper shows that is unfounded since beer-banana production and processing are important for many people's livelihood. More insight into what motivates farmers to control the disease is essential to protect these people's livelihoods.

N2  - There is considerable controversy about the impact of biofuels on food security in developing countries. A major concern is that biofuels reduce food security by increasing food prices. In this paper, we use survey evidence to assess the impact of castor production on poor and food insecure rural households in Ethiopia. About 1/3 of poor farmers have allocated on average 15% of their land to the production of castor beans under contract in biofuel supply chains. Castor production significantly improves their food security: they have fewer months without food and the amount of food they consume increases. Castor cultivation is beneficial for participating households' food security in several ways: by generating cash income from castor contracts, they can store food for the lean season; castor beans preserve well on the field which allows sales when farmers are in need of cash (or food); spillover effects of castor contracts increases the productivity of food crops. Increased food crop productivity offsets the amount of land used for castor so that the total local food supply is not affected.

N2  - This paper assesses how tenure reform in China's collective forest sector affects Chinese farmer households' perception of tenure security and propensity to invest in their forestland. A large database consisting of information from 3,180 households in eight provinces from south to north is used to explore factors correlated with more strongly perceived tenure security and determinants of forest-related investment. The study adds to the limited research testing whether there is endogenous causality between investment and tenure security in forestland, and finds that investment was not undertaken to enhance tenure security. In addition, the data allow for differentiation between perceived tenure security and contracted use and transferability rights. Overall, stronger contracted rights were found to affect investment. China's forest tenure reform - where individual households can manage forestland, empowered by legal certification and stronger contract rights - has thus enhanced tenure security and encouraged forest investment.

N2  - Efforts to unlock the genetic potential of both rice and fish, when combined with improvements in the management of rice-fish systems, can potentially increase agricultural productivity and food security in some of the poorest and most populous countries in Asia. In Bangladesh, estimates suggest that the country's potential rice-fish production system encompasses 2-3 million hectares of land. But despite three decades of research on biophysical and technical aspects of rice-fish systems, this potential has not been fully realized due to insufficient attention given to the social, economic, and policy dimensions of rice-fish system improvement. This paper provides a characterization of the diverse and changing nature of rice-fish systems in Bangladesh to shed new light on the economic viability of different rice-fish systems and recommend policy and investment options to accelerate the development of appropriate rice-fish technologies. Data are drawn from a novel subdistrict-level survey of fishery officers, a household/enterprise survey, focus group discussions, and a meta-review of the literature on aquaculture in the country, all of which were conducted in 2010-2011. Findings indicate that concurrent rice-fish systems, alternating rice-fish systems, and collectively managed systems offer considerable potential for increasing productivity and farm incomes in Bangladesh. Findings also suggest that while innovation in these rice-fish systems is being driven by households and communities, there is need for more supportive government policies and investments to enable further innovation. Policymakers need to develop effective regulations to promote feed and fish quality and quantity, for example. More rigorous analysis of the intended and unintended impacts of these policies and investments is also necessary.

N2  - As countries increasingly strive to transform their economies from agriculture-based into a diversified one, land rental will become of greater importance. It will thus be critical to complement research on the efficiency of specific land rental arrangements such as sharecropping with an inquiry into the broader productivity impacts of the land rental market. Plot-level data for a matched landlord-tenant sample in an environment where sharecropping dominates allow us to explore both issues. We find that pure output sharing leads to significantly lower levels of efficiency that can be attenuated by monitoring while the inefficiency disappears if inputs are shared as well. Rentals transfer land to more productive producers but realization of this productivity advantage is prevented by the inefficiency of contractual arrangements, suggesting changes that would prompt adoption of different contractual arrangements could have significant benefits.

N2  - Fairtrade initially was limited to improving the lives of small-scale and peasant farmers, but later on it embraced commercial farmers, which attracted criticism. While there are a number of justifications for the Fairtrade organization's decision, there are authors who feel that meaningful "fair trade" cannot be achieved with the inclusion of commercial farms. This paper investigates the impact of Fairtrade on commercial farms and small-scale farmer cooperatives in South Africa. Fairtrade on South African commercial farms embraces a number of policy concerns related to land reform, BEE and sustainable development. The results of the study show that when commercial farms are included in the Fairtrade model, communities in which these farmers live benefit from developmental projects. In addition, in some instances, farm workers gain shares in the commercial farms, and benefit from the farm owners' knowledge and capital.

N2  - Purpose--The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of a household's social capital in the form of community group participation and empirically analyses the roles that social capital plays in helping rural households rebuild productive assets after shocks. Design/methodology/approach--In this paper, social capital is modelled as a household's intensity of group participation measured by the density and active participation in group activities as well as their multiplicative and additive indices. Instrumental variable methods were used to address the problem of endogeneity associated with social capital. Findings--The results indicate that household characteristics such as age, education level, dependence ratio and years of village residence as well as village-level characteristics such as the village population density are critical determinants of social capital. In addition, social capital measured in form of density of participation in group activities and attendance score as well as multiplicative and additive indices of these have significant positive effects on the household ability to rebuild livestock assets. Research limitations/implications--The authors realize that several weakness in the approach could compromise the validity of the findings. These weaknesses include: the cross-sectional nature of the data, the omitted variable bias, the endogeneity concerns of social capital and the identification strategy, sample size and the dimensions the authors chose to measure social capital. Future research should explore the factors that can help households to engage more in-group activities. Practical implications--The findings have important implications for government policy especially in areas of agricultural development and poverty reduction. Specifically, governments should pay close attention to the various social groups as they can serve as important channels to achieve better social economic outcomes, including the accumulation of rural assets, as is the case with livestock assets in rural Uganda. Social implications--Many governments in Sub-Saharan Africa are constrained to provide basic public goods to the people. This is due to a combination of limited budgets and lack of good leadership. In such circumstances, the people have to rely on their collective/social effort to take advantage of market opportunities. Such opportunities can be accessed using the existing social structures whose norms and the trust between members permit cooperation. Originality/value--The study contributes to a small but growing empirical literature on social groups and how they can mediate social economic outcomes especially for rural households. The empirical estimations take into consideration the endogeneity concerns associated with social network capital. The paper will be useful for policy makers and researchers who may have a keen interest in the roles that group activities play in agricultural development and poverty reduction.

N2  - While Contract Farming (CF) can enhance smallholders' income in developing countries, empirical research on the motivation of smallholders to participate in CF is scarce. This paper explores farmer preferences for particular contract design attributes. We combined analytical hierarchy process and discrete choice experiments to investigate the importance of contract design attributes. On the basis of data collected among potato farmers in Ethiopia, we found that input market uncertainty is more important than output market uncertainty in smallholders' decision to participate. Farmers tend to minimize their risk by opting for the buyer firm above the state and NGOs as providers of seed, inputs, and technical assistance. The results imply that the success of a CF scheme depends on the willingness of the firm to incorporate the preferred contract design attributes. Institutional intervention in the input market could induce agribusiness firms to offer attractive contracts for smallholders.

N2  - We analyze the individualization of farm units in Mali in the sense of a transformation of purely collective farms into mixed units in which private plots coexist with collective fields. Since a moral-hazard-in-team problem plagues production on the latter and the household head extracts his income from it, he faces a trade-off between efficiency and capture. We show, within the framework of a patriarchal farm household model, that private plots become profitable for the head once land becomes sufficiently scarce. Specifically, greater land scarcity raises both the probability to find private plots in a farm and the share of farmland allocated to these plots. On the basis of firsthand data collected in southern Mali, we test and confirm the two predictions yielded by the above theory. Moreover, we show that a higher number of married men within the household has the same effect as land scarcity, thus suggesting an interesting refinement of the moral-hazard-in-team argument.

N2  - Our paper examines how credit markets operate through wealth to influence households' entrepreneurial choices. Our results show that policy-led bank branch withdrawal in rural China has a significant negative impact on credit availability to rural households, though unexpectedly the effect is felt more strongly in informal than formal credit markets. Furthermore, we observe that self-employment is impeded by reductions in wealth associated with credit contraction. Policies which provide more and better formal financial services to rural households are predicted to increase the flow of credit, through both formal and informal channels, thereby supporting accumulation, diversification, and economic growth.

N2  - This paper analyzes the effects of social influence and participation in collective action initiatives on soil conservation effort among smallholder farmers in Lake Naivasha basin, Kenya. We apply binary and ordered probit models in a two stage regression procedure to cross-sectional data collected through a household survey among randomly selected smallholder farmers. Smallholder farming systems in the research area are associated with practices that render farmlands susceptible to soil erosion causing negative impacts on land and the environment. Therefore, strategies that encourage soil conservation are likely to also offer solutions for dealing with agri-environmental challenges and poverty alleviation. Results indicate that social capital facilitates participation in collective action initiatives which then influence individual soil conservation efforts. Neighborhood social influences, subjective norms, gender, education level, farm size, access to credit, and livestock ownership also emerge as key determinants of soil conservation effort. Policy implications drawn by this study encourage strategies to increase participation and effectiveness in collective action initiatives as a boost to soil conservation. Implementation of soil conservation practices could also be encouraged through awareness increasing instruments, facilitating access to agricultural micro-credit and paying attention to gender related challenges on knowledge access and rights over land and other natural resources.

N2  - The Indian Government's National Biogas and Manure Management Programme (NBMMP) seeks to deliver renewable energy services to households across the country by facilitating the deployment of family-sized (<6 m[superscript 3]) anaerobic (biogas) digesters. NBMMP policy is implemented at three levels, from government and state nodal agency, via private contractors to households, creating multiple institutional arrangements. We analysed the scheme in Assam, north-east India, focusing on how policy was implemented across two districts and interviewing stakeholders in rural households, state, and non-state institutions. The top-down, supply-side approach to policy enables government to set targets and require individual states to deploy the scheme, which benefits households who can afford to participate. NBMMP delivered improved energy service outcomes to a majority of households, although the level of knowledge and understanding of the technology amongst users was limited. Training and education of householders, and particularly women, is needed in relation to the maintenance of digesters, feedstock suitability, and the environmental and potential livelihood benefits of digestate. A revised bottom-up approach to policy, which highlights the contextual and demand-side issues around adopting the technology, may deliver monetary benefits from market competition and enable development of community-focused microfinance schemes to improve the affordability of biogas systems.

N2  - This article presents a mixed-method approach used to analyse the impact of a complex agricultural development project, the SOGUIPAH (Guinean Oil Palms and Rubber Company) project designed to promote oil palm and rubber cultivation in Guinea. At farm level, the combination of a farming system analysis and an economic analysis with a counterfactual scenario enables us to quantify impact on the farmers' income and to account for related impact heterogeneity. These comparisons reveal a somewhat limited impact of the project as a whole, though with a considerable heterogeneity across the types of farm households it reaches.

N2  - Maize is the most important food staple in Eastern and Southern Africa, with a highly seasonal production but relatively constant consumption over the year. Farmers have to store maize to bridge seasons, for food security and to protect against price fluctuations. However, the traditional storage methods do not protect grain well, resulting in large postharvest losses. Hermetically sealed metal silos kill storage pests by oxygen deprivation without pesticides. Popular in Central America, they are now being promoted in Africa, but their impact here has not yet been studied. This study used propensity score matching to evaluate the impact of metal silos on duration of maize storage, loss abatement, cost of storage, and household food security. Metal silo adopters (N = 116) were matched with non-adopting farmers from a representative sample of 1340 households covering the major maize-growing zones in Kenya. The major effect of the metal silos was an almost complete elimination of losses due to insect pests, saving farmers an average of 150-200 kg of grain, worth KSh9750 (US$130). Metal silo adopters also spent about KSh340 less on storage insecticides. Adopters were able to store their maize for 1.8-2.4 months longer, and to sell their surplus after five months at good prices, instead of having to sell right after the harvest. The period of inadequate food provision among adopters was reduced by more than one month. We conclude that metal silos are effective in reducing grain losses due to maize-storage insects, and that they have a large impact on the welfare and food security of farm households. The initial cost of metal silos is high (KSh20,000/1.8 ton) and therefore policies to increase access to credit, to reduce the cost of sheet metal, and to promote collective action can improve their uptake by smallholder farmers.

N2  - Purpose--The purpose of this paper is to investigate how social network capital may facilitate agricultural household market access in Uganda. Specifically, the paper investigates if social network capital has significant positive effects on the ability of households to receive higher prices for coffee. Design/methodology/approach--In this paper, social network capital is modeled using a household utility maximisation problem that is dependent on consumption and social interactions. The authors assume that social network capital mediates economic benefits through its effect on information flow, market intelligence and collective bargaining. The paper uses two-stage least square econometric methods to investigate whether group involvement at the household level helps farmers to access markets with higher prices. Findings--The findings indicate that social network capital, measured in form of density of participation and attendance score, and multiplicative and additive indices of these, have significant positive effects on the ability to receive higher prices for coffee. Research limitations/implications--The authors realise that several weaknesses in the approach could compromise the validity of the findings. These weaknesses include: the cross-sectional nature of the data, the omitted variable bias, the endogeneity concerns of social capital, sample size and the dimensions that the paper chooses to capture social network capital. Future research should explore the factors that can help households to engage more in group activities. Practical implications--The findings have important implications for government policy especially in areas of agricultural development and poverty reduction. Specifically, governments should pay close attention to various social groups as they can serve as important channels to achieve better market outcomes, as is the for coffee prices in rural Uganda. Social implications--Many governments in Sub Saharan Africa are constrained to provide basic public goods to the people. This is due to a combination of limited budgets and lack of good leadership. In such circumstances, the people have to rely on their collective/social effort to take advantage of markets opportunities. Such opportunities can be accessed using the existing social structures whose norms and the trust between members permit cooperation. Originality/value--The study contributes to a small but growing empirical literature on social groups and how they can mediate social economic outcomes especially for rural households. The empirical estimations take into consideration the endogeneity concerns associated with social network capital. The paper will be useful for policy makers and researchers who may have a keen interest in the roles that group activities play in agricultural development and poverty reduction.

N2  - We present results of experimental games with smallholder farmers in Tigray, Ethiopia, in 2010, in which participants in the games allocated money across risk management options. One of the options was index insurance that was the same as commercial products sold locally. Participants exhibited clear preferences for insurance contracts with higher frequency payouts and for insurance over other risk management options, including high interest savings. The preference for higher frequency payouts is mirrored in commercial sales of the product, with commercial purchasers paying substantially higher premiums than the minimal, low frequency option available. This combined evidence challenges claims that the very poor universally choose minimal index insurance coverage and supports concerns that demand may outpace supply of responsible insurance products.

N2  - In this article we examine which farmers would be early entrants into weather-index insurance markets in Ethiopia, were such markets to develop on a large scale. We do this by examining the determinants of willingness to pay for weather insurance among 1,400 Ethiopian households that have been tracked for 15 years as part of the Ethiopian Rural household Survey. This provides both historical and current information with which to assess the determinants of demand. We find that educated, wealthier individuals are more likely to purchase insurance. Risk aversion is associated with low insurance take-up suggesting that models of technology adoption can inform the purchase and spread of weather index insurance. We also assess how willingness to pay varied as two key characteristics of the contract were varied and found that basis risk reduces demand for insurance particularly when the price of the contract is high, and that provision of insurance through groups is preferred by female headed households and individuals with lower levels of education.

N2  - Palm oil comprises the fastest growing monoculture in the world and is used for food, cosmetics, and agrofuels. This article analyzes the attempts to guarantee the sustainable production of palm oil and agrofuels through voluntary certification schemes such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) from a critical state and hegemony theory perspective. Rather than seeing the RSPO as a voluntary and nongovernmental instrument that represents the interests of all concerned stakeholders equally, I analyze the roundtable as part of a transnational network state that is characterized by strategic selectivities, that is, some interests and strategies are privileged over others. Based on expert interviews in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore and the analysis of primary documents I conclude that the RSPO privileges business interests in general and export-oriented palm oil companies and downstream industries along the value chain in particular, whereas smallholders, plantation workers, and indigenous peoples are marginalized through different structures and processes, contributing to an actual depoliticization of socioecological conflicts.

N2  - Concerned about national food self-sufficiency and rural household incomes, in 2004 China decided to reverse its longstanding policy of taxing farm households and instead began to provide them with subsidies. Since 2004, annual announcements have trumpeted rises in subsidies. Despite the historic turnaround of policy and likely implication of this subsidy policy to China's food economy, there has been little household level survey-based research that has sought to understand the nature of China's subsidy programs from the viewpoint of the farmer. Using data from two sets of household-based surveys (covering tens of thousands of households and most major producing provinces) and survey data from government, in this paper we examine the subsidies that are directly given to farmers, one of the newest and relatively high profiles components of China's subsidy programs. We focus on China's grain, input, seed, and machinery subsidy programs. According to the survey-based findings, we show that although agricultural subsidies per farm are low, on a per hectare basis the rate of subsidies is high. Almost all producers are receiving them. Subsidies are mostly being given to the land contractor, not the tiller. Most of grain, input, and seed subsidies are non-distorting, but machinery subsidy is based on farmers' actual purchase of machineries.

N2  - Purpose--Integrating smallholders into high-value global markets represents a unique opportunity to effect large-scale poverty reduction in the countryside. The purpose of the paper is to add empirical evidence to the discussion of how to best incorporate smallholders into the formal economy sustainably and responsibly. Design/methodology/approach--The paper first builds a theoretical framework around global value chain theory and literature on smallholder inclusion and Kenya's growing horticultural sector. It then moves to explore a Kenyan smallholder-based business model that incorporates 4,000 flower producers through an efficient and transparent intermediary. The analysis focuses on the importance of governance, upgrading and strong intermediaries for including smallholders in horticultural value chains. Findings--In conclusion, this paper finds that although smallholder inclusion is both favorable and feasible based on theory, literature, and case study analysis, it remains limited. It proposes embracing innovative smallholder-based business models as a viable path out of poverty in countries with low labor costs, suitable climatic conditions, and basic infrastructural capacities. Research limitations/implications--Limitations include a reliance on largely qualitative research methods due to gaps in available data. Practical implications--Policy implications include the necessity of promoting agricultural development through investments in extension services, the creation of research and development centers, and improvements in the rule of law. Originality/value--This paper is unique in its focus on business models and global value chains as mechanisms through which to include smallholders into the global economy.

N2  - More than the increasing pressure on agrarian resources, land fight in Pakistan is caused by the starkly inequitable distribution of land. The land-poor and landless classes in the country, particularly in Sindh and Punjab, are dependent as sharecroppers or farm labourers on landlords. In order to escape from their life in debt bondage, more and more peasants endeavour to find a niche in low-class urban localities. Since they do not possess any skills and assets, they wander around for a livelihood of sorts at the bottom of the informal economy. The mixture of inordinately low wages and the absence of regular employment keep them entrapped in a state of pauperism. When they try to engage in collective action, mostly in industry, both employers and government officials team up to defuse their fight for higher wages and decent employment. Without a fundamental change in the policy of exclusion, and a better deal in economic, political and social terms, a majority of the country's workforce would continue to remain entrapped in sub-human standards of living. The moot question thus is as to why people would remain loyal to a State unwilling to offer them protection from immiserisation.

N2  - This paper examines the treatment effects of the agricultural cooperative and publicly funded extension services on individual household economy, using data collected by the author from watermelon-producing farm households in rural Nanjing. The cooperative addressed in this study restricts the participation of small-scale farmers, implying that selection into the program must be taken into consideration for an accurate assessment of the treatment effect. The econometric analysis revealed that government extension services have a modest effect on farm income. In contrast, the treatment effect of the agricultural cooperative is robust and substantially large, accounting for nearly 70% of the pre-matching difference. This suggests that the agricultural cooperative system is an important avenue for farmers to improve their economic status. The treatment effect of the agricultural cooperative is highly heterogeneous; the economic benefits arising from the cooperative are significant only for small-scale farms. We can argue that a coexistence of smallholder exclusion and the treatment effect in favor of small-scale farms poses serious challenges to pro-poor agricultural growth in China.

The analysis builds on a case study of food procurement in Brazil, which intended to improve the quality of food used in public schools. The case study follows ways that the promotion of quality food has localised the procurement operation, connecting smallholders to citizen-consumers. The efforts to promote quality food procurement worked to shape reflexive governance in a decentralised political environment and create an institutional device based on cooperative civic participation and state engagement. However, this process highlighted socioeconomic inequality within the country due to uneven local capacities to connect good-quality services to the citizens' everyday places. The study identifies the following paths to tackle this unevenness: improvement of place-based infrastructure; promotion of trans-local cooperation; and building on the existing informal institutional arrangements. The focus on quality and sustainability in general has been blind to the inequality in local capacities to define and promote the quality-oriented economy in the first place. Recognising inequality through a case study, the paper outlines specific ways for the author to link quality to trans-local equality.

N2  - This article investigates determinants and impacts of cooperative organization, using the example of smallholder banana farmers in Kenya. Farmer groups are inclusive of the poor, although wealthier households are more likely to join. Employing propensity score matching, we find positive income effects for active group members. Yet price advantages of collective marketing are small, and high-value market potentials have not yet been tapped. Beyond prices, farmer groups function as important catalysts for innovation adoption through promoting efficient information flows. We discuss the conditions under which collective action is useful, and through what mechanisms the potential benefits emerge.

N2  - This paper addresses the extent to which the scope of smallholder cooperatives' activities may affect their performance in marketing their members' surplus output. Previous papers have highlighted such effects and explained it by the extra burden that diversified activities impose on the often limited management capacities of these organisations. We propose an alternative explanation, linking the scope of activities to membership structure: marketing cooperatives engaging in a vast array of unrelated activities may lose their marketing-oriented members for those more interested in the new activities proposed. The model's predictions are supported by recently collected data on 172 smallholder grain marketing cooperatives in Ethiopia. Implications for the support of farmer organisations are derived and discussed in conclusion.

N2  - What is the impact of product certification on small-scale farmers' livelihoods? To what extent does the participation of Ethiopian small-scale coffee farmers in certified local cooperative structures improve their socioeconomic situation? To answer these questions, this article employs household data of 249 coffee farmers from six different cooperatives collected in the Jimma zone of Southwestern Ethiopia in 2009. Findings show that the certification of coffee cooperatives has in total a low impact on small-scale coffee producers' livelihoods mainly due to (1) low productivity, (2) insignificant price premium, and (3) poor access to credit and information from the cooperative. Differences in production and organizational capacities between the local cooperatives are mirrored in the extent of the certification benefits for the smallholders. "Good" cooperatives have reaped the benefits of certification, whereas "bad" ones did not fare well. In this regard the "cooperative effect" overlies the "certification effect."

N2  - A "supermarket revolution" has occurred in developing countries in the past 2 decades. We focus on three specific issues that reflect the impact of this revolution, particularly in Asia: continuity in transformation, innovation in transformation, and unique development strategies. First, the record shows that the rapid growth observed in the early 2000s in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand has continued, and the "newcomers"--India and Vietnam--have grown even faster. Although foreign direct investment has been important, the roles of domestic conglomerates and even state investment have been significant and unique. Second, Asia's supermarket revolution has exhibited unique pathways of retail diffusion and procurement system change. There has been "precocious" penetration of rural towns by rural supermarkets and rural business hubs, emergence of penetration of fresh produce retail that took much longer to initiate in other regions, and emergence of Asian retail developing-country multinational chains. In procurement, a symbiosis between modern retail and the emerging and consolidating modern food processing and logistics sectors has arisen. Third, several approaches are being tried to link small farmers to supermarkets. Some are unique to Asia, for example assembling into a "hub" or "platform" or "park" the various companies and services that link farmers to modern markets. Other approaches relatively new to Asia are found elsewhere, especially in Latin America, including "bringing modern markets to farmers" by establishing collection centers and multipronged collection cum service provision arrangements, and forming market cooperatives and farmer companies to help small farmers access supermarkets.

N2  - The question addressed in this article is what precisely are the benefits that small-scale farmers in the developing world receive from being members of producer-controlled vertical value chains? A baseline comparative survey was conducted of members and non-members of four vertically coordinated dairy cooperatives, three in Kenya and one in Uganda (N = 3,986), which are part of a larger five-year longitudinal cooperative study. The study measures both objective income gains and subjective satisfaction gains from cooperative membership. Cooperative members have a small but statistically significant advantage over non-members in income from dairy, but other incentives for membership are based on selective incentives (i.e., provision of non-income services to members) and social capital (i.e., trust that the cooperative will purchase their milk and pay them a fair price). These findings suggest that the motivations for cooperative membership in developing countries are not dissimilar from motivations of cooperative members in more developed countries. This coupled with similar organizational design issues suggests that greater attention should be paid to larger-scale vertically coordinated collective action models in development theory and research.

N2  - Using cross-sectional data and a propensity score matching technique, this paper investigates the impact of cooperatives on adoption of agricultural technologies. Our analysis indicates that cooperative members are more likely to be male-headed households, have better access to agricultural extension services, possess oxen, participate in off-farm work, and have leadership experience. We also found that geographic location and age of household head are strongly associated with cooperative membership. Our estimation results show that cooperative membership has a strong positive impact on fertilizer adoption. The impact on adoption of pesticides turns out to be statistically significant when only agricultural cooperatives are considered. Further analysis also suggests that cooperative membership has a heterogeneous impact on fertilizer adoption among its members. The results suggest that cooperatives can play an important role in accelerating the adoption of agricultural technologies by smallholder farmers in Ethiopia.

N2  - Small-scale agriculture is one of the few tools available to support improved rural livelihoods on a significant scale in South Africa. Access to output markets is a key factor in generating higher incomes. The rise of modern markets (supermarkets in particular) is generally viewed as positive for the rural poor, although most commentators accede that there are challenges to be overcome in obtaining access to such markets. These challenges are generally perceived as supply-side issues: That is, the "fault" for market exclusion lies largely with small producers--their production methods, their business organisation and their location--rather than with these markets themselves. This study asserts that much of the research that has been undertaken in this area is in fact incomplete, because it has excluded two key issues: The likely impact of the dominant supermarket business model on small farmers; and the actual position of small farmers in those countries with high levels of supermarket concentration. A closer examination of the supermarket model suggests it is inherently hostile towards smaller producers. The South African food retail market structure resembles that of industrialised countries rather than developing countries. Therefore, we should expect that the position of South African small farmers vis-a-vis supermarkets is similar to that of small farmers in industrialised countries, who are increasingly excluded from these value chains.

N2  - This article highlights the role of sharecropping in small-scale, non-traditional export production, through the case of pineapple production in Cote d'Ivoire. The study reveals the diversity of contractual configurations with respect to the same crop, under the same local term of abougnon. Beyond a description of contractual practices, the article explores the rationale for share contracts in a context of imperfect tenancy, labour, and credit markets. The analysis of actors' rationales in entering abougnon contracts points out the role of financing constraints and disequilibrium in the tenancy market. It highlights the secondary role played by transaction costs induced by moral hazard, incentives or--up to the crisis that struck down the sector--production and market risks. This in-depth, localised, longitudinal case study relies on first-hand data collected through intensive fieldwork conducted in the village of Djimini-Koffikro in 1983-1984 and 2002-2003, updated in 2010.

N2  - Purpose--The purpose of this paper is to identify factors that constrain marketing choices available to smallholders, limiting the chain's robustness from their perspective. Design/methodology/approach--This paper draws on transaction cost economics to develop a model explaining dyadic relationships between smallholders and their buyers. The model was used to analyse a case study of the supply chain for organic fresh vegetables in Kathmandu, Nepal. Findings--This chain is characterised mainly by relational contracting between smallholders and their buyers. There was also evidence of vertical integration by some buyers, and of growers selling on informal markets. However, there was no evidence of spot market trading or of conventional contracting. These outcomes were attributed primarily to the absence effective standards and legal systems. Despite this, the chain offered smallholders a range of dyads with different risk-reward trade-offs. Research limitations/implications--This paper is based on the findings of a case study. While the results can be generalised to theory, they cannot be generalised to other supply chains. Originality/value--This study considers supply-chain performance from the perspective of smallholders. The model proposed for the study extends the traditional vertical coordination continuum to incorporate missing dyads and informal markets.

N2  - Launched in 2001, the Thailand Village and Urban Community Fund (VF) provided almost US$ 2 billion--a million baht for each of Thailand's 78,000 villages and wards--to provide working capital for locally-run rotating credit associations. Using data from the Thailand Socioeconomic Surveys of 2002 and 2004, we find that VF borrowers were disproportionately poor and agricultural. A fixed effects model using a panel of rural households for these years finds that VF borrowing is associated with, on average, 3.5% more current spending, and 1.4% more income; very similar impacts are found using a propensity score matching model applied to nationwide data in 2004, which also found that VF loans are associated with the acquisition of more durable goods. By way of contrast, borrowing from the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives appears to have a stronger effect on income than on expenditures. The evidence also shows that the effect on expenditure (or income) of VF borrowing is strongest at the lower quantiles, and flowed disproportionately to low-income households; in both of these senses it is "pro-poor".

N2  - Agricultural cooperatives are important rural organizations supporting livelihood development and poverty reduction. In recognition of such roles of cooperatives, Ethiopia showed a renewed interest in recent years in promoting cooperative sector development. However, there is lack of a wider and systematic analysis to produce sufficient empirical evidence on the livelihood development and poverty reduction impacts of cooperatives in the country. Using a matching technique on rural household income, saving, agricultural input expenditure and asset accumulation as indicator variables, this paper evaluates the livelihood impact of agricultural cooperatives in Sidama zone, Ethiopia. The finding shows that cooperatives improved the livelihoods of service user farmers through impacting better income, more savings and reduced input costs. In view of such evidence, further promotion, deepening and supporting of agricultural cooperatives is recommended.

N2  - Prior to the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, Karakul sheep in Kazakhstan were raised mainly on large collective state farms, sovkhozes. Farmers had to meet quotas on lamb and pelt numbers and received wages, while state farms provided veterinary and breeding services, animal feed, and marketing. With the break-up of the Soviet Union, land ownership, farm facilities, animals, and payment of state farm employees were transferred to Kazakhstan. The Kazakhi government could not support such a system and encouraged privatisation by dissolving state farms in 1993. Government budget support and subsidies were discontinued and there was a lack of an adequate banking system to provide credit to farmers. As a result, farmers were forced to sell and barter livestock, mainly sheep, for labour costs, pensions, supplies, and farm maintenance needs. Today, smallholder farms produce about 90% of the livestock; however, many homesteads exist at subsistence levels due to mainly poor marketing and capital constraints.

N2  - In this article, we use farm-level data from the Punjab Province in Pakistan to analyze the impact of three tenancy contracts on investment in soil-improving and productivity-enhancing measures and farm productivity. A multivariate tobit model that accounts for potential substitutability and complementarity of investment options, as well as endogeneity of tenure arrangements was employed in the empirical analysis. Our empirical results indicate that land tenure arrangements influence farmers' decisions to invest in soil-improving and productivity-enhancing measures. In particular, owner-cultivators with secured tenancy arrangements were found to be more likely to invest in soil-improving and productivity-enhancing measures, compared to those on leased contracts. We also find that output per hectare was highest on land cultivated by owners and lowest on land under sharecropping tenancy, lending support to the Marshallian inefficiency hypothesis.

N2  - The purpose of this paper aims to explore how borrower and group-level characteristics affect repayment decisions of group borrowers by highlighting the case of rural credit cooperatives (RCCs) in Guizhou province in Southwest China. The logit model was applied to test the determinants of repayment performance of RCCs' group lending. The authors used the survey data of 245 farm households in Guizhou province, collected in 2008. The empirical results indicate that there is a serious mismatch between joint liability mechanisms and the social and economic conditions in rural China. Mechanisms such as threatening to withhold defaulters' future loans from RCCs failed to work. In addition, higher household incomes also did not improve repayment performance. However, factors such as a higher degree of acquaintanceship in a group, migrant income, and employment in government agencies, positively improved the chances of repayment.

N2  - This paper intends to contribute to the ongoing debate about whether and how restructured agri-food markets can provide viable market opportunities for small-scale farmers in South Africa. It analyses contract farming from the small-scale farmer perspective to better understand the implications for small-scale farmers of contractual arrangements with processing and/or marketing firms. The paper, based on empirical research conducted in the Limpopo Province of South Africa using a combination of qualitative and econometric analyses, argues that contract farming is not a panacea for small-scale farmers. On the one hand, contract farming improves agricultural production for contract farmers who benefit from increased incomes, enables better access to services and resources, and creates new opportunities to participate in markets. However, on the other hand, the results show that contract farming remains limited and mostly involves the already better-off, who have benefitted from specific development paths and public support. This case study shows that contract farming in itself does not appear to provide an efficient means of reducing poverty, nor does it provide an institutional tool through which to improve rural livelihoods. It does, therefore, not represent a tool appropriate for the majority of small farmers or for redressing the historical imbalances in the South African agricultural sector.

N2  - This paper explores welfare dynamics among households in rural Mozambique. Using household panel data, we test whether an asset-based poverty trap exists. Findings indicate that all rural households converge to one stable equilibrium in the medium term, which is close to the poverty line. This may indicate that households in rural Mozambique are collectively trapped in generalized underdevelopment. A drought and household coping strategies help to explain the observed poverty dynamics. Food-insecure households who have better access to income-generating opportunities and who can afford drawing on unproductive assets are able to sustain their productive asset base in the short term.

N2  - This paper assesses the impact of contract farming in the oil palm industry in Indonesia on smallholders' well-being and investigates its implication for poverty reduction. Data were collected using random sampling from 245 smallholders in the province of Jambi, Sumatra. A treatment effects model was applied in order to capture endogeneity and selection bias. Results show that participation in contract farming is significantly associated with type of household, age of household head, size of oil palm plot, and the time of plantation establishment. While contract farming has a significant positive effect on smallholder income overall, it discriminates against poorer smallholders. It is recommended that the agro industry and government review contractual arrangements in order to increase the chances of the poor benefiting from oil palm expansion in Indonesia.

N2  - Thailand is now the largest exporter of natural rubber with one third of the volume traded annually (3.252 million tons produced and 2.866 million tons exported in 2010). Beyond the quantitative performance, Thailand is distinguished by the origin of this production, because 95% of plantations are owned by family farms. Much of the transformation is further ensured by small farmer cooperatives. Currently, nearly 10% of the Thai population lives on production, trade and processing of natural rubber. Based on a literature review supplemented by some interviews with resource persons, this paper analyzes the factors behind this remarkable development of the smallholder rubber plantations in Thailand. This performance is certainly attributable to population dynamics, various forms of information flow but also and above all, it seems the result of a public policy commitment for nearly 50 years. The main factors of quantitative and qualitative development of natural rubber plantations, detailed in this paper, have been the result of long term public measures concerning different levels of the sector. In addition, much of this development was funded by the industry itself, by a para-fiscal levy on exported volumes of natural rubber. In addition to a remarkable agricultural intensification, which mainly concerns areas of historical emergence of the rubber production in Thailand, the state has also encouraged the geographical expansion of rubber plantations in the northern regions of the country. In this context less favorable in terms of soil and climate conditions, the adoption of the rubber production is still relatively low but it has enjoyed remarkable growth in recent years. In high production regions of natural rubber in southern Thailand, the dependence of farmers' income on rubber is very important. Pursuing an objective of fighting against poverty, the State is also ready, as it did in 2009, to intervene on stocks to regulate prices when registering excessively downward. In doing so, the State helps to maintain the scope of this production.

N2  - Contract farming is widely perceived as a means of increasing welfare in developing countries. Because of smallholder self-selection in contract farming, however, it is not clear whether contract farming actually increases grower welfare. In an effort to improve upon existing estimates of the welfare impacts of contract farming, this paper uses the results of a contingent-valuation experiment to control for unobserved heterogeneity among smallholders. Using data across several regions, firms, and crops in Madagascar, results indicate that a 1-percent increase in the likelihood of participating in contract farming is associated with a 0.5-percent increase in household income, among other positive impacts.

N2  - Kerala is the nearly monopolistic contributor to the natural rubber production of India with 90% of the total production and 78% of the area under cultivation in the country. The natural rubber production of the state during 2010-11 was 7.71 lakh tonnes and the coverage under the crop was 5.34 lakh ha. The productivity in Kerala was found to be less compared to the national average, i.e., 1419 against 1784 kg/ha, during 2009-10. In Kerala, around 40 per cent of the area as well as 45 per cent of production of rubber comes from three districts; Kottayam, Ernakulam and Pathanamthitta and small holders contributed 92.5 3% to the total production. Trend analysis using index numbers showed that over a period of last 25 years, the area under rubber and its productivity increased to an extent of 46 per cent and 135 per cent respectively and resulted in 244 per cent rise in NR production in Kerala. The instability in area, production and productivity during the period were 2.56, 5.84 and 6.37 per cent respectively. The decomposition analysis showed that the yield effect is contributing nearly two fold to the total production compared to the area effect. Ribbed Smoked Sheet (RSS), Latex Concentrates (LC), Technically Specified Rubber (TSR), Pale Latex Crepe (PLC) and Estate Brown Crepe (EBC) are the important marketing forms of natural rubber. RSS is graded into six grades on the basis of its quality, i.e., RSS 1X, RSS 1, RSS 2, RSS 3, RSS 4 and RSS 5. Rubber marketing structure of the state consists of three separate sectors viz. individual sector, co-operative sector and corporate sector. Rubber mark, RUBCO and RPSs are the three major players in the cooperative sector and their interventions in the market reduce the influence of middlemen ensuring more return to the producers.

N2  - Supermarkets, specialized wholesalers, processors, and agro-exporters are transforming the marketing channels into which smallholder farmers sell produce in low-income economies. We develop a conceptual framework with which to study contracting between smallholders and a commodity-processing firm. We then synthesize results from empirical studies of contract farming arrangements in five countries (Ghana, India, Madagascar, Mozambique, and Nicaragua). The resulting meta-narrative documents patterns of participation, the welfare gains associated with participation, reasons for nonparticipation, the significant extent of contract noncompliance, and the considerable dynamism of these value chains as farmers and firms enter and exit frequently.

N2  - The phenomenally higher world prices of petroleum constitute adverse terms of trade shocks for Botswana. Using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of energy-economy interactions for Botswana, the effects of these price increases are analysed. The evidence shows that the oil-price perturbations cause a contraction of the economy, increase unemployment, and reduce material welfare, with the rural households losing out considerable less than urban households. Even a large oil-price shock of forty per cent decreases gross domestic product (GDP) only by 0.3 per cent. Whilst the overall economic adjustment cost is small, the impacts on some economic sectors are sizeable.

N2  - This paper investigates the dynamic impacts of cotton marketing reforms on farm output in rural Zambia. Following liberalization and the elimination of the Zambian cotton marketing board, the sector developed an outgrower scheme whereby cotton firms provided credit, access to inputs and output markets, and technical assistance to the farmers. There are two distinctive phases of the reforms: a failure of the outgrower contracts, due to farmers' debt renegation, firm hold up, and lack of coordination among firms and farms, and a subsequent period of success of the scheme, due to enhanced contract enforcement and commitment. We find interesting dynamics in the sector. During the phase of failure, farmers were pushed back into subsistence and cotton yields per hectare declined. With the improvement of the outgrower scheme, farmers devoted larger shares of land to cash crops, and farm output significantly increased.

N2  - The increasing importance of premium segments and private labels raise skepticism about the ability of Fair Trade to help smallholders compete in high value-added markets. Using panel data collected in Mali, this paper contributes to the debate by estimating the impact of Fairtrade certification on the quality of Malian cotton. Controlling for the nonrandom certification of producers, results show a significant impact on the quality of cotton produced by both certified and geographically close noncertified growers via spillover effects. The analysis suggests that contract farming enforced by third-parties and demonstration effects foster the adoption of innovative agricultural practices.

N2  - Governments, donors and NGOs have promoted environmental and social certification schemes for coffee producers as certified market channels are assumed to offer higher prices and better incomes. Additionally, it is presumed that these certifications contribute to poverty reduction of smallholders. Yet, gross margins, profits and poverty levels of certified smallholder coffee producers have not yet been quantitatively analyzed applying random sampling techniques. Our quantitative household survey of 327 randomly selected members of conventional, organic and organic-fairtrade certified cooperatives in Nicaragua is complemented by over a hundred qualitative in-depth interviews. The results show that although farm-gate prices of certified coffees are higher than of conventional coffees, the profitability of certified coffee production and its subsequent effect on poverty levels is not clear-cut. Per capita net coffee incomes are insufficient to cover basic needs of all coffee producing households. Certified producers are more often found below the absolute poverty line than conventional producers. Over a period of ten years, our analysis shows that organic and organic-fairtrade farmers have become poorer relative to conventional producers. We conclude that coffee yield levels, profitability and efficiency need to be increased, because prices for certified coffee cannot compensate for low productivity, land or labor constraints.

N2  - This study evaluated the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on the wellbeing of smallholder farmers using cross-sectional data collected from the eastern part of Ethiopia. Using consumption per adult equivalent as a wellbeing indicator, we measured the impact of agricultural cooperative membership by implementing propensity score matching and endogenous switching regression estimation techniques. Both estimation methods indicate that joining agricultural cooperatives has a positive impact on the wellbeing of smallholder farmers. Furthermore, the analysis also indicates that agricultural cooperative membership has a heterogeneous impact on wellbeing among its members.

N2  - The Kaleya Smallholders Company Limited (KASCOL) model has been considered in Zambia a success in increasing smallholders' participation, ownership and governance in an agri-food value chain. This study explores if and why this was a successful experience. The evidence gathered revealed that along its thirty years of existence, the model was able to grow the smallholder ownership and governance role. Although the context, governance structures and managerial competence were necessary factors in the sustainability of the model, the variables related to social capital were key determinants for the long term successful inclusion of the smallholders.

N2  - Purpose--Cassava production surged noticeably in Southeastern Africa beginning in the 1990s. The purpose of this paper is to examine the commercial responses and food security consequences of cassava production growth in the region. Design/methodology/approach--The paper incorporates a mix of quantitative analysis, based primarily on original analysis of national farm household survey data, together with key informant interviews with value chain participants in the three neighboring countries of Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia. Findings--In the cassava production zones, cassava's high productivity translates into per kilogram carbohydrate costs 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the cost of cereals such as maize and wheat, thereby opening up a range of profitable opportunities for commercialization of cassava-based foods, feeds and industrial products. Despite this potential, cassava commercialization in Southeastern Africa remains in its formative stages, with only 10 per cent to 30 per cent of production currently marketed. Unlike West Africa, where cassava commercialization has centered on marketing prepared cassava-based convenience foods, the emerging cassava markets in Southeastern Africa have centered on fresh cassava, low value-added cassava flour, and experiments in industrial processing of cassava-based starches, biofuels, and feeds. Strategic investment in a set of key public goods (breeding, training in food sciences and food safety, and research on in-ground cassava storage) can help to shape this transition in ways that benefit both commercial interests and the food security of vulnerable households. Originality/value--The paper compares cassava commercialization across differing agro-climatic zones, policy environments, and food staple zones.

N2  - Agricultural producer cooperatives are of great significance to the development of agricultural productivity and can provide improved economic welfare benefits to farmers. However, such organizations have not been well-developed in China. While China's new Cooperatives Law of 2007 has generated interest among scholars, very few empirical analyses have focused on the role of cooperatives in China's agricultural sector. The main objective of this study is to investigate the determinants of farmers' perception and their decision to participate in cooperatives, using a unique dataset from recently collected survey data of farming households in China's Jilin Province. The empirical results from probit and logit regression models suggest that educational attainment, risk comfort level, farm expansion, operational costs, geographic location and crop types are significant factors that influence producers' perception of cooperatives, as well as their participation behavior.

N2  - Producer companies can help smallholder farmers participate in emerging high-value markets, such as the export market and the unfolding modern retail sector in India. As elsewhere in the developing world, in India, small farmers' livelihoods are being threatened due to the liberalization and privatization of Indian agriculture and the increasing interest of private capital in the agribusiness sector. The withdrawal of the state from productive and economic functions, and changes in the organization of marketing channels, present new challenges for small-scale farmers. In this environment of greater instability and competition, organization and collective action can help to enhance farmers' competitiveness and increase their advantage in emerging market opportunities. We build on the ideas of value-chain governance and collective-action literature and introduce the functions and organizational structure of producer companies in India within this context. On the basis of a case study of a specific producer company in Maharashtra, which produces and markets mango and cashew nuts, we discuss the potential benefits for rural communities and the reempowering effect of this form of farmer organization.

N2  - It is widely recognized that mineral fertilizers must play an important part in improving agricultural productivity in western Kenyan farming systems. This paper suggests that for this goal to be realized, farmers' knowledge must be strengthened to improve their understanding of fertilizers and their use. We analyzed smallholder knowledge of fertilizers and nutrient management, and draw practical lessons from empirical collective fertilizer-response experiments. Data were gathered from the collective fertilizer-response trials, through focus group discussions, by participant observation, and via in-depth interviews representing 40 households. The collective trials showed that the application of nitrogen (N) or phosphorous (P) alone was insufficient to enhance yields in the study area. The response to P on the trial plots was mainly influenced by incidences of the parasitic Striga weed, by spatial variability or gradients in soil fertility of the experimental plots, and by interactions with N levels. These results inspired farmer to design and conduct experiments to compare crop performance with and without fertilizer, and between types of fertilizers, or responses on different soils. Participating farmers were able to differentiate types of fertilizer, and understood rates of application and the roles of respective fertilizers in nutrient supply. However, notions were broadly generated by unsteady yield responses when fertilizers were used across different fertility gradients, association with high cost (especially if recommended rates were to be applied), association of fertilizer use with hybrids and certain crops, historical factors, among other main aspects. We identified that strengthening fertilizer knowledge must be tailored within existing, albeit imperfect, systems of crop and animal husbandry. Farmers' perceptions cannot be changed by promoting more fertilizer use alone, but may require a more basic approach that, for example, encourages farmer experimentation and practices to enhance soil properties such as carbon build-up in impoverished local soils.

N2  - High-value export supply chains hold potential to improve smallholders' welfare, but their relative production inefficiency and moral hazard problems can cause exporters to prefer vertically integrated plantation production. However, pineapple exporters in Ghana produce both for their own account and purchase from smallholders. We hypothesize that vertical integration is only partial because exporters face large market risks that smallholders, surprisingly, are better able to absorb. We show empirically that exporters' average rejection rate of export-quality fruit is high and varies in response to unanticipated fluctuations in European demand. These results support the hypothesis and are consistent with theories of partial vertical integration but not the standard principal-agent paradigm.

N2  - There is no consensus about how globalisation--trade and foreign investments--affects poverty reduction. Using household survey data, this study contributes to the empirical literature on globalisation and poverty by analysing the household-level implications of increased foreign investments and trade in the horticulture sector in Senegal. In many aspects this represents what many would consider a 'worst-case scenario'. Stringent rich country standards are imposed on exports and the supply chain is controlled by a single multinational company with extreme levels of supply base consolidation and vertical integration and complete exclusion of smallholder suppliers. We analyse and quantify income and poverty effects under these 'worst-case conditions' and find significant positive welfare impacts through employment creation and labour market participation.

N2  - Small-scale producers in emerging markets have a particularly difficult time accessing the same marketing channels which are available to their larger counterparts. Cooperatives are an oft-recommended solution, allowing members to collectively mimic the advantages of larger producers. In this study, we explore whether or not cooperatives in Mexico demonstrate these expectations. Using depth interviews of seven farm and non-farm rural cooperatives, we find that participation in export channels is extremely limited and that the patterns of market access can be explained in part by differences in vision, quality of leadership, and cultural influences. Leaders are also generally underprepared for the business environment which they attempt to access, suggesting that educational initiatives which build business capacity be developed. Foreign buyers attempting to work with cooperatives (and possibly other small businesses) in emerging markets ought to account for the different foundations and expectations of their transaction partners.

N2  - Based on three case studies in China and Brazil, this paper explores the terms of access for farmers' participation in certified organic agriculture (OA) and investigates the influence of adoption on productivity, nutrient budgets, income and labour use. Small-scale farmers converting to OA require substantial external production-related, marketing and certification support. Access to OA was strongly dependent upon the type of support available to farmers. Organization based on a contract-farming model resulted in OA only being an option available to a narrow group of farmers, whilst OA initiated by a farmer cooperative provided better access. Gross output was significantly higher for oranges, whilst for the other crops gross output was similar. However, organic farmers in China felt that adoption had improved prices, incomes and market access. Farmers' perception of improved incomes is probably due to improved market access coupled with either a large production base, production intensification and production diversification. This study demonstrates that organization of farmers, and the manner in which this is structured, is crucial for external support to have an effect. Thus, OA may be a development path for small farmers if the supporting structures are provided at a small financial interest rate.

N2  - In Nicaragua and elsewhere in Central America, small-scale farmers are weighing the risks of entering into contracts with supermarket chains. We use unique data from cooperatives supplying supermarkets to study the effect of supply agreements on producers' mean output prices and price stability. We find that prices paid by the domestic retail chain approximate the traditional market in mean and variance while mean prices paid by Walmart are significantly lower than the traditional market. However, the Walmart contract is found to systematically reduce price volatility. We find some evidence, however, that farmers may be paying too much for this contractual insurance against price variation.

N2  - Rural households in the semiarid Northern Ethiopian highlands are net buyers of food. Crop failure due to erratic and unpredictable rainfall occurs frequently and leads to food shortages and income shocks. The renting out of land may be one of the coping responses of households exposed to shocks. We developed a theoretical household model for poor landlord households capturing their contract choice response to downside production shocks. We tested econometrically whether contract choice may depend on poverty, capital constraints, production risk and random shocks. The multinomial logit model estimates show that poor households experiencing random shocks are more likely to choose fixed-rent contracts as a distress response to shocks, suggesting that fixed-rent contracts may be used to meet immediate needs, but at the expense of future incomes. We also found that fixed-rent contracts are preferred when ex ante production risk is low, while sharecropping is more likely where production risk is high. Finally, we found an indication that the choice of a fixed-rent contract as a coping response to shocks comes as a last resort after all other means of coping are exhausted.

N2  - Most studies of tenurial insecurity focus on its effects on investment. This paper studies the hitherto unexplored relationship between tenurial insecurity and land tenancy contracts. Based on distinct features of formal law and customary rights in Madagascar, this paper augments the canonical model of sharecropping by making the strength of the landlord's property right increasing in the amount of risk she bears within the contract. Using data on landlords' subjective perceptions in rural Madagascar, empirical tests support the hypothesis that insecure property rights drive contract choice but offer little support in favor of the canonical risk sharing hypothesis.

N2  - We explore three trends in rural southern Mexico (Fair Trade coffee, migration, and conditional cash transfers) that could explain the rapid rise in education from 1995-2005 using survey data from 845 coffee farming households in Oaxaca and Chiapas, Mexico. Results from a household fixed-effects model show that household participation in a Fair Trade-organic cooperative contributed to about a 0.7 year increase in schooling for girls. US migration opportunities appear to have even stronger positive impacts on schooling for females. Although participation in Fair Trade-organic cooperatives appears also to have increased male schooling, increased migration opportunities have had an indeterminate effect for males.

N2  - Cottonseed is an aspirational crop for smallholders newly incorporated in the global cottonseed commodity chain as own-account cultivators in South India. The labor to produce cottonseeds, which are hybrids, in the field is excessive. Multinational and Indian corporations depend on hybridization to protect their intellectual property rights in branded seeds. As wage rates rise and seed prices do not, the outsourcing of cottonseed production to smallholders is attractive to capital. It is mostly the unpaid, family labor of smallholders which now generates exchange value. While smallholders dream of spectacular gains and some success stories seem to support this, growing cottonseed is a risky business and, at times, the returns to smallholders are so low that the very costs of reproducing family labor are unmet; many go into debt. Yet, smallholders from a formerly untouchable caste, or Dalit, community, who just a short while ago worked as 'cottonseed children' for rich farmers are, for the first time, proudly growing cottonseed on 'their own plots of land' and 'laboring for themselves'. To explain this paradox I propose a vernacular calculus of the economic, a noneconomistic grid, for understanding why Dalit smallholders continue this form of production even when they could earn more from wage labor. I argue that the rearticulation of caste in terms of dignity and perceptions of autonomy shape this calculus. I argue further that Dalit smallholders experience the inherent contradictions of capitalism through a 'structure of feeling' marked by perplexity. At a time when smallholder contract farming is being suggested as a new development strategy by the World Bank and questioned by its detractors, a vernacular calculus of the economic and affective experiences marked by perplexity may be more widely relevant as generalized characteristics of smallholder capitalism.

N2  - We explore the distributional effects of lowering transaction costs to allow access to improved market opportunities for small farmers in the Peruvian Highlands. We find that when new marketing opportunities arise, those that have more land, are better educated and are well organized are able to deal with the complexities that the new contractual arrangements entail. Although this on average implies an increase in net income for small farmers, it also affects the distribution of earnings, generating a more polarized small farmer economy. To counteract this effect and reduce inequality in the opportunities of less endowed small farmers, complementary policies need to be put in place.

N2  - This paper assesses the implications of large-scale investments in biofuels for growth and income distribution. We find that biofuels investment enhances growth and poverty reduction despite some displacement of food crops by biofuels. Overall, the biofuel investment trajectory analyzed increases Mozambique's annual economic growth by 0.6 percentage points and reduces the incidence of poverty by about 6 percentage points over a 12-year phase-in period. Benefits depend on production technology. An outgrower approach to producing biofuels is more pro-poor, due to the greater use of unskilled labor and accrual of land rents to smallholders, compared with the more capital-intensive plantation approach. Moreover, the benefits of outgrower schemes are enhanced if they result in technology spillovers to other crops. These results should not be taken as a green light for unrestrained biofuels development. Rather, they indicate that a carefully designed and managed biofuels policy holds the potential for substantial gains.

N2  - This paper investigates the function of various modes of wage payment, focusing on the role of in-kind wages in enhancing household food security in developing countries. It first demonstrates the importance of in-kind wage payment in the initial phase of economic development through compiling historical records from Asian countries including pre-war Japan and colonial India. This section is followed by a survey of theoretical explanations of in-kind wages. As a relatively unexplored explanation, this paper then develops a theoretical model of labor supply to different labor contracts, incorporating considerations of food security as the main explanation for in-kind wages. The theoretical model predicts that when food security considerations are important for workers, possibly due to poverty and underdeveloped food markets, they work more under a contract with wages paid in kind (food) than under a contract with wages paid in cash. This prediction is supported by empirical evidence from rural Myanmar. Estimation results of the reduced-form determinants of labor supply show that workers supply more labor to a job whose wages are paid in kind when the share of staple food in workers' budget is higher and the farmland on which they produce food themselves is smaller.

N2  - In Ethiopia, agricultural cooperatives are expected to play a key role in linking smallholder farmers to the recently established commodity exchange system. Recent research has found, however, that the commercialisation levels of cooperative members do not differ significantly from those of non-member farmers in Ethiopia. We argue though that the impact of cooperative membership on commercialisation may vary significantly depending on the type of cooperative organisations considered. Applying propensity score matching as well as regression analysis to a set of farm household living in rural areas where the commodity exchange system was to become operational, we consistently find significantly higher commercialisation rates, when compared with non-member farmers, for farmers belonging to marketing cooperatives. Livelihood cooperatives, on the other hand, appear to have insignificant or negative impact on Ethiopian farmers' commercialisation. We conclude that the selective inclusion of marketing cooperatives in the commodity exchange system has the potential to simultaneously reduce the rural poverty and maximise agro-commodity commercialisation in Ethiopia.

N2  - This paper focuses on contract design to improve the incentive structure of current coordination mechanisms related to sustainable land use management in the Ethiopian highlands. The main objective is to assess whether, and if so under which terms and conditions, rural households are willing to enter into contractual agreements to invest in soil conservation measures on their land. Participation constraints are tested under different soil erosion and institutional-economic conditions in a choice experiment targeting 750 rural households. We show that contracts provided by local government peasant associations offering additional credit, land use security, and extension services could be an effective means to increase the share of farmers implementing soil conservation measures. However, trust in contract terms and conditions appears to play an important role. Farmers living in the most erosion prone areas are most likely to participate, while farmers taking soil conservation measures already are less likely to enter into a contractual agreement with the local government. Farmers not taking soil conservation measures will only do so if the contract price is lower than or equal to the income losses suffered from soil erosion.

N2  - Rural cooperative finance, targeting small farmers, is one of the three pillars of rural finance in China. Historically, its development has taken three forms of organization: rural credit union, rural cooperative fund, and mutual fund. Because of changes in market and policies' environment, but especially of the abandonment of cooperative principles, the credit union has become a commercial financial institution and cooperative fund disappeared. The current practices of mutual aid funds are paving the way for the future development of the rural cooperative finance relying on the integration of financial and economic cooperatives.

N2  - This paper estimates the determinants of farmers' decisions to join a rural producer organisation, the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi (NASFAM), in Kasungu District. Data for the study were collected in June and August 2003 using household-level questionnaires and stratified random sampling, where strata were membership status and gender. Probit analysis of 250 farmers shows that off-farm sources of income, distance of the farmer's household from Kasungu District centre, age of the farmer, tobacco farming, education, household level land holding, and gender determined the decision to join NASFAM. These results suggest that farmers should be informed of the potential benefits of participating in rural development efforts, and that rural communication and information infrastructure should be improved so as to reduce the costs of information access and transactions in general, if participation in organisations such as NASFAM is to be enhanced.

T1  - The Role of Social Distance in Sharecropping Efficiency: The Case of Two Rice-Growing Villages in Nepal

N2  - The purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding of the role of culture in general, and social distance in particular, in influencing the choice and efficiency of various contractual modes in developing country agriculture. It aims to focus on sharecropping, but the model of social distance can be applied to any contract, mainly those in close-knit village societies. Principal components analysis (PCA) is used in the study to develop a social distance index for all sharecroppers, which is included as an independent variable in land productivity ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. Findings indicate social distance is a key determinant in sharecropping efficiency for marginal tenant farmers in rural Nepal. Specifically, social distance is found to be a significant factor in explaining land productivity differentials between owned land and sharecropped land. Future research hopes to see whether social distance is also a significant factor in the efficiency and choice of bonded labor contracts. It intends to use simple OLS regressions for sharecroppers and bonded laborers separately in which: input use and land productivity are separate dependent variables, and the various factors or proxies of social distance are independent variables to test for their particular impact; each type of contract is the dependent variable to see the extent to which social distance affects the choice of tenancy; and social distance is the dependent variable so one can see the specific impact of different proxies. Given the small sample (although representative), the strong results in this paper are limited. From a policy standpoint, the results suggest that a relatively egalitarian agrarian structure, insofar as it results in lower social distances among parties to land and labor contracts, would have a positive impact on productivity. Therefore, the object of agrarian reforms should not be to alter or constrain the form of contracts (for example by banning sharecropping) but rather to improve the social relations among contracting parties. This paper is original and provides value in three ways: a conceptually and theoretically innovative model that explains sharecropping efficiency independent of standard explanations of market imperfections, transaction costs, and risk; in developing a new measure of social distance that allows the data to determine the weights of the independent variables in constructing social distance; and to see the need to more importantly study the changing social relations on which contracts are based and are often only one element of.

N2  - In this special issue, we present seven studies that collectively attempt to investigate the role of non-farm income in long-term and short-term poverty reduction in Asia and Africa. The first four studies out of the seven use long-term panel data over two decades in the Philippines, Thailand, Bangladesh, and India. These studies show drastic increases in non-farm income shares and corresponding declines in poverty levels over time, especially in the Philippines and Thailand. Education levels of household members and returns to education also increased significantly in these countries. The remaining three studies use cross-sectional and short-term panel data from Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda. These African studies show high proportions of poor households and low shares of non-farm income that are somewhat comparable to the situation in the 1980s described in the Asian studies. Without the Green Revolution that provided stable farm income and potential financial resources to invest in children' education in Asia, it is not clear if African farm households can follow the Asian examples.

N2  - To measure the incidence and severity of health payment-induced poverty of rural households under the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) in rural Shandong, China. We collected primary data from a household survey to identify catastrophic health payments and measure associated health payment-induced poverty in a county of Shandong province. From a stratified random cluster sample of 3,101 households, 375 households that might be at risk of catastrophic payments were identified and interviewed. A validity test of the screening method was conducted, from which we obtained the adjusted total number of households with catastrophic payments in the sample of 3101. The health payment-induced poverty incidence and severity were compared without and with NCMS reimbursements. Before the NCMS intervention, 5.06% of the sample households fell below the national poverty line due to health payments in 2004, compared with 4.03% after reimbursements. With NCMS reimbursements, the health payment-induced poverty gap of those households still remaining below the Chinese national poverty line dropped by 19.2% to an average of 977.2 Yuan. Out-of-pocket health payments remain a severe burden for rural households. Financial protection from the NCMS was limited.

N2  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate contract farming in China, using vegetable production as a case. Specifically, the authors analyze farmers' contract decisions for different types of contracts, their contract compliance behaviors, and their profitability affected by the contracts both analytically and empirically. The authors assume growers with alternative risk preferences make the contract decisions to maximize their expected utilities, under exogenous market price risks and contract terms determined by the processor or wholesaler. Both fixed price and floating price contracts are analyzed. Two surveys of 185 and 85 farm households, respectively, are obtained in Shandong province in 2010, and econometric analyses with both Logit and least square regressions are conducted. The results indicate that the determining factors for contract farming are related to farmers' risk attitude, gender, yield, farm size, and labor availability. However, contrary to the common belief that contracts are a risk management tool for risk averse farmers, the risk lovers tend to use contract farming instead of risk averters. Female household heads and farms with more labors tend not to use contracts, but larger farms with more acreage are more likely to contract. These suggest Chinese farmers' primary motivation of contracting is not market price risk management, but rather seeking better offers and marketing transaction cost reduction.

N2  - Index insurance, which indemnifies agricultural producers based on an objectively observable variable that is highly correlated with production losses but which cannot be influenced by the producer, can provide adequate protection against catastrophic droughts without suffering from the moral hazard and adverse selection problems that typically cause conventional agricultural insurance programmes to fail. Using historical maize and cotton yield data from nine districts in Zimbabwe, we find that catastrophic drought insurance contracts based on the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be constructed whose indemnities exhibit higher correlations with yield losses than the conventional rainfall index. In addition the NDVI contracts can be offered within the 5 to 10 per cent premium range considered reasonably affordable to many poor smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe.

N2  - This paper examines the notion of inclusiveness in rural producer organizations (RPOs) and the extent to which such RPOs can be used to reach the rural poor in sub-Saharan Africa. Using farmer cooperatives in Ethiopia as a case in point, the paper examines the role of RPOs in supporting smallholder commercialization, and the extent to which principles of an inclusive, bottom-up approach relate to their marketing performance. Based on a combination of nationally-representative household- and cooperative-level survey data, we find that poorer farmers tend not to participate in these organizations although they may indirectly benefit from them. When they do participate, they are often excluded from decision-making processes. Finally, we investigate the relationship between marketing performance and inclusiveness and uncover evidence of significant tradeoffs between them.

N2  - Morocco's argan oil is now the most expensive edible oil in the world. High-value argan markets have sparked a bonanza of argan activity. Nongovernmental organizations, international and domestic development agencies, and argan oil cooperatives aggressively promote the win-win aim of simultaneously benefiting local people and the health of the argan forest. This paper tests some of these win-win claims. Analysis of a panel of detailed household data suggests that the boom has enabled some rural households to increase consumption, increase their goat herds (which bodes poorly for the argan forest), and send their girls to secondary school. The boom has predictably made households vigilant guardians of fruit on the tree, but it has not incited investments in longer term tree and forest health. We evaluate landscape-level impacts of these changes using commune-level data on educational enrollment and normalized difference vegetation index data over the period from 1981 to 2009. The results of the mesoanalysis of enrollment are consistent with the microanalysis: the argan boom seems to have improved educational outcomes, especially for girls. Our normalized difference vegetation index analysis, however, suggests that booming argan prices have not improved the forest and may have even induced degradation. We conclude by exploring the dynamic interactions between argan markets, local institutions, rural household welfare, and forest conservation and sustainability.

N2  - Vulnerability can combine inequality with the volatility of household consumption to reflect a household's welfare level. Based on utility theory, this paper discusses the definition of vulnerability and decomposes it to investigate inequality and volatility in household consumption. We use CFPS data to analyze household vulnerability in rural China. The results show that the majority of rural households are vulnerable, and compared with inter-village inequality, intra-village inequality is the main source of vulnerability. We also find that increasing rural household income is the most effective method to decrease its vulnerability. Enhancing the average educational level of household labors can effectively reduce vulnerability, but expenditure on higher education can significantly increase it. The new rural cooperative medical system and social insurance are capable of decreasing it to a large extent. Social capital, family size and a higher labor force ratio are conductive to decreasing vulnerability, which can effectively explain why households in rural China tend to be big ones, and frequent ceremonial activities among relatives and friends.

N2  - Contract farming is emerging as an important form of vertical coordination in India, and its economic and social consequences are attracting considerable attention in the agri-food policy debates. In this paper, we have examined issues of efficiency and equity in contract farming of milk and arrive at the following conclusions. First, contract farming is more profitable than independent production mainly because of its potential to reduce marketing and transaction costs. Second, small-scale producers face higher marketing and transaction costs, and they derive significant benefits from participation in contract farming. Third, we do not find any difference in price realization by contract and independent producers, hence no extraction of monopsonistic rent by the firm.

N2  - This article examines the impact of marketing cooperatives on smallholder commercialization of cereals using detailed household data in rural Ethiopia. We use the strong government role in promoting the establishment of cooperatives to justify the use of propensity score matching to compare households that are cooperative members to similar households in comparable areas without cooperatives. The analysis reveals that although cooperatives obtain higher prices for their members, they are not associated with a significant increase in the overall share of cereal production sold commercially by their members. However, these average results hide considerable heterogeneity across households. In particular, we find that smaller farmers tend to reduce their marketed output as a result of higher prices, whereas the opposite is true for larger farmers.

N2  - This study compares contract and non-contract growers of apples and green onions in Shandong Province, China in order to explore the constraints on participation and the impact of contract farming on income. We find little evidence that firms prefer to work with larger farms, though all farms in the area are quite small. Using a Heckman selection-correction model, we find that contract farming raises income even after controlling for observable and unobservable household characteristics. These results suggest that contract farming can help raise small-farm income, though questions remain regarding the number of farmers that can be brought into such schemes.

N2  - This paper seeks to use data from China between 1929 and 1933 and provides new empirical evidence to the debate over the impact of land ownership and land-renting systems on agricultural productivity. The authors estimate the OLS regression to determine the relationship between land ownership (and land-renting systems) and farmers' productivity. The findings suggest that land ownership was not a major factor in determining farmers' productivity; instead, agricultural infrastructures and institutions had the greatest influence on agricultural productivity. Furthermore, different renting systems generated different impacts on farmers' behavior: sharecropping reduced farmers' productivity while fixed rental contracts had no significant impact on farmers' productivity.

N2  - This paper examines the factors influencing the accessibility of microcredit by rural households in China. The empirical analysis utilises logistic regression, with data collected through a household survey carried out in one province in China. A total of twelve household-level factors are identified as determinants in households' access to microcredit, including educational level, household size, income, among others. In addition to these, results indicate that rural households' accessibility to microcredit can also be impaired by the supply-side factors (e.g., interest rates, loan processing time). The empirical analysis establishes a positive relationship between households' credit demand and access to credit. The paper thus concludes that households should be encouraged to raise capital requirements (for example, create investment opportunities in on/off farm activities) to increase their demand for credit, which can enhance their access to microcredit. In addition, microcredit institutions (such as the Rural Credit Cooperatives) should improve their lending schemes and micro loan products to better suit the diversified needs of the rural population.

N2  - This study explores the implications of supermarket expansion in the developing world for actors, particularly small-scale farmers, along the supply chains, by examining a case from Thailand. Supermarkets exert monopsonistic power by pushing a range of processing and marketing costs on to suppliers and instituting a short-term tendering process among suppliers. The scale of the farming operation is not a barrier to entering the chain, but important financial and social capital investments are necessary. Returns compared to traditional farming can be high, and appear sustainable at least in the medium term.

N2  - A bivariate probit model was employed to jointly and separately estimate banana market participation decisions of buying and selling households in Rwanda and Burundi using household survey data. Selectivity bias was corrected for estimating the transacted volumes using Heckman's procedure. The results showed that transaction cost-related factors such as geographical location of households, market information sources, and travel time to the nearest urban center influence market participation. Non-price-related factors such as security of land tenure, labor availability, off-farm income, gender of the household head, and years of farming experience had a significant influence on the transacted volumes. Output prices had a significant correlation with sales volume, indicating price incentives increased supply by sellers. Generally, the findings suggest that policies aimed at investments in rural road infrastructure, market information systems, collective marketing, and value addition of banana products may provide a potential avenue for mitigating transaction costs and enhancing market participation and production of marketed surplus by rural households.

N2  - This paper explores the potential impacts of payments for agricultural soil carbon sequestration on poverty of farm households and on the sustainability of agricultural systems, using economic theory combined with evidence from three case studies in Kenya, Peru, and Senegal. The case studies indicate that the likely impact of carbon contracts will be to raise rural incomes and reduce the rate of soil carbon loss. In some cases, carbon contracts may be able to stabilize soil carbon stocks at a higher level than would otherwise be economically feasible. These findings suggest that carbon payments could have a positive impact on the sustainability of production systems while also reducing poverty. The analysis indicates that payments for environmental services are most likely to have a positive impact when they are implemented in an enabling economic and institutional environment.

N2  - Sharecropping between poor landlords and rich tenants has hitherto been the subject of very little academic scrutiny. Given that such 'reverse share tenancy' contracts are mostly at odds with the canonical risk-sharing explanation for sharecropping, this article discusses a rationale for them that relies on weak property rights as well as the legal doctrine of adverse possession, and tests it using data from Lac Alaotra, Madagascar, where this type of tenancy accounts for one-third of land rentals. The empirical findings are discussed in relation to recent land-reform policies by the Government of Madagascar, the World Bank, IFAD, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation.

N2  - Global retail companies ("supermarkets") have an increasing influence on developing countries, through foreign investments and/or through the imposition of their private standards. The impact on developing countries and poverty is often assessed as negative. In this paper, we show the opposite, based on an analysis of primary data collected to measure the impact of supermarkets on small contract farmers in Madagascar, one of the poorest countries in the world. Almost 10,000 farmers in the Highlands of Madagascar produce vegetables for supermarkets in Europe. In this global supply chain, small farmers' micro-contracts are combined with intensive farm assistance and supervision programs to fulfill complex quality requirements and phyto-sanitary standards of supermarkets. Small farmers that participate in these contracts have higher welfare, more income stability and shorter lean periods. We also find significant effects on improved technology adoption, better resource management and spillovers on the productivity of the staple crop rice. The small but emerging modern retail sector in Madagascar does not (yet) deliver these benefits as they do not (yet) request the same high standards for their supplies.

N2  - In the debate on trade and poverty, it is argued that standards act as trade barriers and cause marginalization of the poor. This paper quantifies income and poverty effects of high-standards trade and integrates labor market effects, by using company and household survey data from the vegetable export chain in Senegal. We find that exports grew sharply despite increasing standards, contributing importantly to rural incomes and poverty reduction. Tightening standards induced a shift from smallholder contract farming to integrated estate production, altering the mechanism through which poor households benefit: through labor markets instead of product markets.

N2  - In Turkey, the Wholesale Markets Law was enacted in 1995 to facilitate small-scale growers' access to the fresh produce market. Cooperatives and commission agents have thus become the main marketing structures available to small-scale fresh produce growers, to supply supermarkets and comply with their new requirements. In this paper, we question the advantages and disadvantages that confront small farmers with respect to those marketing structures to allow for market matching or quality upgrading. Drawing on ownership and transaction cost arguments, we use an analytical framework to identify and compare the costs of these marketing organizations. Based on data collected through a large number of interviews with stakeholders, we show that commission agents and credit cooperatives tend to be more efficient than traditional cooperatives as regards sales performance and decision costs. However, the lack of apparent competition between commission agents does not allow for sufficient provision of incentives for producers to invest in high-quality production. Consequently, credit cooperatives are the only structure progressively turning to strategies of quality upgrading and supermarket supply. The flipside of such strategies is that they may lead to the marginalization of small-scale farmers.

N2  - Morocco's argan oil is now the most expensive edible oil in the world. Growing high-value argan markets have sparked a bonanza of argan activity. NGOs, international and domestic development agencies, and argan oil cooperatives have promoted the win-win aim of simultaneously benefiting locals and the argan forest. We test this win-win claim by surveying households before and after rapid appreciation in argan prices. The argan boom has benefited some rural households. Those well positioned to benefit increased their goat herds more than other households, which bodes poorly for forest impacts, and were more likely to send their girls to secondary school. While locals are keeping their goats out of argan trees during the harvest, they may also be resorting to more aggressive harvesting techniques. The boom has made households vigilant guardians of fruit on their own trees, but has not incited investments in longer term tree and forest health.

N2  - The paper discusses India's agrarian crisis and the role of corporate-led contract farming in addressing these crisis. A two-stage Heckman model was used to explain determinants of participation in contract farming, and whether participation in contract farming affects farm income. The results indicate that contract farming has a positive impact on crop productivity and farm income. The socio-economic factors that influenced participation in contract farming were education, age, farm size, access to institutional credit, source of off-farm income and membership to an organization. Factors related to the likelihood of participation in contract farming slightly differed from the factors affecting farm income.

N2  - Objective: To measure the impact of China's New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) on catastrophic medical payments of rural households in Linyi County, Shandong Province. Method: In 2005, from a stratified cluster sample of 3101 rural households, we identified 375 households that might be at risk of catastrophic payments by searching through NCMS claims and interviewing key informants. We interviewed these 375 households and confirmed that 231 had had catastrophic payments (>=40% of the households' capacity to pay; CTP) during 2004. A validity test of our screening method found another eight cases among immediate neighbours of these 375 households; by extrapolation, we obtained an adjusted total of 289 catastrophic households in the sample of 3101. We measured the impact of the NCMS on hardship alleviation by counterfactual analysis, comparing catastrophic payments before and after NCMS reimbursements. Result: The effect was twofold. Before NCMS intervention 8.98% of Linyi population had had catastrophic out-of-pocket payments compared with 8.25% after reimbursements. Catastrophic severity for households remaining in catastrophe after reimbursement dropped by 18.7% to an average of 6.34 times the household's CTP. Conclusion: Out-of-pocket medical payments remain a burden for rural households. Financial protection from the NCMS, with an average reimbursement of 17.8%, was modest and should be restructured to provide better benefits that are targeted to those in most need.

N2  - In the absence of a market for weather derivatives in India, the paper discusses a hypothetical market, and how a contract could be structured when weather derivative trading is introduced. A survey was conducted in six villages in two districts in the state of Rajasthan in order to assess the inclination of small farmers to use weather derivatives to hedge yield risk and to determine their willingness to pay. The findings of the amount that the farmers would be willing to pay are used in this paper. The need of the hour is to have a simple method for determining the price of an option on a rainfall index, so that a possible contract is feasible both for the seller as well as for the buyer. This is brought out in the paper using the case of soyabean growers in Jhalawar district.

N2  - This study aims to examine the extent to which certain characteristics and asset endowments of smallholder farmer groups facilitate collective action initiatives to improve group marketing performance. This is approached through an evaluation of a government-led programme in Tanzania, which is attempting to increase smallholder farmers' incomes and food security through a market-oriented intervention. Findings suggest that more mature groups with strong internal institutions, functioning group activities, and a good asset base of natural capital are more likely to improve their market situation. Gender composition of groups also affects group marketing performance, as an enabling factor for male-dominated groups. Structural social capital in the form of membership in other groups and ties to external service providers, and cognitive social capital in the form of intra-group trust and altruistic behaviour are not significant factors in a group's ability to improve its market situation.

N2  - Consumer concerns over the environmental and social conditions of coffee production have led to the proliferation of sustainability codes, certification schemes, and labeling claims in the sector. This paper addresses how the global private regulation of ethical and environmental standards is having several implications for value chain structures and institutions in the smallholder coffee systems of Indonesia. Global private regulation is driving structural changes in modes of farmer organization, trader-farmer relationships, and is resulting in the increased upstream penetration of multinational trading companies into coffee-producing areas across Indonesia. An unintended consequence of these changes in the future may be to increase transaction costs along the value chain and to exert an overall downward pressure on farm-gate prices.

N2  - Concerned about national grain self-sufficiency and rural household incomes, in 2004 China announced that it was planning to reverse its longstanding policy of taxing farm households and instead began to provide them with subsidies. Over the past five years, annual announcements have trumpeted rises in subsidies. Surprisingly, despite the historic turnaround of policy and the likely implication of this subsidy policy to China's grain economy, there has been no household-level survey-based research that has sought to understand the effect of China's subsidy programme on household behaviour. Using data from a national survey of more than 1000 households, we examine in detail a number of different dimensions of the subsidy programme. According to the survey-based findings, we have shown that although agricultural subsidies per farm are low, on per unit of cultivated area basis or total amount of budget, the subsidies are high. Almost all producers are receiving them. Subsidies are mostly being given to the land contractor, not the tiller. Most importantly, the subsidies appear to be nondistorting. No matter if we look at descriptive statistics in tables, scatter plots or regression analyses, there is no evidence that grain subsidies are distorting producer decisions in terms of grain area or input use decisions.

N2  - In the absence of formal insurance services, smallholder farmers are devoid of effective ways of managing numerous risks they encounter in their daily lives. One response mechanisms common among rural households is reliance on network-based collective action arrangement driven by motives of reciprocity and altruism. The indigenous financial institutions constitute a striking example of risk-sharing and risk-pooling arrangements widely practiced by the bulk of rural communities in Africa. Of these arrangements, the Ethiopian iddir can be considered as a unique and viable institution worth investigation to understand its nature and logic. Drawing on the synthesis of the available literature and household surveys, this study attempts to explain the essence and dynamism of iddir; describe its risk-pooling and risk-sharing mechanisms; investigate the principles and rules underlying its procedures and operations. It also assesses its rules using an analytical framework known as the "institutional analysis and development framework". This study can contribute to the debate concerning the logic and potential of informal institutions in, partially, meeting the insurance needs of smallholder farmers. It is important to understand and promote the mechanisms by which indigenous arrangements attempt to bridge the gap left by the formal sector.

N2  - Uganda's rapid urbanization offers new market opportunities for smallholder farmers to supply higher value markets such as supermarket chains and fast-food restaurants. Supplying these formal outlets offers higher incomes but accessing and maintaining links to these markets requires significant upgrading in terms of product quality and business management. To meet these conditions farmers need to become more organized which requires increased levels of social capital, to strengthen internal and external relations with group members, service providers and market chain actors. One farmers' group in south-western Uganda has successfully sustained sales of potatoes to a fast-food outlet in Kampala. Farmers had to learn a series of new skills and integrate multiple technical, organizational, financial and marketing innovations. This paper outlines how collective action combined with strong leadership and an iterative market-led learning process enabled a smallholder farmers' association to meet the considerable challenges of achieving the stringent quality parameters of a modern food outlet.

N2  - Using data from 587 marginalized cooperative member households in rural Mexico, this paper examines how household formal financial savings fluctuates with economic shocks and other relevant variables. Regression results show that negative shocks, income, wealth, formal credit, distance from a bank branch, percent of non-working members in a household, and education have a significant influence on formal financial savings. Results from quantile regression show that the impact of negative shocks on formal savings is only statistically significant in households with a high propensity to save. These precautionary savings households not only save more, but are inclined to withdraw savings to alleviate potentially adverse personal income trends associated with the shocks.

N2  - In spite of being the second largest horticultural producer in the world, India is a failed exporter mainly because of the inability to meet the food safety standards. Hence, successes in horticultural exports are rare. Here, we study one unique success story, Mahagrapes, a marketing partner to farmer cooperatives attributing its success to a combination of collective action and public private partnerships. Our results indicate that Mahagrapes farmers earn significantly higher income vis-a-vis their outside marketing option and smallholders face no bias in selection. Together with the farmer's ability to consistently meet standards, this implies that the model can be scaled up.

N2  - Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) forest projects are perceived as an attractive way to both help mitigate climate change and transfer income to rural poor. However, to engender participation of small-scale producers, a CDM forest project must offer sufficient incentives, while minimizing their costs of participation, all the while respecting the need for additionality. Property rights, social capital and contractual rules are critical in the success of CDM forest projects. In this paper, we ask what factors affect participation in the world's first CDM project, established in Guangxi Province, China. Using village-level surveys, we find that although the project facilitates participation through carbon pooling and a share-holding system, much of the project land remains unforested. We find that the primary reasons for the unforested regions are constrained contractual rules, property rights allocation disputes and low levels of social capital in some villages.

N2  - This paper explores the impact of agricultural price policy on poverty in West Africa, a region in which prices are an important tool for raising rural household incomes. A game-theoretic, collective model of household income generation and resource allocation is developed that incorporates three features typical of West African rural households: preference heterogeneity among women and men, individual resource control, and power-mediated bargaining over resource control in the face of changes in households' economic environments. To explore price effects, the model is used to simulate the income impacts of large increases in cotton prices accompanying fast-paced agricultural liberalisation in Burkina Faso in the 1980s. The paper shows that where resources are controlled individually by household members, rather than pooled, Pareto efficiency in income generation does not hold. The impact of agricultural price policy on poverty is mediated by bargaining over resource control within households. Both the relative bargaining power of women and men and the degree of preference heterogeneity between them play fundamental roles in the outcome of such bargaining. The results point to a lower ability of households to take advantage of price incentives and thereby raise their incomes than a unitary household model, in which preferences do not differ and resources are pooled, predicts. They suggest that the effectiveness of price policy in reducing poverty in the region would be enhanced by taking into account the incentive structure within households as well as individual household members' ability to bargain over the benefit and cost streams flowing from price changes.

N2  - We tested a theoretical model with the Marshallian inefficiency (H1) and threat of eviction (H2) hypotheses having opposite effects on land productivity on sharecropped plots. The model also assumes that kinship contracts may eliminate or reduce the Marshallian inefficiency (H3) and threat of eviction (H4) effects on land productivity. Our empirical findings were consistent with H2 and H4 being true. We found higher land productivity on sharecropped plots than on share tenants' own plots and higher land productivity on sharecropped plots of nonkin than of kin tenants. The nature of the data allowed controlling for unobservable household characteristics through household fixed effects and for observable plot characteristics. Analyses with and without plot characteristics revealed that these findings were stronger with plot characteristics than without them. Based on the plausible assumption that observable plot characteristics are positively correlated with unobservable plot characteristics this strengthens our conclusion. The results are also supported by first-order stochastic dominance analysis. Sharecropped plots' output value distribution unambiguously dominated the output value distribution from share tenants' own plots. Nonkin sharecropped plots' output value distribution also first-order stochastically dominated the output value distribution from kin sharecrop plots.

N2  - This paper empirically investigates the relationship between contractual arrangements and their enforcement in Chinese agriculture. Based on an analysis of a survey of 100 agribusiness firms engaged in contract farming in Zhejiang province of China, we find that private contract enforcement mechanisms play an important role in influencing smallholders' decisions to breach or fulfill contracts. Contract arrangements such as floor pricing, or requiring smallholders to make specific investments facilitate self-enforcement and significantly improve the smallholder's contract fulfillment rate. This is particularly important in Chinese agriculture since the business environment is characterized by an absence of effective public enforcement institutions.

N2  - Conservation agriculture (CA) is often perceived to provide "win-win" outcomes for farmers leading to reduced erosion and off-site sedimentation, as well as improved soil fertility and productivity. However, adoption rates for CA in many regions of the world remain below expected levels. This article looks at the effects of participation in organic markets and farmers' organizations on the adoption of soil conservation practices. Based on original survey data from 241 small-scale farm households in Honduras, we find that both participation in organic markets and farmer-based groups have positive effects on the number of soil conservation practices adopted. The results indicate that besides supply-oriented policy measures, such as the provision of technical assistance and extension, demand-related factors are likely to play an important role in sustainable soil management. Demand-oriented policy measures include support for labeling initiatives and consumer education to facilitate value-added product differentiation and market segmentation.

N2  - Although a large theoretical literature discusses the possible inefficiency of sharecropping contracts, empirical evidence on this phenomenon has been ambiguous at best. Household-level fixed-effect estimates from about 8,500 plots operated by households that own and sharecrop land in the Ethiopian highlands provide support for the hypothesis of Marshallian inefficiency. At the same time, a factor adjustment model suggests that the extent to which rental markets allow households to attain their desired operational holding size is limited. Our analysis points toward factor market imperfections (no rental for oxen), lack of alternative employment opportunities, and tenure insecurity as possible reasons underlying such an outcome. They suggest that, rather than worrying only about Marshallian inefficiency, attention to the broader environment and policy framework within which producers can adjust to their optimum operational area will be warranted.

N2  - This paper discusses the regulation on transgenic cotton in perspective of actual practices and needs of small farmers in Chaco Province, Argentina. The aim is to disentangle the extent to which the existing regulation take account of all farmers' practices and whether existing regulation, as it is designed and implemented has had any effect on improving the livelihood of poor cotton farmers. Based on fieldwork done in Chaco in June 2008, we claim that the regulatory designs neglected to take into account small farmers' traditional long-standing practices regarding relations within the value chain. As a consequence, poor farmer's real seed trade occurs beyond The Seed Law. On the one hand, this implies that these farmers do not pay royalties on IPR. But on the other hand it also implies they have no protection over the quality of seeds they buy. Moreover, informality also creates risks at national level because it introduces further weakness in the ways in which ecological risks can be managed, and potentially threatens continued access to international markets. The paper put forward guidelines for policy action.

N2  - Multi-agent systems (MAS) open new modelling and analysis perspectives in ecological and social sciences. An original characteristic of the companion modelling (ComMod) approach adopted in this case study is the co-construction and use of a MAS model with and for local stakeholders such as farmers and local administrators. Alternating iteratively field and modelling activities, this approach facilitates collective learning among local stakeholders and between them and the researchers. Combining the use of MAS models with role-playing games (RPG), the described experiment aimed to facilitate collective decision-making in a socially heterogeneous community of small farmers in mountainous Northern Thailand about the local rules for the allocation of rural credit to allow a more equitable and extensive process of expansion of non-erosive perennial crops in a watershed prone to erosion. This paper presents the MAS model and the results of a series of simulations exploring the ecological, social and economic effects of various rules for formal and informal credit suggested by the villagers-participants. Six scenarios considered as pertinent to further explore the participants' suggestions were defined based on different combinations among the following three variables: (i) duration for the reimbursement of loans, (ii) mode of allocation of formal credit among three different types of farms, and (iii) configuration of networks of acquaintances for access to informal credit. Drawing on this case study, we first elaborate on the potential of bottom-up models such as MAS to analyze the functioning of agricultural systems, in particular farm differentiation and rural credit dynamics. We highlight the ability of MAS to deal with interactions between social and ecological dynamics and to provide an alternative to classical economic thinking by analyzing the effects at the village level of social interactions among individuals. MAS allow us in particular to trigger an overlooked but nevertheless fundamental aspect of socio-ecological systems, i.e., social capital which is a determining factor when dealing with sustainability issues. The second question addressed in this paper deals with the potential and limits of MAS models to support a bottom-up (or participatory) modelling approach. This experiment suggests that the usefulness of models relies much more on the modelling process than on the model itself, because a model is usually useless if it is misunderstood by its potential users, or if it does not respond to their current preoccupations. The intuitive representation of real systems provided by MAS and their high flexibility are the two underlined characteristics favouring their appropriation by local stakeholders.

N2  - This article explores the motivations behind the decision of small-scale producers to grow nontraditional vegetables under contract for export. Based on a survey of small-scale producers in Zimbabwe, four factors are identified as motivating contracting, namely, market uncertainty, indirect benefits (e.g., knowledge acquisition), income benefits, and intangible benefits. Respondents are clustered according to the relative importance of these factors in their contracting decision. Four clusters are identified and related to the characteristics of these farmers including size of the farm, amount of land devoted to export crops, access to alternative markets, and the proportion of family income derived from export crops. The results suggest that there are systematic differences between farmers in their decisions to contract which needs to be recognized in contract design and management.

N2  - This paper examines why farm households seek informal loans in Piura, Peru, where formal lenders offer loans at lower interest rates. A panel data econometric analysis reveals that the informal sector serves various types of clients: households excluded from the formal sector but also households that prefer informal loans because of lower transaction costs or lower risk. An in-depth examination of contract terms and loan technologies permits an accurate comparison of effective loan costs and contractual risk across sectors and reveals that proximity and economies of scope enjoyed by informal lenders enable them to substitute information-intensive screening and monitoring for contractual risk and supply these various types of clients.

N2  - This study presents the results of an empirical investigation into the effects of market reform programmes in Ethiopia and their impact on the volatility of coffee prices. The study covers the period from 1982 to the end of 2001, though its main focus is on the period after the commencement of the reforms in 1992. Using the Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) techniques, we argue that there is evidence that Ethiopia experienced a significant increase in coffee price volatility after the adoption of the market-oriented reform programmes. This is consistent with much of the literature. The econometric evidence presented in the paper, suggests that the market reform programmes were a significant cause of the increased volatility after 1992. The authors also suggest a number of possible policy responses to the price volatility, including strengthening the role of smallholder producer associations; and the possibility of adopting appropriate risk-management strategies.

N2  - China's Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) is the largest land retirement/reforestation program in the developing world, having the goal of converting 14.67 million hectares of cropland to forests by 2010 (4.4 million of which is on land with slopes greater than 25 degrees) and an additional "soft" goal of afforesting a roughly equal area of wasteland by 2010. Pending successful completion it could represent a 10-20% increase in China's national forest area and a 10% decrease in current cultivated area. In contrast to China's other forest-sector policies, SLCP uses a public payment scheme that directly engages millions of rural households as core agents of project implementation, and has the stated principals of volunteerism. Thus, insofar as current or future de facto program implementation involves decentralized, voluntary grassroots participation, SLCP represents an important departure from "business as usual" in how China manages its forest resources. This work draws upon current available research of the program and uses a 2003 household and village-level survey conducted by the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy, CAS, to examine program design, implementation, and outcomes to date. Results indicate that significant problems in design and implementation exist, with these including shortfalls in subsidies delivered, lack of respect of the principals of volunteerism, and insufficient technical support and budgeting for local implementation costs. More fundamentally, some program goals appear to be based on common misperceptions regarding the linkages between forests and watershed services. Overall, SLCP contains both innovative elements (volunteerism and the direct engagement of farmers) as well as components that hark back to policies and mindsets of decades past (the program's top-down, simplified contract structure, lack of sufficient consultation with local communities and rural households, and campaign-style mobilization). The paper concludes by providing four main suggestions to improve the program: 1) increase local community input in design and implementation, and ensure that households have full autonomy in participation choice; 2) improve technical support and budgeting for local administrative costs and capacity building; 3) clarify the environmental services targeted and verify the measures needed to acquire these services; and 4) integrate SLCP into an overall package of complementary policies aimed at the rural sector.

N2  - In this paper, I use the Monash Multi-Country model--a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model of China, Australia, and the Rest of the World--to analyse the effects of removing border protection on wheat and rice in China. The analysis points to the possibility that removing border protection on wheat and rice may lead to an increase in rural income in China. This is mainly due to the following two factors. First, removing border protection on wheat and rice not only leads to a contraction in agricultural activities, but also leads to an expansion in manufacturing and services activities. Second, on average, rural households in China obtain over half of their income from manufacturing and services activities.

N2  - Najma Sadeque argues that the future of Pakistan's agriculture could go in two possible directions--working the soil to death chasing export monoculture and thereby hastening desertification and the collapse of the farm sector and the economy at large, or returning to intensive, small-scale and collective organic farming. If it chooses the latter path, the process of rediscovering traditional farming methods would create space for small farmers to help bring about a degree of egalitarianism and true free enterprise--reluctantly on the part of the power-holders, but permitted out of sheer need rather than for any ideological reasons.

N2  - This article evaluates a hybrid seed contract between Indonesian smallholders and Pioneer Hybrid International. A transaction cost approach was used to analyse contract participation, total farm gross margins and labour and chemical use. The empirical results suggest: (a) the contract favours farmers with more irrigated land; (b) the contract improved returns to farm capital and was welfare improving; (c) the contract increased the demand for non-family labour, particularly female labour; and (d) the contract increased the intensity of chemical use. The success of the contract was attributed to the nature of the contracting process, which was between Pioneer and grower groups and not individual smallholders.

N2  - This article examines the emergence and benefits of contract farming in East Java, Bali, and Lombok, Indonesia. After a general review of contract farming in these regions, three contracts, for seed corn in East Java, seed rice in Bali, and broilers in Lombok are described and analyzed using key informant interviews and household survey data. A review of the contracts suggest that there is a wide array of contract types and this is related to the technical requirements of production and the associated costs. Probit analysis is used to identify factors contributing to smallholder participation in farm contracts and a two-stage estimation process used to measure the effects of farm contracts on gross margins and labor use. Results indicate participation in contracts is influenced by farm size and other factors such as smallholder's age, education, and participation in farm groups. Contracts increased returns to capital for the seed corn and broiler contracts but not for the seed rice contract. All three contracts influenced the types of labor used; however, none of them influenced total farm employment.

N2  - Using a comparative study of farm households from poor rural communities in Kyrgyzstan and north-east Romania this paper explores the intricacies of a variety of forms of cooperation in agriculture. The findings highlight the safety net, labour specialisation, asset-pooling and service delivery functions of different groups that enable rural livelihoods to, at times, cope and at times improve in situations of imperfect information, sluggish labour and land markets, and constrained capital markets. The research presented here indicates that small to medium forms of cooperation provide the rural poor with predictable livelihood strategies under conditions of uncertainty. Specifically, cooperative action, in the form of groups, substitutes for imperfect markets. Despite the push for decollectivisation and privatisation across transition countries there remains a place for encouraging group initiatives, at least for the medium term, on the grounds of both poverty alleviation and agricultural growth.

N2  - What motivates family members to share resources? Past research argues for, on the one hand, love and altruism, and on the other, the expectation of reciprocity. Drawing on this literature, this paper examines intergenerational transfers between small farmers and their non-coresident children in the rural area around the city of Altamira, Para, Brazil. We apply GoM (Grade of Membership) models to create profiles of private transfers, using data collected in 2005 by a team from Indiana University. The results show three profiles: low intergenerational transfers, high levels of transfers of visits and help, and high levels of transfers of visits and money. There is no clear difference in profile by birth order, but we do find sex differences in profile. Men are more likely to send money while women provide time transfers (work and visits). Upward transfers are most common from children with high levels of education or living in urban areas, suggesting a repayment of prior investments made by parents. Thus, our empirical evidence supports theories arguing that transfers are motivated by intertemporal contracts between parents and children, and that altruistic theories of family transfers should be rethought among rural agricultural populations in contexts characterized by many environmental and institutional challenges.

N2  - Over the past 15 years income sources in the Amazonian community of Carvao have diversified to include government salaries, retirement and welfare benefits, and wages from an evolving informal service sector. These non-farm incomes are now more important to household incomes than the sale of agricultural products. Out of 80 households only three families were found to depend almost entirely on the sale of agricultural goods for cash income. Agriculture is still a part of most families' livelihoods; however, production today is mainly a subsistence activity. Recent changes in Carvao are consistent with trends of livelihood diversification observed in rural societies across the globe. However, current research reveals that Carvao is different from other case studies in a number of ways. A history of livelihoods illustrates that residents in Carvao have always engaged in a range of activities, including farming, extractive activities, and wage labor. New incomes are the result of new jobs in the public sector and social policies benefiting the rural poor. In contrast to the literature on livelihood diversification, the decentralization of the federal government in Brazil has resulted in greater opportunities for rural income and employment. Consistent with recorded trends, research shows that small farmers in Carvao have down-sized agricultural production. Farmers cite low market prices (the result of vertical integration of local markets) as one cause of this decline. Residents, especially small farmers, interested in diversifying agricultural production are limited by inadequate extension services and credit, and younger residents seek public sector employment. Income diversification has increased livelihoods security; however, future livelihoods will depend on new economic growth. Given the stagnating public sector and a weak industrial sector, production geared toward growing urban markets is a viable means for further income generation in Carvao.

N2  - The 48 organic-certified members of the Ezemvelo Farmers' Organisation in KwaZulu-Natal were surveyed during October-November 2004 to assess what factors they perceive constrain the competitiveness of a formal supply chain that markets their amadumbe, potatoes and sweet potatoes. They identified uncertain climate, tractor not available when needed, delays in payments for crops sent to the pack-house, lack of cash and credit to finance inputs, and more work than the family can handle as the current top five constraints. Principal Component Analysis further identified three valid institutional dimensions of perceived constraints and two valid farm-level dimensions. Potential solutions to better manage these constraints are discussed, including the need for the farmers to renegotiate the terms of their incomplete business contract with the pack-house agent.

N2  - The Decree 46 of 1992 created the National Board for Community Banks which was granted the power to license community banks. Community banks were created to: (1) promote rural development through provision of banking and financial services, (2) enhance rural productive activities, and (3) improve economic status of small-scale producers in rural and urban areas. According to Marx (2004), Nigeria has a dynamic informal financial sector. A key to growth strategy is to assist the development of this informal sector. The recent government policy to rid the economy of community banks defeats the original purpose underlying the creation of community banks. In view of the important role of community banks in Nigeria, the authors propose that community banks should continue to be rural financial institutions with specialized methods to serve broad segments of the rural population. The National Board for Community Banks should be vested with power to license, monitor, and regulate community banks, and the regulatory power of the Central Bank of Nigeria over community banks should not go beyond that necessary for the performance of its monetary policy function. Furthermore, a partnership should be formed between the National Board for Community Banks, National Association of Community Banks, and the Nigeria Agricultural, Cooperative and Rural Development Bank for the purpose of funding rural ventures through loan syndication. The Bankers' Committee initiative for small and medium enterprises funding should be channeled through the Nigeria Agricultural, Cooperative and Rural Development Bank.

N2  - Rural non-farm employment is important in a developing economy like Nigeria because of its significance in the modernization of the farming sector, and transformation of the rural environment. The rural economy of Abuja is characterized by petty trading, carpentry, construction work for buildings, roads, etc., and community services. This paper identifies the major determinants of non-farm employment adoption decisions among rural households in Abuja, Federal Capital Territory, FCT). In this study, ten explanatory variables were tried, using a binary-choice model-probit analysis. Six explanatory variables (namely: age of household head, income, the extent of commercialization, membership of cooperative credit associations, wealth situation and gender) gave significant results. The study maintains that agricultural employment will continue to be directly responsible for a substantial proportion of rural income. The promotion of rural non-farm employment should, therefore, not be made at the cost of shifting resources from the agricultural sector. Rather, it should involve the mobilization of additional investment and capacity for the development of agricultural activities, so that non-farm employment can be less lucrative.

N2  - Loans have became a common occurrence in many households, contributing to household activities and productivity. An empirical analysis and comparative study on the loan trends of 3,331 farming households from the five provinces of Shanxi, Hubei, Henan, Jiangsu, and Jilin are the focus of this study. Findings indicate that civilian loans are prevalent in China's rural areas and play an important part in the livelihoods of many farming households. Loan action is found to be rational; reflecting differences in government policies, in various periods and locations. The study also looks at the popularity of "affection" loans, the relation between loan length and repayment amount and the propensity of loan contracts, as well as considering the impacts of gender, age, and educational level on a household's loan activity.

N2  - Pluralism adds depth to the mixing of methods in development studies. Global society has both structure and complexity, and agents within society actively promote competing ways of describing and interpreting that society. Theoretical pluralism offers a way for social scientists to describe and judge the competing theories about a given social situation. (Methodological pluralism is also discussed in this paper.) An example--tenancy in India--is explored to illustrate how pluralists compare theories. The tenancy literature includes neoclassical, institutionalist, and Marxist theories. These cut across three academic disciplines. Pluralist research is often interdisciplinary in such ways. Such interdisciplinary research generates a dialogue across epistemological chasms and across theories that have different underlying assumptions. Pluralist research can be valued for its discursive bridging function. Pluralist research can also contribute to improvements in scientific measurement. Divergent schools of thought can be brought into contact by reconceptualising the objects of research, such as contracts or coercion. In the tenancy literature, alternative ways of measuring and interpreting power arose. Structuralist approaches tended to assume poverty and inequality as part of the context within which economic action takes place. Strengths and weaknesses of such assumptions are examined. The approach recommended here, which is realist, makes possible an improved dialogue about policy changes aimed at poverty reduction.

N2  - Evidence from sample surveys and local field studies have long supported opposed arguments about the impact of market reform on the value of political office in the rural economy. This article reviews the evidence, describes a gradual convergence in findings, and identifies unresolved questions about qualitatively different local paths of development. Examining previously unexploited data from a nationally representative 1996 survey, a resolution of the remaining issues becomes evident. The value of political office initially is very modest, as the first private entrepreneurs reaped large incomes. However, subsequent economic development led to rapid increases in the earning power of cadres and their kin, and by the end of the Deng era the returns to political office were roughly equal to those of private entrepreneurs. The political advantages were not limited to regions that industrialized rapidly under collective ownership: they were large even in regions where the private economy was most extensive. However, despite evidence of large and enduring political advantages, those who reaped wealth from political position were only a small fraction of the newly rich, the vast majority of whom achieved wealth without current or past office-holding or kinship ties to cadres.

N2  - A supply chain in disarray can be identified as a barrier not only to growth for the agricultural sector but also to achieving food security in a country because it may lead to either a deficiency in food production and/or too high prices. Using the dairy sector of Malawi as an example, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the coherence between market structure and the development strategy pursued by international donors. Within Malawi the dairy sector may be characterised as a segmented market: with both formal and informal milk markets, with smallholder producers serving both markets. The formal market includes few processing firms operating with idle capacity and selling dairy products to an affluent segment of the urban population, whilst the informal market comprises the sale of unprocessed milk products to the less affluent urban population and also rural areas. In this context, cooperative international action, conducted through agencies from a range of countries, is targeted at improving the efficiency of the formal supply chain and also the creation of local supply chains that sell processed products directly to poor consumers. The paper discusses reasons why these two cooperation strategies, given the structure of the sector, may potentially conflict with each other, the need to address the degree of market imperfection of the formal sector and the desirability of ex-ante coordination of plans amongst donors.

N2  - Changes in agricultural practices can play a pivotal role in climate change mitigation by reducing the need for land use change as one of the biggest sources of GHG emissions, and by enabling carbon sequestration in farmers' fields. Expansion of smallholder and commercial agriculture is often one of the main driving forces behind deforestation and forest degradation. However, mitigation programmes such as REDD+ are geared towards conservation efforts in the forestry sector without prominently taking into account smallholder agricultural interests in project design and implementation. REDD+ projects often build on existing re- and afforestation projects without major changes in their principles, interests and assumptions. Informed by case study research and interviews with national and international experts, we illustrate with examples from Ethiopia and Indonesia how REDD+ projects are implemented, how they fail to adequately incorporate the demands of smallholder farmers and how this leads to a loss of livelihoods and diminishing interest in participating in REDD+ by local farming communities. The study shows how the conservation-based benefits and insecure funding base in REDD+ projects do not compensate for the contraction in livelihoods from agriculture. Combined with exclusive benefit-sharing mechanisms, this results in an increased pressure on forest resources, diverging from the principal objective of REDD+. We note a gap between the REDD+ narratives at international level (i.e. coupling development with a climate agenda) and the livelihood interests of farming communities on the ground. We argue that without incorporating agricultural interests and a review of financial incentives in the design of future climate finance mechanisms, objectives of both livelihood improvements and GHG emission reductions will be missed. Key policy insights: REDD+ is positioned as a promising tool to meet climate, conservation and development targets. However, these expectations are not being met in practice as the interests of smallholder farmers are poorly addressed; REDD+ policy developers and implementers need more focus on understanding the interests and dynamics of smallholder agriculturalists to enable inclusive, realistic and long-lasting projects; For REDD+ to succeed, funders need to consider how to better ensure long-term livelihood security for farming communities.

N2  - By exploring problems of risk, asymmetric information and missing markets, development microeconomics have made progress in explaining the underlying rationale and consequences of different contractual arrangements often observed in poor agrarian economies. But the recent theoretical literature has left little room for influences arising from cultural values and norms. By recognizing that individual behavior is socially embedded it is possible to reach a fuller understanding of agrarian organization in the Third World. This point is illustrated by using the land-lease market in Bangladesh as an example. By incorporating a quest for status into a model of sharecropping I seek to explain the well documented fact that landless farm-workers are almost excluded from the land lease market in Bangladesh.

N2  - Innovation platforms are established to facilitate open communication and collaboration among various actors usually within a value chain to promote collective resource management. The concept of innovation platform as a strategy of entry point for operationalization, validation and dissemination of agricultural technology have received much attention in recent times among researchers in Ghana. However, very limited information exists on the factors that influence willingness of farmers' participation. The present study identified the factors influencing willingness to participate in innovation platform and also tested the level of agreement among the identified constraints associated with participation using the Probit model and Kendall's coefficient of concordance respectively. Data for the study was collected from a cross sectional primary observations of 250 smallholder rice farmers in northern Ghana. The study observes, inter alia, that age of household head, household size and household income significantly influenced willingness to participate on the platform. The Kendall's coefficient of concordance value indicated that there was 21 percent agreement between the rankings of the participation constraints faced by the sampled rice farmers. Income-earning and younger household heads must be targeted coupled with situation of the platforms close to smallholder farmers to encourage participation.

N2  - Imperfect competition among purchasers of coffee is a common problem for small scale producers. Producer-owned marketing cooperatives can reduce the market power of private purchasers and restore competition. Non-members as well as members of the cooperatives will then receive higher prices. In the present paper I carry out a theoretical and an empirical investigation into the effect of Fairtrade and organically certified cooperatives on local competition and coffee prices in Chiapas, Mexico. A theoretical model is presented which explains how the competitive effect may work in this particular setting, where cooperative membership implies certain costs that are perceived differently by different producers. Also, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, I present evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis of a pro-competitive effect of cooperatives.

N2  - In this paper we use a subjective well-being approach to evaluate the welfare impact of contract-farming. We analyze the impact of contract-farming on self-reported happiness using original panel data from a farm-household survey in the Niayes region in Senegal. We use different econometric techniques and show that, when correcting for time invariant unobserved heterogeneity, contract-farming has a positive effect on subjective well-being. We find diverging effects for different types of contracts, suggesting that contract-farming contributes more to farmers' subjective well-being under certain conditions and contract design. Our main finding corroborates earlier findings from empirical studies using cross-sectional data and income-based measures of welfare. In line with earlier results from the subjective well-being literature, we find that absolute income has a positive but decreasing effect on subjective well-being while comparison income has a negative effect. Also household demographic characteristics, their land and livestock assets, and housing indicators affect subjective well-being.
