TI  - Household level spillover effects from biofuels: Evidence from castor in Ethiopia
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - The indirect effects of biofuels are mostly considered negative. In this paper, we argue that there may be a positive indirect effect of biofuels on food security and poverty. Using micro-level evidence and a matched plot pair design through which we control for plot and farmer characteristics, we show that the introduction of castor production for biofuel in a poor country as Ethiopia can significantly improve food productivity of rural households who produce raw material for biofuel production. This spillover seems particularly linked to enhanced access to inputs and technical assistance which were provided as part of biofuel feedstock production contracts. Our results thus document another mechanism through which biofuels may influence smallholders' food security, a mechanism that did not receive attention so far. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Opening Cracks for the Transgression of Social Boundaries: An Evaluation of the Gender Impacts of Farmer Research Teams in Honduras
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Participatory agricultural platforms, such as farmer research teams and farmer field schools, offer the potential for change that goes far beyond agriculture. The paper reports on a mixed method approach to examining the gendered impacts of a long term farmer research project in Honduras. We show how collective action around food security has the potential to support gendered social change. We argue that mixed gender research teams provide a space where generative empowerment permits both women and men to challenge unequal gender roles and to open cracks for transgressing social boundaries.

TI  - Biofuels and food security: Micro-evidence from Ethiopia
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - There is considerable controversy about the impact of biofuels on food security in developing countries. A major concern is that biofuels reduce food security by increasing food prices. In this paper we use survey evidence to assess the impact of castor production on poor and food insecure rural households in Ethiopia. About 1/3 of poor farmers have allocated on average 15% of their land to the production of castor beans under contract in biofuel supply chains. Castor production significantly improves their food security: they have fewer months without food and the amount of food they consume increases. Castor cultivation is beneficial for participating households' food security in several ways: by generating cash income from castor contracts, they can store food for the lean season; castor beans preserve well on the field which allows sales when farmers are in need of cash (or food); spillover effects of castor contracts increases the productivity of food crops. Increased food crop productivity offsets the amount of land used for castor so that the total local food supply is not affected. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cooperatives, contract farming, and farm size: The case of tomato producers in Nepal
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - This study investigates the impact of contract farming (CF) through cooperatives in tomatoes on employment and economic performance of smallholders in a low-income developing country. Using farm-level data from Nepal and a nonparametric matching estimator, the study finds a negative and significant effect of CF on employment. However, CF through cooperatives has a positive and significant impact on profits, and yield. We find that small farms (0.51ha) with contracts tend to gain in profits and yield per hectare. However, large farms (>0.85 ha) with contracts employ significantly less hired labor per hectare. Finally, our estimates reveal that, compared to independent producers, smallholder households in Nepal that engaged in CF with both input and output conditions received, on average, higher profits and yield. Findings underscore the importance of cooperatives and CF. [EconLit citations: C31, D23, Q12, Q13]

TI  - Does cooperative membership matter for women's empowerment? Evidence from South Indian dairy producers
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS
AB  - Rural women substantially contribute to agricultural production and development in South Asia, and farmer cooperatives have been promoted to empower them. However, there is limited evidence regarding the effects of cooperative membership on women. In this paper, we evaluate impacts of membership in women-only and mixed-gender cooperatives in South India on women's intra-household decision-making power, using data of 313 female milk producers. Propensity score matching and a two-step control function approach are employed to account for selection bias due to observed and unobserved factors. We find that membership in either women-only or mixed-gender cooperatives has a positive impact on intra-household decision-making power. In particular, members of mixed-gender cooperatives gain significantly more power over decisions regarding dairy production, compared to members of women-only cooperatives. We conclude that women-only cooperatives are not more effective for women's empowerment than mixed-gender cooperatives. However, because women have limited access to mixed-gender cooperatives, women-only cooperatives are generally more accessible for the majority of them.

TI  - Three-stage quantitative approach of understanding household adaptation decisions in rural Cambodia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose A better understanding of the processes that shape households' adaptation decisions is essential for developing pertinent policies locally, thereby enabling better adaptation across scales and multiple stakeholders. This paper aims to examine the determinants of household decisions to adapt, it is also possible to target factors that facilitate or constrain adaptation. This helps to identify key components of current adaptive capacity, which leads to important insights into households' competence to adapt in the future. Design/methodology/approach This paper takes a full-pledged approach examining factors and processes that shape households' climate adaptation decision-making in rural Cambodia at three levels: adaptation status, adaptation intensity and choices of adaptation strategy. The three-stage analyses are materialized by applying the double hurdle model and multivariate probit model, which provides a potential way to systematically assess household adaptation decision-making in rural settings. Findings Results show a high level of involvement in adaptation among local households who are facing multiple stressors including climatic risks. The findings suggest that perceived climate change influence households' decisions in both adaptation status and intensity. Access to financial credit, farmland size, water availability and physical asset holdings are identified as key factors promoting the adoption of more adaptation measures. To facilitate adaptation, collective effort and support at community level is important in providing knowledge based climate information dissemination and early warning systems. Public sector support and development aid programs should focus on positive triggers for targeted community and household adaptation. Originality/value The study, to the authors' best knowledge, is one of the first studies to investigate the determinants of local adaptation decision-making systematically in Cambodia. It also provides a comprehensive approach to improve understanding of adaptation decision-making processes by exploring how various capital assets are associated with different stages of adaptation decisions. The findings contribute to policy implications enlightening adaptation planning at multi-scales with knowledge of key factors, which enhance local adaptive capacity to reduce climate change vulnerability.

TI  - Support for smallholder farmers through Islamic instruments The case of Bangladesh and lessons for Nigeria
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC AND MIDDLE EASTERN FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - In societies with strong presence of Islam, Islamic instrumentswithmore scope for fairness and equity can be innovatively harnessed to play an increasing role in the development process and poverty alleviation schemes. Poor smallholder farmers dominate agricultural production in many developing countries and contribute a significant portion of global food production. This paper aims to develop a scheme to improve poor smallholder farmers' vulnerable financial situation through the application of Zakah and Salam contract, using Bangladesh as a case study. Secondary goals are to show the effect of the scheme on food security and relevance to Nigeria.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors explore the existing traditional modes of financing available to poor smallholders, identify their challenges and propose an appropriate Islamic financing scheme.
   Findings - With the Zakah-based Salam forward contract, the proposed scheme would procure food through Institutional Demand to offer interest free financing, fair price and access to new marketing channels and reduce income uncertainty for the rural smallholders. The discussions indicate that the local food security will be enhanced through incentivized farming activities and disbursement of food from the food bank to the Zakah-eligible food insecure local people.
   Research limitations/implications - This proposal brings forth a potentially powerful idea that needs further empirical validation.
   Originality/value - The religion-based Institutional Demand initiative to promote smallholder agricultural development and social protection is a novel one. The attempt to apply the framework to Nigeria context shows the potential of the framework to generalize for other Muslim developing countries with similar characteristics, especially the poorer agriculture-based countries.

TI  - Impacts of extension access and cooperative membership on technology adoption and household welfare
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - This paper examines the impacts of access to extension services and cooperative membership on technology adoption, asset ownership and poverty using household-level data from rural Nigeria. Using different matching techniques and endogenous switching regression approach, we find that both extension access and cooperative membership have a positive and statistically significant effect on technology adoption and household welfare. Moreover, we find that both extension access and cooperative membership have heterogeneous impacts. In particular, we find evidence of a positive selection as the average treatment effects of extension access and cooperative membership are higher for farmers with the highest propensity to access extension and cooperative services. The impact of extension services on poverty reduction and of cooperatives on technology adoption is significantly stronger for smallholders with access to formal credit than for those without access. This implies that expanding rural financial markets can maximize the potential positive impacts of extension and cooperative services on farmers' productivity and welfare. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Embedding Local Places in Global Spaces: Geographical Indications as a Territorial Development Strategy
T2  - RURAL SOCIOLOGY
AB  - P>Geographical indications (GIs) are place-based names that convey the geographical origin, as well as the cultural and historical identity, of agricultural products. GIs are unique, in that they provide a means of ensuring that control over production and sales of a product stays within a local area, but at the same time they make use of extralocal markets. Although control over GIs largely rests with local actors, GIs are nested in wider regional, national, and international networks; and the passage from local to extralocal markets introduces new costs and benefits and new relations of power into the supply chain. The degree to which GI protection spurs development and protects local environmental and cultural resources depends on the structure of the GI legislation and on the territorial context in which protection is embedded. Using a commodity-chains approach, I compare two GI production systems, tequila in Mexico and Comte cheese in France, in order to develop a theory of the factors that contribute to more sustainable, equitable GI production systems. I argue that three key differences in the design of the GI schemes help to explain the varying effects of the two cases: (1) the manner in which supply-chain actors define quality, (2) the way that the GI valorizes the terroir of the region, and (3) the strength and cohesion that the collective organizing body exhibits. Moreover, the institutional and political context in which GI supply chains "touch down" plays a critical role. Contrary to a conceptualization of GIs as compatible with a purely market-oriented model, my comparison of these two cases indicates that some level of state involvement, in order to level the playing field and empower small farmers, is a necessary, although not sufficient, precondition for successful and sustainable GIs.

TI  - Farm households? flood risk perception and adoption of flood disaster adaptation strategies in northern Ghana
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
AB  - Northern Ghana is noted for its significant contribution to the food basket in Ghana. Farmers in the region suffer severely from extreme climatic conditions, with floods among the most devas-tating disasters. This study uses binary logistic regression model and the Poisson count model to address this threat to food security by analyzing the nexus between flood risk perception and farm households' adoption of flood disaster adaptation strategies in Northern Ghana, including sig-nificant factors such as off-farm employment, cooperative memberships, and access to credit. Results indicate that the flood disaster adaptation rate was low among farmers in the region, with only 41% adopting at least one adaptation strategy. Flood disaster risk perception had a signif-icant effect on farm households' preparedness. Farm households with the perception of severe floods, high probability of flood occurrence, sense of worry, and threats to farm inputs and yield from flood disasters were more likely to adopt more strategies to adapt and mitigate flood risks. Additionally, off-farm employment, cooperative membership, access to credit, extension services, household income, and education significantly affected farmers' flood disaster adaptation behaviour. This study recommends that great attention be shifted towards empowering farm households on flood risk awareness and the fundamental strategies involving on-farm (agronomic practices and farm water distribution) and off-farm practices (off-farm employment and coop-erative memberships) to mitigate flood risks.

TI  - Property Rights Effects on Farmers' Management Investment in Forestry Projects: The Case of Camellia in Jiangxi, China
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - China's central government has carried out a series of collectivization and de-collectivization attempts of forest tenure over time, which have led to multiple forest tenure arrangements within provinces. This paper investigates the motivation of farmers to maintain forestry under various forest tenure regimes. First, the paper provides a qualitative analysis of the different forest tenure regimes using the New Property Rights Theory. Second, an econometric analysis based on data from camellia projects in Jiangxi province is carried out. Camellia projects are long-term projects for the production of non-timber forest products which are important for rural income generation. Qualitative results of the research show that a multitude of different tenure regimes exist across forestry projects. Community-based or collective forest management regimes are the most important tenure regimes in forest management in Jiangxi province. Village communities and farmers are the main actors in forest resource management and investment in camellia projects in Jiangxi province. The results of the econometric analysis show that higher degrees of tenure security and residual claimancy for farm households lead to a higher use of household labor and capital within camellia forestry projects. Uncertainty about the future forestland distribution is an obstacle for household investments in forestry.

TI  - Effect of Forestland Property Rights and Village Off-Farm Environment on Off-Farm Employment in Southern China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Reasonably promoting the off-farm employment of rural surplus labor in China's collective forest areas is an important way to increase forest resources and increase farmers' income. China's new round of collective forest tenure reform (CFTR) aims to optimize forest area labor allocation by strengthening forestland property rights. Therefore, in different village off-farm environments, it is necessary to explore how forestland property rights affect off-farm employment in forest areas. Based on survey data from 742 households in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, this paper examines this effect using the double-hurdle model. The results indicate that forestland transfer rights promote decision-making about, and the supply of, off-farm labor, while forest harvesting rights significantly increase the supply of off-farm labor. The villages' off-farm income ratio also affected the supply of off-farm labor. Moreover, under the regulation of the village off-farm income ratio, the positive incentives of forestland transfer rights on decision-making about, and the supply of, off-farm labor gradually weakened, but the incentive effect of forest harvesting rights on the supply of off-farm labor gradually increased. It is proposed that the CFTR should be further promoted, the forestland circulation mechanism and regulating forest harvest quota system should be improved, and implementation of forestry property mortgages should be strengthened.

TI  - Women's decision-making roles in vegetable production, marketing and income utilization in Nepal's hills communities
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Women in rural Nepal are increasingly interested in vegetable production and marketing (VPM) to earn income. Such innovative behavior conflicts with traditional patriarchal socio-cultural norms and is still relatively rare. Constrained by limited economic opportunities, smallholder households are increasingly under pressure to meet livelihood needs. In depth interviews, focus group discussions and field observations reveal family members, especially husbands and wives, jointly initiate VPM and collectively contest any unfavorable socio-cultural practices against women in these activities. Earning income, training, exposure visits, peer learning, women's group activities and program subsidies strongly support women's negotiations with their husbands and extended family members regarding continued and intensified VPM and expanded decision-making roles. Young and educated women more commonly contest restrictive practices and participate in all types of important decisions. Women manage household cash, have more freedom to spend income, and feel a strong sense of dignity and empowerment. However, some women still rely on their husbands for important decisions and are hesitant to travel to markets for training and exposure visits. Overall, we find clear evidence of women as active decision makers, farm managers and income earners.

TI  - The role of social capital in the promotion of conservation farming: The case of 'landcare' in the southern Philippines
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - 'Social capital' refers to the relationships of trust, communication, and cooperation that facilitate collective action in a community. It is particularly relevant to soil conservation in developing countries, which requires collective efforts to raise awareness of soil degradation, provide effective training in soil conservation practices, and implement soil conservation measures on individual farms. The Landcare Program in the Southern Philippines promotes simple conservation practices in upland environments through establishing and supporting community landcare groups and municipal landcare associations, thus augmenting the social capital of farmers in these locations. An evaluation of the Landcare Program in Barangay Ned, South Cotabato, based on a survey of 313 farm households and case studies of nine landcare groups, shows that, despite extreme isolation and difficult working conditions, farmers responded by rapidly forming landcare groups and a landcare association, and adopting contour barriers on their maize farms. They utilized the bonding social capital inhering in their local communities to build stocks of bridging social capital, linking them to information, training and resources from outside their immediate locality. A logistic regression model of the factors affecting adoption of contour barriers shows that farmers who had undergone the practical, farmer-based training provided by the Landcare Program, and who were members of a landcare group, were significantly more likely to adopt conservation measures. These results confirm the value of investing in social capital to promote soil conservation. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Is Migration in Africa always a Household Decision? Consensus and Contestation in the Rural-Urban Migration Decisions of Ghanaian Women
T2  - FEMINIST ECONOMICS
AB  - The dominant theoretical framework for analyzing migration in Africa rests on the assumption of cooperative intrahousehold decision making regarding the mobility of household members. This framework, applied to women's migration, overlooks the varied decision-making processes underlying their mobility, and obscures their ability to act as purposeful agents in making decisions about migration. Drawing on a study of women's rural-urban migration in Ghana, this article argues that women's migration decisions exist on a continuum defined by the presence or absence of intrahousehold contestation and the degree of agency exercised by the migrants themselves. Consequently, household models of migration may not always be the appropriate theoretical framework for the analysis of women's migration in this context. The findings presented have implications for economic analyses of women's migration and remittances, for our understanding of migrant women's capacity for agency, and for the design of effective policies to improve migration outcomes for women.

TI  - Risk Attitude, Contract Arrangements and Enforcement in Food Safety Governance: A China's Agri-Food Supply Chain Scenario
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Frequent food safety problems in recent years have seriously affected China's public health. The complexity, diversity, and technicality of food safety problems are intertwined, which constantly promotes the Chinese government and the food industry to explore effective food safety governance mechanisms. As the dominant form of vertical coordination in agri-food supply chain, contract farming is conducive to promoting farmers' safe production behavior, improving food quality and safety, and ensuring public health. However, the low contract performance rate seriously restricts the effect of contract farming on reducing the risk of food safety in China. This paper empirically investigates the role of farmers' risk attitude and contract arrangements in their enforcement. The data is derived from a household survey and economic field experiment of fruit farmers participating in contract farming in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces of China. We measure farmers' risk attitude by using an economic field experiment, and examine how risk attitude and contract arrangements affect contract enforcement with a probit model. The results show that contract enforcement is significantly (1% level) influenced by farmers' risk attitude. Farmers with greater risk aversion and loss aversion and farmers who are more accurate in evaluating probability information are more likely to fulfill the contract. Additionally, most contract arrangements have a significant effect on contract enforcement at the 5% level. Contract arrangements with floor pricing, bonus, and long duration are related to a higher rate of farmers' contract performance. Furthermore, the factors influencing contract enforcement differ based on the levels of farmer' risk attitude. The findings of the study may be conducive to formulating relevant agricultural policy to influence farmers' decision-making and thus improving food safety and ensuring public health.

TI  - Cooperative membership and dairy performance among smallholders in Ethiopia
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - This study assesses the impact of cooperative membership among dairy producers in Selale, Ethiopia. We selected ten impact indicators: proportion of dairy income to total household income, total dairy income, proportion of crossbreed cows to the total number of cows in the herd (indicator of technological innovation), amount of feed bought (another indicator of technological innovation), milk production, milk productivity, commercialization, price per liter of milk, price per kg of butter and the share of milk production that is processed at the household level. In order to minimize the biases that may arise by simply comparing members and non-members, we employed a propensity score matching technique. The empirical analysis shows that cooperatives are strong in facilitating technological transformations and commercialization but weak in offering better prices. These findings suggest structural trade-offs between different domains of cooperatives' action. Overall, our study concludes that cooperatives can be efficient business institutions to foster rural development and food security. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Adoption of dual-purpose forages: some policy implications
T2  - TROPICAL GRASSLANDS
CP  - Workshop on Forage Demand and Adoption by Smallholder Livestock Keepers
AB  - Livestock, especially ruminant, production is an important component of farming systems in upland areas of the Philippines. Moreover, since upland agriculture is becoming unsustainable because of soil erosion and productivity of crops is limited by poor soils, livestock production is a particularly valuable source of income to complement crop production. Farmers rely heavily on livestock to provide a source of savings, cash income, draft power and nutritious food. Nevertheless, scarcity and poor quality of feed are major constraints to improved livestock productivity in upland areas. Introduction of planted forages in these systems has the potential to increase substantially the quality and quantity of available forages, thus providing fodder to supplement low-quality naturally occurring forages and crop residues; concurrently, forage plants promote sustainability by improving soil quality and reducing soil erosion.
   Adoption of forages by smallholder farmers in the rainfed upland areas of the Philippines is conditioned by the dual-purpose role of forage plants. A number of forage species have been used as contour hedgerow species for the reduction of soil erosion. These include Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Setaria spp., napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) and vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides). These species were chosen as hedgerow species because of their value as fodder for livestock, in addition to their roles in reducing soil erosion, controlling weed growth, and improving and stabilising fallow areas.
   A number of constraints affect the widespread adoption of forages for use as hedgerow species by smallholder farmers in the Philippine uplands. These factors include: the limited availability of seed; high mortality amongst the forage species planted; a lack of collective action; and the high initial cost of investment. Insufficient attention has been given to policy and socio-economic factors affecting adoption of forages. For example, the effects of socio-economic factors such as human capital (education, age), income and access to institutions (e.g. credit and extension) have not been studied in association with the adoption of forage species. Therefore, policy and technology options to address these issues are warranted.
   This paper uses an econometric approach (i.e. probit) to identify the factors affecting adoption of forages by smallholder fanners in the upland areas of the Philippines, using data from a survey conducted in 1996 by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The survey examined farmers who had adopted contour hedgerow technology at 2 upland sites, Cebu, Visayas and Claveria, Mindanao, the Philippines.

TI  - Do private standards create exclusive supply chains? New evidence from the Peruvian asparagus export sector
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Developing countries are increasingly exporting fresh horticultural products to high-income countries. These exports increasingly have to comply with stringent public and private standards, as well as other quality and safety issues. There is an ongoing debate on the effect of private standards on the inclusion of small-scale farmers in export supply chains. With this paper, we contribute to this debate by providing new evidence from the Peruvian asparagus export sector, and by addressing several important methodological shortcomings and gaps in the existing literature. We describe export dynamics using a unique firm level dataset on 567 asparagus export firms from 1993 to 2011 and the evolution of certification to private standards using own survey data from a stratified random sample of 87 export firms. We use an unbalanced panel of the surveyed companies on 19 years and several methods, including fixed effects and GMM estimators, to estimate the causal impact of certification to private standards on companies' sourcing strategy. We find that certification leads to vertical integration and significantly reduces the share of produce that is sourced from external producers, with a larger effect for small-scale producers. When distinguishing between production and processing standards, and between low-level and high-level standards, we find that especially high-level production standards have a negative impact on sourcing from (small-scale) producers.

TI  - Agricultural policies and the emergence of cotton as the dominant crop in northern Cote d'Ivoire: Historical overview and current outlook
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
AB  - In most of sub-Saharan Africa, where the agricultural sector experiences dismal performance and is characterized by a gloomy picture, the cotton sub-sector in Cote d'Ivoire is often mentioned as a "success story" given the spectacular rise in the quantity of cotton production and the profile of the crop within the farming system. What are the historical and political antecedents of the development of cotton and the factors responsible for the feat accomplished in the midst of general failures in the same continent? To what extent can cotton be regarded as a "success story" and, what lessons can be drawn for agricultural development strategies based on the Ivorian case study? This paper traces the historical and socio-political background of cotton development in Cote d'Ivoire and identifies key policy and institutional interventions that have influenced the rise of cotton production and its emergence as the dominant crop in the farming systems of the country. Four stages in Ivorian cotton development are identified: planning, take off, crisis and the renaissance phases. The study demonstrates how a combination of good planning, technological advancement and appropriate policy and institutional conditions have contributed significantly to the rise of cotton production and its influence on the agricultural economy of northern Cote d'Ivoire. The study also highlights how the sustainability of agricultural development has been impacted by domestic and international policies and political events over which smallholder farm families have little control, and can at best only respond to. Important questions about cotton development in Cote d'Ivoire are raised that need to be answered before the program can be categorized conclusively as a success story. The study shows that there are no quick fixes to agricultural development in the sub-region. Rather, good planning and putting the necessary building blocks in place are important prerequisites. It is recommended that agricultural development efforts in the continent take cognizance of the complexity of the sector and address the inter-relationships that exist among the technical, policy, market and institutional factors that combine individually and collectively to influence African agriculture.

TI  - Ecosystem Services Provision from Urban Farms in a Secondary City of Myanmar, Pyin Oo Lwin
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Urban farms provide a large diversity of ecosystem services, which collectively have a positive effect on different constituents of human wellbeing. However, urban farms are facing increasing pressure due to accelerated urbanization and socioeconomic transformation, especially in rapidly developing countries such as Myanmar. There is an increasing call to harness the multiple benefits that urban farms offer in order to foster urban green economic transitions and increase the wellbeing of urban residents. This study examines how different types of urban farms provide ecosystem services, focusing on Pyin Oo Lwin, one of the secondary cities of Myanmar. We conduct household surveys with urban farmers representing the three main types of urban farms encountered in the city, namely seasonal crop farms (N = 101), coffee farms (N = 20), and nurseries (N = 20). The results suggest that all types of urban farms in our sample provide multiple provisioning, cultural, regulating, and supporting ecosystem services, which collectively contribute directly to different constituents of human wellbeing such as (a) food security, (b) livelihoods and economic growth, and (c) public health and social cohesion. Food crops and commercial crops (e.g., coffee) are the major provisioning ecosystem services provided by our studied urban farms, with some farms also producing medicinal plants. These ecosystem services contribute primarily to farmer livelihoods and economic growth, and secondarily to household food security (through self-consumption) and health (through nutritious diets and medicinal products). Food sharing is a common practice between respondents for building social cohesion, and is practiced to some extent by most seasonal crop farmers. Almost all surveyed urban farms in our sample provide diverse cultural services to their owners, ensuring the delivery of intangible benefits that have a further positive effect on human wellbeing. It is argued that efforts should be made to ensure the continuous supply of these ecosystem services in order to contribute to urban green economic transitions in Pyin Oo Lwin and other similar secondary cities.

TI  - Safety in small numbers: Local strategies for survival and growth in Romania and the Kyrgyz Republic
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - Using a comparative study of farm households from poor rural communities in Kyrgyzstan and north-east Romania this paper explores the intricacies of a variety of forms of cooperation in agriculture. The findings highlight the safety net, labour specialisation, asset-pooling and service delivery functions of different groups that enable rural livelihoods to, at times, cope and tat times improve in situations of imperfect information, sluggish labour and land markets, and constrained capital markets. The research presented here indicates that small to medium forms of cooperation provide the rural poor with predictable livelihood strategies under conditions of uncertainty. Specifically, cooperative action, in the form of groups, substitutes for imperfect markets. Despite the push for decollectivisation and privatisation across transition countries there remains a place for encouraging group initiatives, at least for the medium term, on the grounds of both poverty alleviation and agricultural growth.

TI  - TRANSDISCIPLINARY INNOVATION IN IRRIGATED SMALLHOLDER AGRICULTURE IN AFRICA
T2  - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
AB  - Boosting the productivity of smallholder farming systems continues to be a major need in Africa. Challenges relating to how to improve irrigation are multi-factor and multisectoral, and they involve a broad range of actors who must interact to reach decisions collectively. We provide a systematic reflection on findings from the research project EAU4Food, which adopted a transdisciplinary approach to irrigation for food security research in five case studies in Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, South Africa and Tunisia. The EAU4Food experiences emphasize that actual innovation at irrigated smallholder farm level remains limited without sufficient improvement of the enabling environment and taking note of the wider political economy environment. Most project partners felt at the end of the project that the transdisciplinary approach has indeed enriched the research process by providing different and multiple insights from actors outside the academic field. Local capacity to facilitate transdisciplinary research and engagement with practitioners was developed and could support the continuation and scaling up of the approach. Future projects may benefit from a longer time frame to allow for deeper exchange of lessons learned among different stakeholders and a dedicated effort to analyse possible improvements of the enabling environment from the beginning of the research process.

TI  - What Role(s) Do Village Committees Play in the Withdrawal from Rural Homesteads? Evidence from Sichuan Province in Western China
T2  - LAND
AB  - Village committees, as grassroots spontaneously formed by rural collective members in China's hierarchy system, play an irreplaceable role in the management of rural public affairs. Based on the filed survey dataset taken from three pilot counties/districts in Sichuan province, we explored the significant role that village committees played in farmers' withdrawal from rural homesteads (WRH). Our empirical results, according to binary logistic regression (BLR) modelling, indicated that the WRH was significantly affected by the triple roles of village committees, among which information intermediary was the most effective followed by the trust builder and then the coordinated manager. Firstly, village committees' involvement facilitated the WRH by improving policy transparency and decreasing information cost. Secondly, the depth of village committees' participation (i.e., being involved in multiple phases) positively affected the WRH given its signification of the participation of farmers. Whereas the breadth of participation (i.e., considering various demands of different participants) negatively affected the process of WRH by reducing the decision-making efficiency. Thirdly, farmers' trust in institutions played a positive role in the WRH, but their confidence in village cadres had limited impact. We therefore argue that promising village committees should act as "all-round stewards" in the decision-making of rural households, which not only includes the transmit of information between those above and those below, but also needs to actively strive for farmers' trust by letting their voice heard. Based on our empirical findings, this paper finally proposed some policy suggestions, such as strengthening mutual communication, empowerment of rural grassroots, encouraging farmers' participation and improving formal institutions.

TI  - Factors Affecting Participation in Contract Farming of Smallholder Cavendish Banana Farmers in the Philippines
T2  - AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - Participation of smallholder Cavendish banana farmers in contract farming in the Philippines started with the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law. Multinational and large domestic companies which used to manage their corporate farms had to transfer ownership of lands to the farmers who used to work in these corporate farms. Various contractual arrangements had emerged to engage farmers for these companies to continue their foothold in the export markets where Philippines ranks second. However, some of these arrangements were deemed inequitable that resulted to side-selling and the emergence of spot markets. Participating in contracts or selling in the spot market has corresponding implications to profit generation. Therefore, exploring what influences contract participation of farmers and its role in improving their profit became highly relevant. As such, this paper aimed to examine the factors that affect the decision of farmers to contract or sell in spot market and explore which arrangement yields better profit. Data collected from 187 respondents were analyzed using a probit regression model. Results show that education, farming experience, and credit/financial support significantly affect contract farming participation. The results highlighted the importance of technical skills and knowledge, and financial support in making decisions such as contract participation. Results also show that contract farmers earn higher profits than non-contract farmers which may imply contract farming to be better. Due to the controversies surrounding contract farming, effective mechanisms to regulate contracts are among the recommendations to ensure the welfare of the farmers.

TI  - Large-scale Agro-Industrial Investments and Rural Poverty: Evidence from Sugarcane in Malawi
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES
AB  - This article investigates the potential household welfare implications of large-scale agro-industry investments in Sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, it compares the income and poverty of households integrated into a Malawian sugar investment with those households not integrated. Two different supply-chain set-ups are studied: smallholder outgrower and vertically integrated estate-production systems. Potential selection bias is addressed using propensity score matching and a number of robustness checks. We find significant positive income differences between participants in either supply-chain set-up and the respective counterfactual. Overall, income poverty is significantly lower among outgrowers relative to the counterfactual, whereas in the case of estate workers these differences are only significant for the extreme poverty line. Qualitative interviews confirm these results, but they also allude to risks for the rural poor associated with social conflicts in the expansion of new outgrower schemes as well as a lack of transparency in the operation of existing schemes, which are likely to undermine the poverty-reducing potentials of such investments.

TI  - Smallholder Agricultural Investment and Productivity under Contract Farming and Customary Tenure System: A Malawian Perspective
T2  - LAND
AB  - Land tenure security, especially customary residence systems, is found to influence the agricultural investment decision-making and productivity of smallholder farmers across sub-Saharan Africa. However, as country-specific customary residence systems and farming models evolve over time, their impact on food security and livelihood remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of customary residence systems on both agricultural investment (in tea shrubs and agroforestry) and productivity among contracted smallholder tea outgrowers in Southern Malawi. A survey of 228 farmers was conducted in 2018, and a linear probability and ordinary least squared (OLS) models were used for the analysis. The results suggest that matrilocal residence practices positively influence agricultural investment. The study concluded that despite the dominance of matrilineal-matrilocal systems in Southern Malawi, there is a need for policy to address gender gaps in the region because women are still vulnerable and insecure even in these assumed women-friendly customary systems. It is recommended that future research explores other prevailing tenure security systems.

TI  - Dynamic pathways of barriers and opportunities for food security and climate adaptation in Southern Mali
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Barriers to food security and climate adaptation operate in complex and dynamic ways but are often perceived as static impediments to be overcome. In this study, we apply systems thinking for the assessment of barriers in agricultural decision-making for food security and climate adaptation. Using a mixed method approach of participatory simulation game design and causal loop diagrams, we explore the dynamic pathways through which barriers inhibit farmers from achieving food security and climate adaptation in Southern Mali. Results show that the key barriers in the region are financial, land, and climate-related barriers including unavailability of formal credit sources, high input prices, inadequate land access and ownership rights, time and labor constraints in collective vs individual plots, and climate risks such as early and late season droughts, high temperature, excessive rainfall, water scarcity, and pest incidences. These barriers operate in complex, interdependent, and dynamic ways where factors that act as enablers in one context can also function as barriers in another context. We see such interdependencies in three cases: i) access to interlocked credit and loans for cotton cultivation acts as enablers of income generation for male farmers but become barriers to female farmers who do not cultivate cotton ii) land ownership and land use rights for male farmers act as enablers for cultivation of income generating cash and food crops but acts as a barrier for female farmers by way of intra-household labor dynamics within collective plots iii) increase in land allocation to cotton and maize cultivation acts as enablers for increased household income but becomes a barrier to food security due to higher vulnerability to climate risks. Assessment of causal loop diagrams identified deep and shallow leverage points. Policies and interventions that focused on input subsidies and credit facilities are shallow leverage points where incremental changes will only lead to small improvements in farmers' livelihoods. Policies that support improved access and ownership of land to female farmers are deep leverage points that can potentially shift the dominant cropping pattern to more diversified and climate-resilient production.

TI  - The effect of large-scale agricultural investments on household food security in Madagascar
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Large-scale agricultural investments in developing countries have escalated over the past decade. While much is written about the potential adverse effects of these acquisitions on local communities, there is a paucity of evidence of these impacts. This paper explores the effect of large-scale agribusinesses on household food security in two locations in Madagascar. One is plantation area or Location A and the other one is contract farming area or Location B. The sample of 601 households was classified into households (i) in which at least one member was employed or (ii) contracted to the agribusiness, (iii) in the same area that were neither employees nor contractors (non-engaged) and (iv) counterfactual households from another community. Employment opportunities from the agribusinesses seemed to improved food security. Dietary quality, food security and resilience were higher among employed households. Contract households were generally more food insecure than the counterfactual and non-engaged households. Living in the zone of influence did not seem to have major adverse effects on the food security of non-engaged households. However, female-headed households seemed disadvantaged in terms of access to employment and contracting opportunities. Unless attention is paid to women's access to employment and contracting opportunities, inequality may be exacerbated.

TI  - Agrobiodiversity and Shade Coffee Smallholder Livelihoods: A Review and Synthesis of Ten Years of Research in Central America
T2  - PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER
CP  - 104th Annual Meeting of the Association-of-American-Geographers
AB  - We used households as the primary unit of analysis to synthesize agrobiodiversity research in small-scale coffee farms and cooperatives of Nicaragua and El Salvador. Surveys, focus groups, and plant inventories were used to analyze agrobiodiversity and its contribution to livelihoods. Households managed high levels of agrobiodiversity, including 100 shade tree and epiphyte species, food crops, and medicinals. Small farms contained higher levels of agrobiodiversity than larger, collectively managed cooperatives. Households benefited from agrobiodiversity through consumption and sales. To better support agrobiodiversity conservation, our analysis calls for a hybrid approach integrating bottom-up initiatives with the resources from top-down projects.

TI  - Household Task Delegation among High-Fertility Forager-Horticulturalists of Lowland Bolivia
T2  - CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY
AB  - Human kin cooperation is universal, leading researchers to label humans as "cooperative breeders." Despite widespread interest in human cooperation, there has been no systematic study of how household economic decision making occurs. We document age and sex profiles of task delegation by parents to children ages 4-18 among Bolivian forager-horticulturalists. We test for sex differences in the probability of delegation and examine whether tasks are more likely delegated as household labor demand increases. We also test whether food acquisition tasks are more likely delegated to higher producers. We find mixed support for the prediction that girls are more likely delegated domestic and alloparenting tasks than boys (n = 173 children). Both sexes are more likely delegated tasks during rice harvest months; number of coresident young children is also associated with greater probability of delegated allocare, although the effect retains significance for girls only. For both sexes, father absence is associated with greater probability of delegation, particularly for food acquisition tasks. Children delegated rice harvesting achieve 45% higher mean daily caloric returns from harvesting than children not delegated harvesting. Our results therefore suggest that delegation increases household economic efficiency. We find mixed support for the hypothesis that delegation prepares children for sex-specific adult roles.

TI  - The role of cross-border transhumance in influencing resident herders' cattle husbandry practices and use of genetic resources
T2  - ANIMAL
AB  - For centuries, the humid West African coastal country of Benin attracts cattle herders from neighboring Sahelian countries such as Niger, Burkina Faso and Nigeria. Each year, several thousands of cattle are trekked over hundreds of kilometers to Benin following established and non-established transhumance corridors. This cross-border mobility has been shown to play an important role in ensuring the productivity of the transhumant herds through adequate late dry season access to pastoral resources. Yet, its effects on the traditional agro-pastoral production systems that are encountered along the routes in Benin have never been explicitly investigated. Therefore, we collected socio-economic household data, herd characteristics and management data from 104 resident herders and 38 transhumant herders in 2 vegetation zones of Benin. To determine whether or not the proximity to transhumance corridors affects sedentary production systems, characteristics of cattle herds and farmers' management practices were compared between villages close to (within a 25 km buffer) and far from (outside a 25 km buffer) transhumance corridors within and between vegetation zones using non-parametric statistical tests. Existing relationships between resident and transhumant herders were also identified and characterized. Subsequently, herd characteristics and management practices were compared between resident herders having relationships with transhumant herders and those without. Herd sizes of resident herders living close to transhumance corridors were larger (P< 0.01) than those of their counterparts living far away. Also, proximity to transhumance corridors had positive effects on herd management practices. The relationships between resident and transhumant herders were governed by a variety of interests including encampment/manuring contracts, exploitation of grazing lands and watering points, trading and bartering of cattle. This exchange of cattle is an important driver of change in the breed composition of local herds and represents an opportunity for resident herders to enhance their herds' productivity through crossbreeding. However, the mere replacement or indiscriminate crossbreeding of local cattle breeds with those kept by transhumant herders threatens the sustainability of the traditional resident herding systems by increasing the risk of genetic erosion and loss of valuable adaptive traits in indigenous animal genetic resources.

TI  - The poverty impacts of improved soybean technologies in Malawi
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - Improved soybean varieties and agronomic practices have been widely disseminated to smallholder farmers in Malawi over the last 15 years. However, there is no empirical evidence on the welfare impacts of adopting improved soybean technologies. This paper estimated the poverty impacts of adopting improved soybean technologies using data from 1,234 households in six soybean growing districts accounting for over 80% of the total soybean production in the country. The results from an endogenous switching regression model showed that 32% of the sample households adopted improved soybean varieties and agronomic practices. The adoption benefits were higher for female-headed households and increased with the household head's education and cultivated land areas. A comparison of the observed and counterfactual incomes for adopters based on the international poverty line of US$1.90 per capita per day showed a 4.16 percentage-point reduction in poverty among the sample households, translating to over 150,000 people lifted out of poverty. The household head's education level, household size, cultivated land area, livestock size, and asset ownership are associated with the daily per capita income. The results point to the need for scaling up of improved soybean varieties and agronomic practices for greater impacts on poverty reduction among smallholders in Malawi.

TI  - Risk-sharing networks in rural Philippines
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - Using detailed data on gifts, loans, and asset sales, this paper investigates how rural Filipino households deal with income and expenditure shocks. We find that shocks have a strong effect on gifts and informal loans, but little effect on sales of livestock and grain. Mutual insurance does not appear to take place at the village level; rather, households receive help primarily through networks of friends and relatives. Certain shocks are better insured than others. The evidence is consistent with models of quasi-credit where risk is shared within networks through flexible, zero-interest informal loans combined with pure transfers. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Strategy for Transforming Indonesian Agriculture
T2  - BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - Today agriculture is expected to help countries such as Indonesia to achieve multiple development goals. These goals include not only food security but also higher employment, environmental sustainability, and reduced poverty and malnutrition. Drawing on the literature on agricultural development in Asia, this article proposes four agricultural strategies that could help Indonesia to achieve these goals. First, to efficiently ensure food security, Indonesia should use labour-saving mechanisation and increase the average size of rice farms, in order to reduce wage-related production costs. Second, to ensure environmental sustainability, Indonesia should intensify oil palm production that helps the country meet global demand but also minimise forest loss. Third, to improve health and nutrition, Indonesian agriculture should produce more high-value products such as livestock products and fresh fruit and vegetables. Fourth, to generate more employment opportunities and to reduce poverty, Indonesia should promote rural industrialisation. In proposing these strategies, this article focuses on the agro-industrialisation of the private sector, on public-sector extension for smallholders, and on land rights security for stimulating the production of oil palm. The article finds that major policy change will be needed to achieve efficient, equitable and sustainable growth of agriculture in Indonesia.

TI  - What is the effect of physical activity level on food consumption, energy deficiency, and dietary diversity?
T2  - FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN
AB  - Background. Energy deficiency is observed to be at odds with other food security indicators. In wealthier urban areas, the prevalence of energy deficiency is often higher than in poorer rural areas, whereas other food security indicators, such as food diversity, perform much better in urban than in rural areas.
   Objective. To investigate to what extent differences in physical activity levels influence dietary quantity and quality.
   Methods. Central to this analysis is the construction of a household activity index, a single measure that aims to capture the collective workload of the household. This paper uses data from Nepal and Uganda expenditure surveys that contain information on food consumption, as well as detailed information on how individual household members spend their time. Energy deficiency numbers are adjusted by the activity index, and the results are compared with the standard approach for calculating energy deficiency assuming light activity levels. Regressions are estimated to discuss demand for calories and diversity given the activity level.
   Results. Accounting for differences in activity level has a large effect on energy deficiency figures, particularly in rural areas. The analysis shows that a higher household activity level significantly increases the calories consumed but lessens food diversity, suggesting that households with high activity levels sacrifice diversity for quantity in order to meet their energy requirements.
   Conclusions. Physical activity levels should be taken into account when interpreting empirical differences in food consumption levels for determining the prevalence of food insecurity and making allocation decisions for food security assistance.

TI  - IMPACT OF COOPERATIVES MEMBERSHIP ON ECONOMY IN EASTERN OROMIA: THE CASE OF HARAMAYA AGRICULTURAL FARMERS' COOPERATIVE UNION (HAFCU)
T2  - ANNALS OF PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - This study attempts to analyse the impact of cooperatives on the smallholders' income, productivity, marketed surplus and saving in East Hararghe Zone of Haramaya District. The study is based on primary cross-sectional data collected from cooperative member and non-cooperative member household heads. The propensity score matching (PSM) estimates complemented by a bias correction matching (BCM) and Lewbel instrumental variable (IV) regression estimation shows that cooperatives have a positive impact on smallholders' income and productivity. The findings have strong policy implications. The rural development of the country should work toward strengthening and expanding the existing rural organizations through training and capacity building programmes. It is important particularly establishing new rural-based organizations that enable rural households to engage in business activities. Doing that may help reduce poverty and increase smallholders' income, productivity, and capital accumulation.

TI  - Impact of Participation in Contract Farming on Smallholder Farmers' Income and Food Security in Rural Benin: PSM and LATE Parameter Combined
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Investigated in this work is the impact of contract farming participation on smallholder farmers' income and food security in rice crop production in Northern Benin using 400 randomly selected rice farmer households. Unlike previous studies, we corrected for both observed and unobserved biases by combining propensity score matching (PSM) and the local average treatment effect parameter (LATE). The results showed significant negative consequences of partaking in rice contract farming. We found evidence of significant negative effects on rice production income at a 1% level. The more the rice farmers join in contract farming, the lower the farm income became. Decreased food consumption was also a result of contract farming participation for potential participants by a score of 60.64, placing their households at the food security status level of poor food consumption because the quantity and nutritional quality of the food consumed were inadequate. Contract farming is, therefore, not a reasonable policy instrument that can help farmers increase their income and improve their food security level in the Alibori Department, Benin if farmers do not diversify their crops. The necessary resources and economic environment are not yet in place to allow contract farming to take full advantage of its potential benefits. To prevent the wasting of scarce public resources, expanding contract farming would not be appropriate in marginal areas with markets and other infrastructure. Additional measures are needed for contract farming to be profitable for contracting actors and to ensure sustainability and the large-scale participation of farmers.

TI  - Farmer portfolios, strategic diversity management and climate-change adaptation - implications for policy in Vietnam and Kenya
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Climate variability is contributing to water-scarcity problems in Kenya and to extreme flooding and drought in Vietnam. This paper compares diversity-based climate adaptation approaches in current land use in the Cam Xuyen district, Ha Tinh province, Central Vietnam and in the Kapingazi river watershed in Embu district, Eastern province, Kenya, in order to understand local responses to climate variability and examine the potential for policy support of diversity management by local people. Literature reviews and trend analysis of local time series of rainfall and temperature were combined with stakeholder interviews and workshops to identify technology and policy options for dealing with current and future climate variability. At all study sites, diversity in land use at farm level and along agriculture-forestry landscape gradients was a key strategy. Policy options to support such an approach could include legalization of agroforestry in Vietnam and a combination of regulations and incentive-based approaches to reconcile household decision-making with longer term and collective actions to benefit landscape diversity in Kenya. Lessons learnt in both study areas about payments for environmental services can be used in policy discussions.

TI  - Participatory forest management in Burkina Faso: Members' perception of performance
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB  - This study examines variations in the performance of participatory forest management programs among four forest management groups (FMGs) in southern Burkina Faso, and assesses the factors that influence their members' perceptions of performance through a household survey of 216 members. Variations in performance scores among the FMGs were analyzed through multivariate analysis of variance while multinomial regression analysis was used to identify factors that influence their perception of the performance. The results reveal significant differences in performance scores among FMGs. embers of some FMGs perceived that the participatory forest management program enabled them to get benefits from the sale of fuelwood while performance scores in the forest conservation and decision-making processes is generally poor. The score for economic performance of FMGs in turn was related to better access to roads and markets. Group size tended to enhance economic performance via its strong influence on annual fuelwood harvest, while the resource base appeared to be inconsequential. Members of the forest management groups perceived that large group size and group heterogeneity, particularly in terms of ethnicity, as well as knowledge and awareness of problems related to the forest environment. have no influence on the performance of their respective groups: For rural communities to have a favorable disposition toward sustainable forest management, differences in member understanding of collective actions and their impact before and during the implementation of participatory forest management programs should be considered.

TI  - Unfair incentives: A behavioural note on sharecropping
T2  - ECONOMICS OF TRANSITION
AB  - We conducted a laboratory-in-the-field experiment with real-life tenants in Ethiopia to test the incentive effects of fixed wage, sharecropping, fixed rent, and ownership contracts. The experimental task resembles a common process in agricultural production. The sharecropping contract is a piece rate scheme framed as a profit-sharing agreement. Sharecropping output was about 12 percent smaller than the fixed rent output. Surprisingly, it is statistically indistinguishable from the fixed wage output, despite substantial piece rates. This effect is driven by real-life sharecroppers. Their sharecropping output was smaller than that of non-sharecroppers, especially in a region where a controversial land reform took place. We argue that our subjects dislike sharecropping contracts because of the unfair profit sharing and the disputed allocation of land. Fairness concerns, therefore, may be another impediment to efficiency under the sharecropping contract.

TI  - Explaining the 'hungry farmer paradox': Smallholders and fair trade cooperatives navigate seasonality and change in Nicaragua's corn and coffee markets
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Latin American smallholder coffee farmers linked with fair trade and organic markets are frequently cited as models for sustainable food systems. Yet many experience seasonal hunger, which is a very common, but understudied, form of food insecurity. Northern Nicaragua's highlands include wellorganized cooperatives, high rural poverty rates, and rain dependent farms, offering a compelling study area to understand what factors are associated with seasonal hunger. This participatory mixed methods study combines data from observations, interviews and focus groups with results from a survey of 244 cooperative members. It finds that seasonal hunger is influenced by multiple factors, including: (1) annual cycles of precipitation and rising maize prices during the lean months; (2) inter annual droughts and periodic storms; and (3) the long-term inability of coffee harvests and prices to provide sufficient income. Sampled households experienced an average of about 3 months of seasonal hunger in 2009. A series of five least squares regression models find the expected significant impacts of corn harvest quantity, farm area, improved grain storage, and household incomes, all inversely correlated with lean months. Unanticipated results include the finding that households with more fruit trees reported fewer lean months, while the predominant environmentally friendly farming practices had no discernable impacts. The presence of hunger among producers challenges sustainable coffee marketing claims. We describe one example of a partnership-based response that integrates agroecological farm management with the use of fair trade cooperative institutions to re-localize the corn distribution system. Increased investments and integrated strategies will be needed to reduce threats to food security, livelihoods, and biodiversity associated with the rapid spread of coffee leaf rust and falling commodity prices.

TI  - The impact of a gender and business training on income hiding: An experimental study in Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - We use a randomized controlled trial and behavioral game to study the extent and determinants of income hiding in rural Vietnam. We focus on a training program that aims to promote gender equality and entrepreneurship among women in poverty who are engaged in running a small business. In one treatment arm, we allow husbands to participate in the training as well. While the impact of the training on income hiding is not significant at usual significance levels if only women are allowed to follow the training, we provide some evidence that the training invites women to hide income. Our study also suggests that allowing husbands to be present at the training intensifies this effect. We discuss several mechanisms that may explain these findings, including an increase in expected income and a decrease in information asymmetry between the spouses.

TI  - Drivers of Household Decision-Making on Land-Use Transformation: An Example of Woodlot Establishment in Masindi District, Uganda
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Land use transformation at the farm level is attributed to household decision-making, reflected by the behavior and activities of smallholder farmers. Unfortunately, household decision-making in local communities and its determinants are site-specific and hardly understood. This study uses multistage purposive selection of households as a unit for the analysis to investigate the transformation from pure agriculture to farm forest mosaics, especially through woodlot establishment. We use key informants, household surveys, and observations to obtain data on decision-making amongst 84 farm households in Nyantonzi parish, Masindi district, Uganda, as an example. Specifically, the study addresses four research questions. Firstly, what is the current status of gender-based decision-making at the household level? Secondly, is decision making within farm households individualistic or collective? Thirdly, which factors are considered to select annual, perennial and tree-crop farm management regimes? Fourthly, what determinants influence the decision-making process and the likelihood of woodlot establishment? A multilevel analysis comprising parametric statistical models and binary logistic regression is applied to assess difference in household natural, physical, human, and social capital, highlight gender roles, and obtain factors associated to selection of crops and determinants of woodlot establishment at the farm level, respectively. Results reveal that gender based decision-making is clearly disaggregated on the basis of husbands and wives and it is individualistic, mostly dominated by husbands with lower participation by wives and other family members. Households consider various factors before making any decisions, e.g., market prices for both annual and perennial crops, food consumption for annual crops, ease of management, and yields from the previous season for the tree-crop management regimes. The likelihood for woodlot establishment is positively influenced by the willingness and intention of households to establish woodlots and relative age of household head. However, knowledge of land use Policies, Laws, and Regulations (PLRs) in relation to tree planting and harvesting and access to non-farm income reduce the likelihood of woodlot establishment. Here, we recommend that current and future forest land restoration initiatives focus on reducing the gender gap and increase women's participation in decision making, provide market information platforms on wood products, and include woodlot farmers in social organization. Current PLRs on tree tenure should be improved and clearly communicated by using the existing communication assets and social gatherings as channels of change and influence for decision-making.

TI  - RESETTLEMENT AND WOODLAND MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS AND OPTIONS: A CASE STUDY FROM NORTH-WESTERN ETHIOPIA
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Deforestation in African dry forests is widespread and its drivers are complex and vary in space and time. In this paper, we assessed impacts of immigration on dry forests and options for improved management in a resettlement district in north-western Ethiopia. Key informants interviews, focus group discussions and household questionnaire survey were used to collect data. The results indicated that forests of the district are degrading in spatial coverage and quality. The most important drivers were land use change, excessive wood harvest, grazing pressure and forest fire following immigration. The continuous influx of people with different origins, cultures, religions and lengths of residence in the district underscores absence of social bonds for collective action to regulate access. This, coupled with weak formal regulatory system, market forces and policy incentives for farming, resulted in a near open access situation. Our findings confirm the negative relationships between migration and environment not necessarily because of the mere population number added through immigration but because of lack of regulatory frameworks (formal or informal) and poor social capital. Enforcing existing policy of farm size and putting institutional framework on the ground to regulate rate of immigration, extraction of forest products and to encourage tree planting to meet wood demand are suggested measures. We conclude that Government programmes that opt for resettlement as a measure for poverty alleviation must also have mitigating measures to reducing negative impacts on the natural resource base. Thus, the trade-off between environment and development must be carefully managed. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Vegetable Business and Smallholders' Food Security: Empirical Findings from Northern Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In Ethiopia, there have been increased efforts to promote market-oriented vegetable production. Given that food security is a crucial issue in Ethiopia, the question is whether market-oriented vegetable production will actually help farmers to become more food secure. Using a mixed methods approach, the present research gathered empirical evidence on the determinants of participation in the vegetable business and its food security impacts in the Raya Azebo district. The Heckman two-stage selection model was used to identify factors affecting participation in the vegetable business and its effects on several food security outcomes. A thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative data. The results show that a farmer's participation in the vegetable business increased significantly with adequate household productive resources (e.g., land size and access to irrigation), cooperative memberships and access to extension services. On the other hand, the age of the head of household, the market distance and risk perceptions significantly decreased participation. Additionally, the results indicate participation in the vegetable business results not only in higher food availability and access but also in lower food variety and diet diversity scores. Participation has less of an impact on per capita kilocalorie consumption and child anthropometric measures of food security. The policy implication is that, while Ethiopia is going ahead with inclusive market-driven approaches to food security, alternative mechanisms must be put in place to address the negative impacts and to empower those living in the most vulnerable conditions.

TI  - Does Land Tenure Systems Affect Sustainable Agricultural Development?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The current study aims to investigate the agricultural investment differences among three kinds of land lease agreements and their effect on farmers' decisions regarding sustainable growth in terms of soil conservation and wheat productivity, using cross-sectional data from rural households in Punjab, Pakistan. The multivariate Tobit model was used for the empirical analysis because it considers the possible substitution of investment choices and the tenancy status' endogeneity. Compared to agricultural lands on lease contracts, landowners involved in agribusiness are more likely to invest in measures to improve soil and increase productivity. Moreover, the present study has also identified that the yield per hectare is much higher for landowners than sharecroppers, and thus, the Marshall's assumption of low efficiency of tenants under sharecroppers is supported.

TI  - Addressing food insecurity in Richmond area of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: The role of cash transfers
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB  - Food insecurity is one of the national priorities in South Africa. Cash transfer programs are hypothesized to alleviate short-term deprivations, regularize consumption, and reduce the adoption of negative coping strategies. This study estimates the role play of cash transfers in enhancing food security in South Africa. The household food security access scale (HFIAS) was used to estimate food security status of 180 sampled households. An endogenous switching poisson model was used to examine how household food insecurity was affected by access to cash transfers. The findings indicate that the household food security was statistically significantly influenced by access to cash transfers, household head gender, access to finance, access to farm-based organizations (FBO), access to cooperatives, and agricultural training. As a result, this study recommends the South African government and other donor organizations to expand cash transfer programs among low-income households in rural South Africa. Access to cash transfers is a key component of achieving enhanced household food security.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of African Institute of Mathematical Sciences / Next Einstein Initiative.

TI  - Impact of smallholder farmers' climate-smart adaptation practices on wheat yield in southern Ethiopia
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study explored factors that determine smallholder farmers' climate change adaptation practices and their impact on wheat yield in the Lemo district of southern Ethiopia. Focus group discussions and stakeholder consultations were used to supplement survey data collected from 537 wheat smallholder producers. We performed an impact evaluation analysis by combining endogenous switching regression (ESR) with propensity score matching (PSM) model to address the issue of unobserved biases. The study indicates that gender, farmers' education level, farming experience, cooperative membership, access to extension services, and weather information were significant determinants of smallholder household decisions for climate change adaptation practices. Both ESR and PSM models revealed that smallholder farmers' adaptation practices significantly enhanced wheat yield by 34.35%. This implies that climate-smart practices adopted by smallholder farmers are vital for improving and sustaining wheat yield. Thus, our findings suggest that policy actions should consider existing smallholder farmers' knowledge and practices in policy actions aimed at mitigating climate change impacts to sustain agricultural productivity.

TI  - Rangelands of Central Asia: challenges and opportunities
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
AB  - Rangelands of Central Asia (referring to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in this study), the largest contiguous area of grazed land in the world, serve as an important source of livelihood for pastoral and agro-pastoral communities in this region. They also play an important role in absorbing CO2 as a global carbon sink. However, unsustainable management of rangelands has led to their degradation hugely by downgrading their potential agro-ecological, environmental and socio-economical roles. This paper reviewed the rangeland degradation in Central Asia, a topic which so far has received only scant coverage in the international scientific literature. It also provided examples of successful experiences and outlined possible options that land managers can adopt to enhance the sustainable management of these vast degraded rangelands. The experiences and lessons described in this paper may also be relevant for other degraded rangeland areas, especially in the developing countries. The causes of rangeland degradation within the Central Asian region are numerous, complex and inter-related. Therefore, while addressing the factors associated with improper rangeland management may shed some light on the causes of rangeland degradation, the scope of this paper would not be all-encompassing for the major causes of degradation. There is a need to develop and widely apply the viable and locally accepted and adapted packages of technical, institutional and policy options for sustainable rangeland management. Incentivizing the collective action of small-scale pastoralists who group together to facilitate access to remote pastures can reduce the degree of overgrazing within community pastures, such as those near the settlements. We also found that migratory grazing through pooling of resources among small-scale pastoralists can increase household income. After their independence, most Central Asian countries adopted various rangeland tenure arrangements. However, the building of enhanced capacities of pasture management and effective local rangeland governance structures can increase the likelihood, which will be sustainable and equitable. Finally, this paper presented several promising technical options, aiming at reversing the trend of rangeland degradation in Central Asia.

TI  - Reaching the rural poor through rural producer organizations? A study of agricultural marketing cooperatives in Ethiopia
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - This paper examines the notion of inclusiveness in rural producer organizations (RPOs) and the extent to which such RPCs can be used to reach the rural poor in sub-Saharan Africa. Using farmer cooperatives in Ethiopia as a case in point, the paper examines the role of RPOs in supporting smallholder commercialization, and the extent to which principles of an inclusive, bottom-up approach relate to their marketing performance. Based on a combination of nationally-representative household- and cooperative-level survey data, we find that poorer farmers tend not to participate in these organizations although they may indirectly benefit from them. When they do participate, they are often excluded from decision-making processes. Finally, we investigate the relationship between marketing performance and inclusiveness and uncover evidence of significant tradeoffs between them. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Impact of a Local Development Project on Social Capital: Evidence from the Bohol Irrigation Scheme in the Philippines
T2  - WATER
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the connection between local development projects and the residents' social capital in Bohol, The Philippines. From this perspective, we hypothesized that social behaviors of local farmers are influenced by the availability of canal irrigation due to the collective water management required in irrigated societies. By combining the results of the ultimatum game (UG) with a household survey on 245 villagers in Bohol, this paper (1) measures the degree of social capital at the individual level and (2) quantifies the effects of irrigation on social capital by controlling household as well as individual characteristics. Moreover, we employed a Spatial Autoregressive model to explore the spatial effects and social contexts of farmers' behavioral patterns. The empirical results show that the level of measured social behavior is strongly associated with access to community irrigation water and asset holdings. Additionally, increased physical distance between residents leads to a decrease in social capital, or interdependency, among them. The results suggest that community engagement (e.g., irrigation management committee and turnout service association) with local development projects would not only improve agricultural productivity but also enhance social relationships among farmers, highlighting its importance.

TI  - The Influence of Social Networking on Food Security Status of Cassava Farming Households in Nigeria
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Food security, at national and household levels, is on the decline because traditional capital (physical, natural, human and financial) has not fully led to its improvement. There is an increasing shift of attention to social capital as an element that explains household food security, but there is a lack of adequately documented information on this. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of social capital on food security, using data collected on a cross-section of 775 cassava farming households from four zones of Nigeria. About 58% of the respondents (cassava farming households) fall under the intermediate category in terms of the benefits received from belonging in social groups. Age and educational level increased the probability to receive benefit from group activities (p< 0.05), while membership density, labor contribution and decision making significantly affected the level of benefit received (p< 0.10). Based on the estimated food security line, 41% of the cassava households were food secure, while 59% were food insecure. Membership density, cash and labor contribution significantly affected food security. Membership density (p< 0.10) and cash contribution (p< 0.05) increased the probability of being food secure. It was recommended that cassava farming households should be encouraged or aided to form cooperatives or farmers' groups, participate in the activities, and make financial contributions to investments that reduce manual labor-input in the farming activities to enhance household food security.

TI  - Livelihoods and Food Security Among Rural Households in the North-Western Mount Kenya Region
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Food insecurity remains a major concern for numerous rural households in Sub-Saharan Africa who rely on agriculture as their main source of livelihood. The assessment of the links between food security and livelihoods is central for overcoming widespread food insecurity. However, assessments remain challenging due to food security's multi-dimensionality and the challenge of finding indicators that are comparable and applicable to various contexts. This study addresses this challenge by adapting a food security index (FSI) and uses it to assess the livelihood drivers of food security. The index captures the multi-dimensionality of food security using conventional food security indicators. The assessed indicators include measures of "food consumption score," "household dietary diversity score," "coping strategies index," the "household food insecurity access scale," and "months of adequate household food provisioning." The study covered 600 randomly selected households representative of three agro-ecological zones located close to large-scale agricultural investment in Mount Kenya region in Kenya. We used linear regression to identify livelihood factors significantly influencing food security. Spearman's rank-order correlation and student's T-test demonstrated a strong and significant correlation between the composite FSI index and each classical indicators of food security. Overall, 32% of the households were food secure and 68% were food insecure. Households' ownership of productive hand tools, followed by off-farm income, consumption of own produced food, type of agro-ecological zone, farm income and number of main crops infested by pests had a significant effect on household food security. All these factors, except the number of main crops infested by pests, were found to positively influence household food security. Households in humid agro-ecological zone were less food secure than households in semi-humid and semi-arid zones. Household size, the size of accessible land and households' members' participation to large agricultural investments (as wage workers or sub-contract farmer) were not significantly influencing food security. Households of the Mount Kenya region need alternative off-farm income sources combined with further support to improve sustainable agriculture management with appropriate hand tools.

TI  - A framework to investigate drivers of adaptation decisions in marine fishing: Evidence from urban, semi-urban and rural communities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Traditional fishing livelihoods need to adapt to changing fish catch/populations, led by numerous anthropogenic, environmental and climatic stressors. The decision to adapt can be influenced by a variety of socio-economic and perceptual factors. However, adaptation decision-making in fishing communities has rarely been studied. Based on previous literature and focus group discussions with community, this study identifies few prominent adaptation responses inmarine fishing and proposes credible factors driving decisions to adopt them. Further, a household survey is conducted, and the association of these drivers with various adaptation strategies is examined among fisherfolk of Maharashtra (India). This statistical analysis is based on 601 responses collected across three regional fishing groups: urban, semi-urban and rural. Regional segregation is done to understand variability in decision-making among groups which might be having different socio-economic and perceptual attributes. The survey reveals that only few urban fishing households have been able to diversify into other livelihoods. While having economic capital increases the likelihood of adaptation among urban and semi-urban communities, rural fishermen are significantly driven by social capital. Perception of climate change affecting fish catch drives adoption of mechanized boats solely in urban region. But increasing number of extreme events affects decisions of semi-urban and rural fishermen. Further, rising pollution and trade competition is associated with adaptation responses in the urban and semi-urban community. Higher education might help fishermen choose convenient forms of adaptation. Also, cooperative membership and subsidies are critical in adaptation decisions. The framework and insights of the study suggest the importance of acknowledging differential decision-making of individuals and communities, for designing effective adaptation and capacity-building policies.

TI  - Which type of producer organization is (more) inclusive? Dynamics of farmers' membership and participation in the decision-making process
T2  - ANNALS OF PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - Producer organizations (POs) provide benefits to smallholders by alleviating market access challenges. However, whether all farmers benefit from a PO is still a question. Limited evidence is available on whether POs are inclusive of poor farmers. Even if the poor join, do they participate in decision-making? We conducted interviews with 595 smallholder dairy farmers in Kenya. We distinguish three groups; members of a bargaining PO, members of a processing PO and non-members. We show that membership is related to the structural characteristics of the organization: processing POs favor membership of farmers that are wealthier, more educated and more innovative. As to participation in the decision-making process: older, male and specialized farmers have a higher chance of being involved than poor farmers. Factors distinguishing farmer participation in decision-making between bargaining and processing POs are highlighted. We find that a bargaining PO is more inclusive of all groups of farmers, while women and poor farmers are excluded from decision-making in a processing PO. Our findings contribute to policymaking on inclusive development.

TI  - Effects of Fairtrade on the livelihoods of poor rural workers
T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Workers in rural areas in developing countries often face precarious working conditions, low wages and poverty. Sustainability standards-such as Fairtrade-could potentially improve the situation. Although many studies have analysed the impact of Fairtrade on smallholder farmers, few focus on wage workers beyond those employed by large companies despite most workers being employed by small farms and cooperatives. We analyse the effect of Fairtrade on workers' wages and working conditions in the small farm sector. We conducted a survey among workers in the cocoa sector in Cote d'Ivoire and their employers, distinguishing between farm workers and cooperative workers. Fairtrade improves wages and reduces poverty among cooperative workers, but not among farm workers, even though the latter are particularly deprived. At the cooperative level, labour standards are regularly monitored by Fairtrade. Certification also helps cooperatives increase the services offered to their members, which leads to more and better-paid employment at the cooperative level. At the farm level, inspections of labour standards are more costly, difficult and rare. Thus, Fairtrade hardly affects traditional employment modalities at the farm level even when farmers themselves benefit from certification. Ensuring that labour standards are met at all levels may require innovative and more efficient monitoring approaches.

TI  - Impact of contracts in high yielding varieties seed production on profits and yield: The case of Nepal
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Nepal's population continues to grow, but the agricultural sector's performance remains almost stagnant. This has led to a decline in the per capita availability of food. Increasing agricultural productivity is the key to agricultural growth, and one strategy for increasing agricultural productivity is to use improved seeds. This study investigates the impact of contract farming (CF) in high yielding varieties (HYV) of paddy seed production on costs, yield, and profits of smallholder farms in Nepal. Using farm-level data and a non-parametric propensity score matching estimator, the study finds a significant positive impact of contract HYV seed farming on revenues, profits, and yield, and a significant negative impact on total costs of production. Additionally, very small farms (<= 0.43 ha) with CF in HYV paddy seeds tend to gain the most when it comes to yield per hectare. Our estimates reveal that the average smallholder household in Nepal engaged in CF with input conditions receives higher profits. However, farmers engaged in CF with output conditions tend to have higher yields but smaller profits. Finally, farmers engaged in CF in HYV paddy seeds with both input and output conditions have the highest yield gains and significantly higher profits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Access to water in the countries of the former Soviet Union
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: During the Soviet period, authorities in the USSR invested heavily in collective farming and modernization of living conditions in rural areas. However, many problems remained, including poor access to many basic amenities such as water. Since then, the situation is likely to have changed; economic decline has coincided with migration and widening social inequalities, potentially increasing disparities within and between countries.
   Aim: To examine access to water and sanitation and its determinants in urban and rural areas of eight former Soviet countries.
   Methods: A series of nationally representative surveys in Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Ukraine was undertaken in 2001, covering 18,428 individuals (aged 18+ years).
   Results: The percentage of respondents Living in rural areas varied between 27 and 59% among countries. There are wide urban-rural differences in access to amenities. Even in urban areas, only about 90% of respondents had access to cold running water in their home (60% in Kyrgyzstan). In rural areas, less than one-third had cold running water in their homes (44% in Russia, under 10% in Kyrgyzstan and Moldova). Between one-third and one-half of rural respondents in some countries (such as Belarus, Kazakhstan and Moldova) obtained their water from welts and similar sources. Access to hot running water inside the homes was an exception in rural households, reflecting the tack of modern heating methods in villages. Similarly, indoor access to toilets is common in urban areas but rare in rural areas. Access to all amenities was better in Russia compared with elsewhere in the region. Indoor access to cold water was significantly more common among rural residents Living in apartments, and in settlements served by asphalt roads rather than dirt roads. People with more assets or income and living with other people were significantly more likely to have water on tap. In addition, people who had moved in more recently were more likely to have an indoor water supply.
   Conclusions: This was the largest single study of its kind undertaken in this region, and demonstrates that a significant number of people living in rural parts of the former Soviet Union do not have indoor access to running water and sanitation. There are significant variations among countries, with the worse situation in central Asia and the Caucasus, and the best situation in Russia. Access to water strongly correlates with socio-economic characteristics. These findings suggest a need for sustained investment in rebuilding basic infrastructure in the region, and monitoring the impact of living conditions on health.

TI  - Which smallholder farmers benefit most from biomass production for food and biofuel? The case of Gondola district, central Mozambique
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB  - We analysed the influence of the mode of participation in biomass production for biofuels on food security of different farm types. We studied two modes of participation in biomass production: an outgrower scheme for sunflower and a jatropha plantation offering full time employment and assessed the four dimensions of food security: availability, access, stability and utilization in smallholder farms in Central Mozambique. We interviewed 80 households who were participating in the sunflower outgrower scheme, had a household member working on the jatropha plantation or were not participating with biofuel production. For each household we quantified four indicators: maize sales minus purchases, gross revenue, revenue diversity, and household dietary diversity scores. Involvement of smallholder farmers with biomass production for fuel had a positive or no impact on the four dimensions of food security at the farm level. Positive food security impacts from working on the biofuel plantation were improvements in availability for the larger farms and improvements in access for the smaller farms. Utilization of food was generally not impacted. Impacts on food security from the sunflower outgrower scheme were minor. There is scope to improve the outgrower scheme with services and inputs that increase sunflower yields and give positive spill-overs to other crops. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Climate Change Adaptation, Food Security, and Attitudes toward Risk among Smallholder Coffee Farmers in Nicaragua
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Farmers' livelihoods are uniquely vulnerable to climate change, and taking adaptive measures to changing environmental conditions constitutes one of the most important pathways for protecting them. Their willingness and capacity to adopt improved practices and technologies, their cognitive and behavioural preferences, and the institutional response mechanisms will go a long way in determining their success in their adaptation to climate change. This study presents results of an analysis of the vulnerabilities of smallholder coffee producers in Nicaragua to climate change. I use descriptive analyses and experimental risk games to evaluate the preferences and attitudes of coffee producers in the context of their adaptation to climate change. I show that food insecure households are more risk-averse than food-secure households and that much work is needed in the sector to ensure equity and improve institutional capacity. For households in chronic poverty, conventional risk management strategies simply may not be enough. Institutional arrangements must be put in place to enable coffee-growing households to engage in practices that result in improved capacity for climate change adaptation.

TI  - Negotiating new institutional logics Market access amongst smallholder farmers in Zambia and Malawi
T2  - SOCIETY AND BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to analyse how processes of institutional change in environments of institutional 'voids' affect smallholder farmer market access in Zambia and Malawi, and explores the role of different dis/enabling institutional agents and logics. The authors examine this in the context of two divergent routes of institutional change - one externally imposed and the second driven from within the ecosystem itself. The authors consider how these different institutional processes impact upon smallholder farmers and how they are able to adapt to these changes. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research approach is used which lends itself to an analysis of multiple institutional logics that is based upon the multiple positions of market actors. It uses a comparative case study design methodology focused on two broad cases of smallholder farmers in Zambia and Malawi. Findings The research demonstrates the tension that multiple institutional logics can create especially amongst those most vulnerable particularly where these are not embedded in local realities and mindful of social settings. Originality/value It contributes to the understanding of poverty alleviation in rural developing regions, on overcoming institutional voids, market inclusivity and the role of social entrepreneurs and intermediaries, and builds on the perspective of markets as social spaces for economic exchange.

TI  - Factors affecting marketing channel choice decisions of smallholder Citrus growers
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose Despite the fact that citrus industry is growing in Pakistan where production is dominated by small-scale citrus growers, no research has been done to evaluate and analyse the marketing channel choice decision-making process of these citrus growers. The purpose of this paper is to review the existing factors affecting decision making of small-size citrus growers in citrus supply chain in Pakistan and also measures and analyses the factors that affect the marketing channel decisions of these small size growers.
   Design/methodology/approach A multivariate decision analysis technique, conjoint analysis, was used to analyse and evaluate the major factors affecting marketing channel choice decisions of small-size citrus growers.
   Findings It was concluded that among nine very important factors, six factors played a major role in the marketing channel choice decision making. Only three factors namely, price, time of complete fruit picking and number of fruit pickings were considered highly important factors and reflected that citrus growers not only want to secure his payments but also to save their orchards for next season(s).
   Research limitations/implications The research would provide valuable information about citrus grower's marketing decision-making process and thus would contribute to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of citrus industry in Pakistan.
   Originality/value This analysis would suggest them to make rational decisions and help choosing them the most appropriate combination of different levels of different factors which would increase their profits. This study identifies the most relevant factors and their levels which citrus growers and pre-harvest contractors preferred in citrus marketing channel choice decision making, thus, server as a guideline for the buyer's to deal with them accordingly. This would improve the efficiency and reduce the transaction cost along the citrus supply chain in Pakistan.

TI  - Supporting Brazilian smallholder farmers decision making in supplying institutional markets
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB  - Smallholder farmers are amongst the most vulnerable communities in developing countries, lacking a stable income due to inconsistent access to markets. Aiming to tackle rural poverty, the Brazilian govern-ment established institutional markets for smallholder farmers to supply their produce to schools through a non-competitive bidding mechanism. However, participation of farmers is still limited due to the chal-lenging decision-making process.
   Aspiring to contribute towards increasing their participation, this study aims to support farmers into two key decisions they face during sequential stages of the bidding process, namely whether to bid for each available school and product combination and whether subsequently to accept the awarded bids once the bids' outcome is known. A decision support system, based on two sequential MILP optimisation models, was developed and applied to the case study of Canudos settlement, guiding farmers on the optimal bidding and contract acceptance strategy.
   This study contributes to the decision support systems field by applying OR methods to a real-life problem within a new context. It is the first application of an OR-based decision support system in the non-competitive bid/no-bid literature, defining an optimal bidding strategy through the application of optimisation methods to maximise profitability while removing subjectivity from the decision-making process. Moreover, it is the first decision support system within the bid/no-bid decision-making field being applied to the agricultural and institutional market context. The proposed approach could have a significant social impact for smallholder farmers in Brazil, improving their living conditions by providing security of income and strengthening inclusive agricultural growth.

TI  - Impacts of market-oriented agroforestry on farm income and food security: insights from Kavre and Lamjung districts of Nepal
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing realization that improving market access for smallholders will lead to improvement in income and food security. However, market failure often limit smallholders' fair access to market opportunities. To address this problem, a market-oriented agroforestry action research program was implemented in six sites of Kavre and Lamjung districts of Nepal between 2013 and 2016. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the changing impacts of the market-oriented agroforestry system on improving people's livelihoods and addressing food security issues. The net-margin analysis of five priority products of agroforestry systems indicated that farmers benefitted most by a banana-based high yielding fodder system (56%) followed by Alnus-cardamom system (48%), tomato-fodder and buffalo (36%), chilli-fodder (26%) and ginger-based (25%) systems due to facilitation of market-oriented agroforestry action research services. The impact of market-oriented agroforestry intervention from a survey of 289 households, revealed that household income was increased by 37-48%, which can provide up to six additional months of food to the poorest households. This innovation has the potential to take the majority of households (63%) out of the poverty cycle while avoiding food shortage during the year. The implications of the study are that farmers must be united for collective marketing of their production and develop marketing strategies to eliminate middle men for better return. Some key lessons learned for the success of this research include farmers' own motivation, favorable environment, and the inclusion of social activities and incentives for cultivating priority products species.

TI  - Women and collective action: lessons from the Indian dairy cooperative sector
T2  - COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL
AB  - This article scrutinizes key effects of women's empowerment through cooperative membership. Since the 1980s, over 3000 women-only dairy cooperative societies have been founded in Karnataka, India, with the objective of economically and socially empowering women. First we review the broader literature on gender and collective action in a development context and then empirically assess empowerment levels among fifty-eight female dairy farmers in Karnataka. We discriminate between membership and non-membership status in women-only versus mixed-gender dairy cooperatives and compare empowerment levels among those groups, borrowing categories from the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index. We find that, in a context of rural poverty in which women-only cooperatives are promoted without offering additional development opportunities for men, the empowering effects remain limited to increased leadership abilities. Cooperative membership as such does not automatically enhance women's control over income or their intrahousehold decision-making power. In fact, members of women-only cooperatives perceive themselves as having even less control over dairy income and productive decisions compared with unorganized female dairy producers. These findings suggest that collective organizations in the dairy sector which systematically exclude men may fail to increase women's empowerment at the household level. At the same time, women face entry barriers to participation in mixed-gender cooperatives. We conclude that policies in support of women-only cooperatives and female members in mixed-gender cooperatives may require more rigorous evaluation.

TI  - To inhabit, retain or abandon? Adaptive utilization of energy-efficient sunken buildings by rural households in Shanzhou, China
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Vernacular architecture has been widely concerned in recent years because of its energy-efficient and environmental adaptability characteristics, and is considered as a potential method to reduce rural energy consumption and an important cultural heritage. However, under the rural modernization and urbanization, vernacular architecture is in danger of disappearing. This paper focuses on the sunken courtyard, a typical vernacular architecture that utilizes underground space, carries out field investiga-tion and questionnaire survey in villages of Shanzhou District, China. It is found that local residents adopt a variety of spatial utilization modes for sunken courtyards, and the structural equation model is further applied to analyse the decision-making process of farmers. The result is as follows: First, the utilization of sunken courtyards still reduces the household energy consumption; Second, policy guidance (weight coefficient is 0.57) and objective building conditions (weight coefficient is 0.25) are the main factors that affect farmers' decision-making; Third, village collective and individual decisions affect the energy con-sumption level of the whole village system. Finally, the formulation of rural development policies should fully consider the relationship between residents, buildings and village systems, so as to form unique local solutions. This study provides insights for the development of future architectural heritage conser-vation and rural renewal strategies. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Price policy, poverty, and power within rural West African households
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - This paper explores the impact of agricultural price policy on poverty in West Africa, a region in which prices are an important tool for raising rural household incomes. A game-theoretic, collective model of household income generation and resource allocation is developed that incorporates three features typical of West African rural households: preference heterogeneity among women and men, individual resource control, and power-mediated bargaining over resource control in the face of changes in households' economic environments. To explore price effects, the model is used to simulate the income impacts of large increases in cotton prices accompanying fast-paced agricultural liberalisation in Burkina Faso in the 1980s. The paper shows that where resources are controlled individually by household members, rather than pooled, Pareto efficiency in income generation does not hold. The impact of agricultural price policy on poverty is mediated by bargaining over resource control within households. Both the relative bargaining power of women and men and the degree of preference heterogeneity between them play fundamental roles in the outcome of such bargaining. The results point to a lower ability of households to take advantage of price incentives and thereby raise their incomes than a unitary household model, in which preferences do not differ and resources are pooled, predicts. They suggest that the effectiveness of price policy in reducing poverty in the region would be enhanced by taking into account the incentive structure within households as well as individual household members' ability to bargain over the benefit and cost streams flowing from price changes.

TI  - The interaction of household agricultural landholding andCasteon food security in rural Uttar Pradesh, India
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Recent studies on the agriculture- nutrition disconnect and its implications for farming systems, especially in South Asia have revived the debate surrounding the relationship of food security to household agricultural landholding (HAL). In rural India, food security, HAL, and social hierarchy (Caste) are closely connected. However, lack of empirical research on their interlinkages creates a knowledge gap that limits the formulation of evidence-based policies. In this study, we use data from a unique survey of 5087 rural households in Uttar Pradesh (UP) state in India to empirically assess the links betweenCaste,HAL, and food security. Our analysis finds that, both independently and collectively,Casteand agricultural landholding have a significant bearing on household food insecurity levels. 94% of all food-insecure households report to hold no HAL or are holding marginal HAL. The predicted probability of food insecurity for households with no HAL is four times higher compared to medium-to-large HAL. MarginalisedCastes(e.g. Hindu and Muslim Dalits) have three-to-four time higher chance of food insecurity compared to their counterparts. The interaction effects ofCaste-HAL suggest that marginalisedCasteswith no landholding are the most vulnerable groups for food insecurity. Thus, we suggest considering the role ofCasteand HAL based inequalities and their interaction effect in policies adopted by the state for ensuring accessibility and availability of food among households in rural UP.

TI  - Impact of tissue culture banana technology on farm household income and food security in Kenya
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - While tissue culture (TC) technology for vegetative plant propagation is gradually gaining in importance in Africa, rigorous assessment of broader welfare effects for adopting smallholder farm households is lacking. Using survey data and accounting for selection bias in technology adoption, we analyze the impact of TC banana technology on household income and food security in Kenya. To assess food security outcomes, we employ the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) - a tool that has not been used for impact assessment before. Estimates of treatment-effects models show that TC banana adoption, combined with improved crop management, causes considerable increases in farm and household income. Technology adoption also reduces relative food insecurity in a significant way. These results indicate that TC technology can be welfare enhancing for adopting farm households. Adoption should be further promoted through upscaling appropriate technology delivery systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Community transformation through certified organic cotton initiatives-an analysis of case studies in Peru, Tanzania and India
T2  - RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - This paper examines how certified organic cotton initiatives (COCIs) influence community capitals in rural Peru, Tanzania and India using the community capitals framework (CCF). Case study analyses, including qualitative interviews of farmers, expert interviews and participatory observations, were conducted in Northern Peru, Northern Tanzania and Eastern India. The results show slight changes in community capitals in Peru, while comprehensive changes and spiraling-up effects were triggered by certified organic cotton farming initiatives in Tanzania and India. These community developments strongly depended on set measures, such as the extent of (1) partnership (e.g., contract farming), (2) input support (e.g., seeds, loans, community infrastructure), (3) capacity building (through training and advisory services), (4) group formation and (5) formation of cooperatives. Favorable environmental conditions and supporting local institutions facilitated spiraling-up effects, while social preconditions (e.g., gender inequality) strongly limited these effects. The research showed that COCIs have considerable potential to trigger spiraling-up effects in rural communities. However, the capacity strongly depends on the respective initiative and its ability to involve and empower farmers, i.e., to build up human and social capital.

TI  - Impact of membership in frankincense cooperative firms on rural income and poverty in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Rural households in northern Ethiopia had no access to frankincense production and trading. However, following the recent devolution of forest use-rights, rural communities in norther Ethiopia are getting access through organizing frankincense cooperatives. This study examines the effects of membership in the rural frankincense firms on income and poverty by applying instrumental variable, propensity score matching and Rosenbaum bounds methods on survey data from five rural villages in frankincense woodland areas of Northern Ethiopia. Results indicate that both membership and amount of households' investment in shares in the frankincense cooperative firms have statistically significant positive welfare impacts. The average treatment effect on the treated from matching methods for the welfare indicator variables (log-transformed household per adult equivalent income, poverty head count, poverty gap, and poverty severity) are robust against hidden bias arising from unobserved confounding variables that simultaneously affect assignment into frankincense forest cooperative firm membership and each of the welfare indicator variables.

TI  - Smallholder decision-making process in technology adoption intention: implications for Dipterocarpus alatus in Northeastern Thailand
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Coupled with newly introduced technology, sustainable agriculture is considered a cooperative strategy for lowincome countries to improve farm productivity and economic growth. This study focuses on analyzing the process of adoption intention with a new technology associated with the use of Dipterocarpus alatus, a large tree species restricted to Thailand. A conceptual framework of the technology acceptance model (TAM) has been applied to explain farmers' decision-making processes. The purposive sampling approach targets farmers in the area who have D. alatus trees on their properties. Structural equation models, latent variables, and the hypothesized adoption intention interactions are the primary tools used in analyzing the decision-making process. Results showed that adoption intention concerning D. alatus technology was significantly influenced by perceived ease of use and attitudes based on experience and environmental sensibilities. This study has extended the application of TAM, providing insight into decision-making processes that are not hindered by technology implementation.

TI  - Amazon entrepreneurs: Women's economic empowerment and the potential for more sustainable land use practices
T2  - WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM
AB  - This study focuses on the effects on rural women's empowerment of participation in collective microenterprises: access and decision-making power for land use, as well as on changes in their resource management practices. We explore a very specific effect of women's empowerment on efforts to implement more sustainable livelihood practices by women participating in collective microenterprise activities. The study used a qualitative research design, carrying out semi-structured interviews with 65 rural women participants of eleven collective microenterprises in the Amazonian states of Para and Acre, Brazil. The results showed that women's economic empowerment contributed to their strengthened capacity for adaptive governance in the household due to improvements in their awareness of environmental issues and practices used to manage forest resources; and greater access to resources and to decision-making power about land use.

TI  - Large-Scale Agricultural Investments and Smallholder Welfare: A Comparison of Wage Labor and Outgrower Channels in Tanzania
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This article evaluates household welfare effects of large-scale agricultural investments in Tanzania, one of the main recipients of such investments in Africa. Specifically, the article compares households participating in sugar and rice investments through out grower schemes or as agro-industry workers with non-participants in terms of household income and income poverty. Building on primary household data, it is one of the first studies to empirically analyze ex-post impacts of large-scale agricultural investments in Africa. The analysis draws on cross-section survey data of 516 households collected in Kilombero District, a priority cluster for the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT). The results show overall positive household welfare differences between participants of the investments and the respective counterfactual. However, there are large differences between arrangements and subsectors. Estimated effects for outgrowers are largest, yet for land-rich outgrowers more so than for land-poor. Effects for agro-industry workers in the sugar investment are significantly larger than for those in the rice investment, though in both investments land-poor workers seem to benefit. Hence, the study results suggest potential benefits of outgrower schemes and potentials of agro-industry wage employment for the land-poor to escape extreme poverty. Yet, it also stresses particularly the need to address the constraints of land-poor outgrowers. Qualitative interviews, for example, pointed to growing risks for land-poor outgrowers in the context of rising elite capture by larger outgrowers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Land ownership and technology adoption revisited: Improved maize varieties in Ethiopia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The lack of land ownership can discourage agricultural technology adoption, yet there is scarce evidence of the impact of land rental contracts on the adoption of improved crop varieties in developing countries. The current study investigates such impact using a nationally representative survey of Ethiopian maize farmers. In contrast to many previous studies, we show in a simple model that cash-renters are as likely to adopt improved maize varieties as owner-operators, while sharecroppers are more likely to adopt given that such varieties are profitable. Empirical analysis reveals a significant impact of sharecropping on improved maize variety adoption, and no significant impact from cash-rental, lending support to the above hypotheses. These results imply that improvements in land rental markets can potentially enhance household welfare through crop variety adoption in agrarian economies where land sales markets are incomplete or missing.

TI  - Impact of rainfall pattern on cereal market and food security in Sudan: Stochastic approach and CGE model
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - The paper aims at analysing the impact of the likely change in rainfall on food availability and access to food in Sudan. The empirical investigation is based on an integrated approach consisting of a stochastic method and CGE model. The former, related to the Monte Carlo analysis, provides the likely changes in rainfall patterns and their probability of occurrence based on historical data. These results are at the basis of the scenarios simulated in a standard CGE model augmented with a stochastic component. Achievements underline the negative impact on the two dimensions of food security taken into consideration, mainly due to a reduction in cereal supply, a marked cereal inflation pressure and income contraction; the greater negative effect on the poorest households; and a deterioration of the economic performance of the country. In this context, the paper stresses a strong interconnection among climate change and variability, poverty and food insecurity and thus the need for an integrated policy-making approach.

TI  - Do farmer groups improve the situation of women in agriculture in rural Kenya?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Production by smallholders in rural Kenya is limited by institutional, technical and investment constraints. Female farmers are the majority among smallholders and have significant roles in agriculture; nonetheless, they face constraints in accessing resources. Recent primary data of 347 farmers ( proportional random sampling) was used to examine: ( a) factors affecting women's participation in agriculture; (b) factors influencing female farmers' decision to join a farmer group; and (c) the effect of women's membership in a farmer group on crop yield. We applied Probit and linear regression with endogenous treatment maximum likelihood methods. Results reveal that women's participation is positively influenced by membership in a farmer group and land ownership. Women's decision to join a farmer group is positively affected by access to credit, and negatively by limited decision-making power and lack of access to land. Crop yield is positively affected by membership years in a farmer group and ownership of mobile phones, negatively by lack of credit. Farmer groups are a particularly effective platform to improve crop yields and other constraints confronting female farmers. Surprisingly, this platform is under-utilised. Policymakers should invest in human, financial and physical capital of farmer groups as a pathway to rural development, improved rural livelihoods and reduced poverty.

TI  - Innovation platform for improving rice marketing decisions among smallholder farmers in Homa-Bay County, Kenya
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - Smallholder farmers are normally faced with making a decision on market participation and consequently choosing the appropriate marketing channel for their agricultural produce. This study focuses on how a multi-stakeholder innovation platform approach for improving the uptake of System of Rice Intensification and rice productivity influences marketing decisions among smallholder rice farmers. The study relies on primary data collected from 102 households in Homa-Bay County, Kenya. Logistic and multinomial logistic regression models were used in the analysis. The practice of system of rice intensification, membership to farmer groups, frequency of access to extension services, distance to the nearest market and access to transportation facilities were important determinants to market participation among farmers. A farmers' choice of marketing channel was commonly influenced by size of land under rice cultivation, access to transport facilities and whether rice was to be sold collectively or individually. We therefore conclude that the multi-stakeholder innovation platform approach improves decision making in marketing. We thus recommend that governments embrace multi-stakeholder Innovation Platforms as a framework for improving farmer participation in rice markets and improving decision making when approaching available markets.

TI  - Impacts of climate-smart crop varieties and livestock breeds on the food security of smallholder farmers in Kenya
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - This paper analyses the impact of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) technologies on household dietary diversity and food insufficiency as indicators of food and nutrition security in Kenya. Using a combination of Propensity Score Matching and endogenous treatment effect approaches, we found that adoption of stress-tolerant varieties of several crops (such as bean, pigeon pea, cowpea, maize and sorghum) improved household dietary diversity score by 40% and reduced food insufficiency by 75%. Adoption of improved and resilient livestock breeds (including Red Maasai sheep and Galla goats) improved household dietary diversity by 38% while reducing household food insufficiency by 90%. We also found that stress-tolerant crop varieties were more effective in improving food security outcomes among households with large landholdings and with more educated and younger to middle-age heads. Effects of resilient livestock breeds on household food security were much stronger for households with large landholdings and with young and/or much older heads that have low levels of education. Given the large, demonstrated benefits from the use of the CSA technologies, policies and programs aimed at their promotion should apply appropriate targeting to ensure wider uptake of the technologies and maximum returns on investment.

TI  - Impact of Integrated Striga Management (ISM) technology on maize productivity in northern Nigeria: A treatment effect approach
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This paper evaluates the impact of adopting Integrated Striga Management (ISM) technologies on maize productivity among rural households of northern Nigeria. The study utilizes cross-sectional data collected in 2014 from a randomly selected 643 households. A treatment effect regression model was used to estimate the causal impact of ISM technology adoption on farm productivity. The results revealed that adoption of ISM technology has a significant positive impact on maize yield per hectare. This confirms the potential role of ISM technology adoption in the Striga infested areas in improving rural household productivity and its ability to withstand production risk. An analysis of the determinants of adoption suggested farmer age, cooperative membership, past participation in on-farm trials, access to cash remittances, access to fertilizer, access to improved seeds and yield perception as the key determinants of ISM technology adoption. Results from the treatment effect model indicate that adoption of ISM technologies has a positive effect on farm productivity, with adopters on average achieving a 47% increase in maize yield per ha above that of non-adopters. Policy implications for promoting ISM technology adoption and farm productivity are discussed.

TI  - In Search of Rural Entrepreneurship: Non-farm Household Enterprises (NFEs) as Instruments of Rural Transformation in Ethiopia
T2  - AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa is mainly agricultural and rural transformation remains slow owing to weak market-orientation and entrepreneurship development. This study aims at investigating determinants of households' enterprise engagement and effect on livelihood. Logit model and propensity score matching were employed to analyse data captured from 415 households in Ethiopia. The empirical model reveals that education, cooperatives, socio-economy, access to transport, communication, credit, and FTC were drivers of households' engagement in NFE. Livelihood was also significantly better for engaged households. It is suggested that policies to improve infrastructure, credit and extension, and promote rural cooperation would enhance Africa's smallholders' enterprise development.

TI  - Food Purchase from Family Farming in Public Institutions in the Northeast of Brazil: A Tool to Reach Sustainable Development Goals
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The purchase of food from family farming in public institutions in Brazil was boosted by the implementation of the public call modality. The National School Feeding Program-PNAE- and the Food Acquisition Program-PAA- are world references in terms of purchasing food from family farming. However, hindrances are still observed regarding the participation of small farmers in public purchase of food, reducing their participation and scope of the food products available. Using a cross-sectional approach, this study analyzed food from family farming purchased by federal institutes of education located at the northeast region of Brazil to characterize the profile of family farmers participating on public calls, identify the food required and verify the processing level of food present into these documents. The data obtained indicate that family farmers supply mainly in natura or minimally processed foods, especially fruits. Meat and meat products were not present and processed foods, such as cheese, were not purchased extensively from family farmers by federal institutes, even when farmers were grouped into cooperatives and associations. Failure to comply with sanitary requirements required in the public call process was the main reason for the non-homologation of some food from family farming. The data found in this study show that despite the advances that allowed the purchase of food from family farming in public educational institutions, it is necessary to find ways to increase the diversity of food. Investing in improving structural conditions would be a way to increase the quality and diversity of food provided by family farming in public institutions, contributing to the environmental, social, and health dimensions of sustainability.

AB  - Smallholder farmers in Rattanakmondol District, Battambang Province, Cambodia face challenges related to soil erosion, declining yields, climate change, and unsustainable tillage-based farming practices in their efforts to increase food production within maize-based systems. In 2010, research for development programs began introducing agricultural production systems based on conservation agriculture (CA) to smallholder farmers located in four communities within Rattanakmondol District as a pathway for addressing these issues. Understanding gendered practices and perspectives is integral to adapting CA technologies to the needs of local communities. This research identifies how gender differences regarding farmers' access to assets, practices, and engagement in intra-household negotiations could constrain or facilitate the dissemination of CA. Our mixed-methods approach includes focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews, famer field visits, and a household survey. Gender differences in access to key productive assets may affect men's and women's individual ability to adapt CA. Farmers perceive the practices and technologies of CA as labor-saving, with the potential to reduce men's and women's labor burden in land-preparation activities. However, when considered in relation to the full array of productive and reproductive livelihood activities, CA can disproportionately affect men's and women's labor. Decisions about agricultural livelihoods were not always made jointly, with socio-cultural norms and responsibilities structuring an individual's ability to participate in intra-household negotiations. While gender differences in power relations affect intra-household decision-making, men and women household members collectively negotiate the transition to CA-based production systems.

TI  - Profits and poverty: Certification's troubled link for Nicaragua's organic and fairtrade coffee producers
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Governments, donors and NGOs have promoted environmental and social certification schemes for coffee producers as certified market channels are assumed to offer higher prices and better incomes. Additionally, it is presumed that these certifications contribute to poverty reduction of smallholders. Yet, gross margins, profits and poverty levels of certified smallholder coffee producers have not yet been quantitatively analyzed applying random sampling techniques. Our quantitative household survey of 327 randomly selected members of conventional, organic and organic-fairtrade certified cooperatives in Nicaragua is complemented by over a hundred qualitative in-depth interviews. The results show that although farm-gate prices of certified coffees are higher than of conventional coffees, the profitability of certified coffee production and its subsequent effect on poverty levels is not clear-cut. Per capita net coffee incomes are insufficient to cover basic needs of all coffee producing households. Certified producers are more often found below the absolute poverty line than conventional producers. Over a period of ten years, our analysis shows that organic and organic-fairtrade farmers have become poorer relative to conventional producers. We conclude that coffee yield levels, profitability and efficiency need to be increased, because prices for certified coffee cannot compensate for low productivity, land or labor constraints.

TI  - Sugarcane outgrower schemes in Mozambique: Findings from the field
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL
AB  - Agro-industries have been widely acknowledged as a way to kick-start agricultural development in developing regions. A number of pro-poor organizations promote production models that include the engagement of smallholder farmers as potential enablers for employment generation, economic development and livelihood improvements. Initiatives such as this appear in Sub-Saharan Africa with a focus on food and bioenergy crops. However, the large-scale production of cash crops, such as sugarcane, also raises concerns. A critical aspect is the impact of land-use on food security, particularly if local communities are constrained in cultivating traditional crops. In this paper, we explore the relationship between a sugarcane mill and smallholder farmers in Maputo province, Mozambique. Our main goal was to investigate some key characteristics of sugarcane outgrower schemes and the implications for sustainable local development. We also complemented local findings with lessons learnt from other regions, such as Brazil. In August 2015, a field assessment examined the interplay between the sugarcane industry and local communities in southern Mozambique. We interviewed three smallholders' associations of sugarcane producers in Xinavane, together with researchers, non-governmental organizations and agricultural government bodies. Our assessment finds that the impacts of sugarcane remain somewhat unclear. Government bodies and some of the consulted NGOs claim benefits, both on income and local food production. However, these benefits are less evident to farmers. While they acknowledge labour and social services as opportunities brought by the sugar mill, progress on capacity building and irrigated areas for food production fall short of expectations. Moreover, there is also tension as to the sugarcane outgrower contract. Incomplete information seems to undermine trust from farmers who become increasingly sceptical of their contracts with the sugarcane mill, especially the payment system. Transparency, coupled with more effective food production strategies, are decisive to ensure sustainable agro-industrial development along with poverty reduction.

TI  - Household food security, economic empowerment, and the social capital of women's shea butter production in Mali
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Shea butter, an edible oil and lotion produced primarily by women in over twenty-one countries in sub-Saharan Africa and consumed locally and exported internationally, can contribute considerably to achievement of several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This study investigated the importance of shea butter to women and their families for food security, household economy, women's empowerment, and social capital. It highlights the vital social value of shea butter in cooperative labor for production, gifting customs among women, and traditional and religious ceremonies. In addition, this study identifies critical opportunities for and obstacles to further market expansion. Based on a mixed methods approach employed in Mali from 2009 to 2014, this study included participant observation, interviews, surveys, and focus group discussions as well as shea tree mapping and weighing of shea and firewood. Major challenges that exist for shea market expansion and food security potential include climate change and globalization of other competing world edible oils. Nevertheless, there are promising opportunities for the shea market with the extensive shea tree distribution, growth of consumer support for environmentally and socially conscious products, and capacity building efforts of rural shea nut collectors and butter producers by the Global Shea Alliance.

TI  - Collective influence of household and community capitals on agricultural employment as a measure of rural poverty in the Mahanadi Delta, India
T2  - AMBIO
AB  - The main determinants of agricultural employment are related to households' access to private assets and the influence of inherited social-economic stratification and power relationships. However, despite the recommendations of rural studies which have shown the importance of multilevel approaches to rural poverty, very few studies have explored quantitatively the effects of common-pool resources and household livelihood capitals on agricultural employment. Understanding the influence of access to both common-pool resources and private assets on rural livelihoods can enrich our understanding of the drivers of rural poverty in agrarian societies, which is central to achieving sustainable development pathways. Based on a participatory assessment conducted in rural communities in India, this paper differentiates two levels of livelihood capitals (household capitals and community capitals) and quantifies them using national census data and remotely sensed satellite sensor data. We characterise the effects of these two levels of livelihood capitals on precarious agricultural employment by using multilevel logistic regression. Our study brings a new perspective on livelihood studies and rural economics by demonstrating that common-pool resources and private assets do not have the same effect on agricultural livelihoods. It identifies that a lack of access to human, financial and social capitals at the household level increases the levels of precarious agricultural employment, such as daily-wage agricultural labour. Households located in communities with greater access to collective natural capital are less likely to be agricultural labourers. The statistical models also show that proximity to rural centres and access to financial infrastructures increase the likelihood of being a landless agricultural labourer. These findings suggest that investment in rural infrastructure might increase livelihood vulnerability, if not accompanied by an improvement in the provisioning of complementary rural services, such as access to rural finance, and by the implementation of agricultural tenancy laws to protect smallholders' productive assets.

TI  - Collective Property Leads to Household Investments: Lessons From Land Titling in Afro-Colombian Communities
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - In the developing world, collective land titling has become an important tool for recognizing the historical presence of ethnic communities and safeguarding their rights to occupy and manage their territories. However, little is known about the average impact of these titling processes on the well-being of these communities. In this paper we attempt to estimate the impact of collective land titling in territories inhabited by Afro-descendent communities in Colombia. We compare rural districts in titled areas with rural districts in untitled areas that are similar in all the relevant observable characteristics. We find that the collective titling process in the Choco region has caused an increase in average household per capita income, a decrease in extreme poverty, larger investments in housing, higher attendance rates among children in primary education, and a decrease in housing overcrowding. Our results suggest that collective land titling creates a more secure natural resource base and a longer time horizon for households in collective territories, which leads to investment in their private physical and human capital.

TI  - The Coffee Crisis, Fair Trade, and Agroecological Transformation: Impacts on Land-Use Change in Costa Rica
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - This research evaluated the impacts of Fair Trade marketing networks and shade-tree diversification on the reduction of land-use change out of coffee production in the district of Agua Buena, Costa Rica. These resistance strategies were deployed by smallholder coffee farmers in response to the "coffee crisis," which involved record low coffee commodity prices and record high external input costs. This research found that Fair Trade price premiums were inconsequential in providing support for smallholder resistance to land-use change out of coffee production. In contrast, the adoption of agroecological practices such as shade-tree diversification reduced reliance on costly external inputs, which allowed adopting producers to keep land in coffee production at a significantly higher rate than non-adopters. One conclusion drawn is that when addressing agricultural development crises, the promotion of agroecological practices that cut costs may be as good a strategy or better than one that focuses on enhancing yields or establishing price supports.

TI  - Impact of Market Participation on Household Food Security among Smallholder Irrigators in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Food insecurity is a global challenge. The reduction of hunger is a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target widely seen as a measure for evaluating the progress of the well-being of rural people. This study aimed to investigate the impact of collective action and market participation on household food security. Data were collected using a structured survey questionnaire from 243 randomly selected households in Msinga Local Municipality. The binary probit model findings revealed that farmers' group membership, market participation, gender, the total number of cattle owned, farm income, and credit access increased the likelihood of a food-secure household. This paper's findings have crucial implications for the government and other development agencies for improving household food-security status. The findings identified collective action and market participation to be contributing to food-insecurity alleviation. The government and private organisations need to encourage and empower existing farmers' groups through community mobilisation.

TI  - Maize Diversity, Market Access, and Poverty Reduction in the Western Highlands of Guatemala
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Guatemala; poverty reduction; maize; agricultural diversity; farmers' livelihoods; conservation through use.The western highlands of Guatemala lie within the area where maize was first domesticated, and maize remains central to farmers' livelihood security. Over 50% of the population in the region are in poverty, and over 48% suffer from chronic malnutrition. Development efforts have focused on improved land management, crop diversification, and improved access to markets, especially for high-value vegetable crops such as snow peas. As a result of successful initiatives worldwide, more attention is being directed at the extent to which farmers can benefit from market opportunities for indigenous crops by receiving a price premium for providing the environmental service of conserving agricultural biodiversity. Such an approach bridges the gap between poverty alleviation and in situ conservation. We explored this potential development pathway through both qualitative and quantitative research. Focus groups were conducted in 5 communities in the maize-growing highlands of Guatemala, followed by a survey of 989 farm households in 59 locations. Our results show that most farmers in the western highlands of Guatemala are severely maize deficient; on average, farm households produce enough maize for only 6.9 months of consumption a year and are forced to purchase maize to meet basic consumption needs. The results are in sharp contrast to research conducted in highland communities in neighboring Mexico, where many farmers are able to sell their maize in relatively lucrative specialty maize markets. In the context of renewed interest in reducing poverty in Central America, our research suggests that rather than focus on market development for local maize varieties, development efforts should target other types of interventions.

TI  - Can Agricultural Cooperatives Reduce Poverty? Heterogeneous Impact of Cooperative Membership on Farmers' Welfare in Rwanda
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES AND POLICY
AB  - We analyze the inclusiveness and effectiveness of agricultural cooperatives in Rwanda. We estimate mean income and poverty effects of cooperative membership using propensity score matching techniques. We analyze heterogeneous treatment effects across farmers by analyzing how estimated treatment effects vary over farm and farmer characteristics and over the estimated propensity score. We find that cooperative membership in general increases income and reduces poverty and that these effects are largest for larger farms and in more remote areas. We find evidence of a negative selection because impact is largest for farmers with the lowest propensity to be a cooperative member.

TI  - Reverse-Share-Tenancy and Agricultural Efficiency: Farm-Level Evidence from Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES
AB  - Using a unique tenant-landlord matched dataset from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, we are able to show how the tenants' strategic response to the varying economic and tenure-security status of the landlords helps explain sharecroppers' productivity differentials. The study reveals that sharecroppers' yields are significantly lower on plots leased from landlords who are non-kin and landlords with weaker economic and tenure-security status (such as female) than on plots leased from landlords with the contrasting characteristics. While, on aggregate, the results show no significant efficiency loss on kin-operated sharecropped plots, more decomposed analyses indicate strong evidence of Marshallian inefficiency on kin-operated plots leased from landlords with weaker bargaining power and higher tenure insecurity. This study thus shows how failure to control for the heterogeneity of landowners' characteristics can explain the lack of clarity in the existing empirical literature on the extent of moral hazard problems in sharecropping contracts.

TI  - Factors affecting the innovation potential of smallholder farmers in the Caribbean Community
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - The need for domestic smallholder farming systems to better support food and nutrition security in the Caribbean is a pressing challenge. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) faces complex socio-ecological challenges related to historical legacies of plantation agriculture, small population sizes, geographic isolation, jurisdictional diversity, and proneness to natural disasters, all of which underscore the importance of fostering system-wide innovation potential. This paper explores the factors that are impacting the innovation potential of smallholder farming households in four CARICOM small island developing states (St. Lucia, St. Kitts-Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana) using data collected through producer household surveys, focus groups, and key informant interviews. Results indicate that a systemic lack of access to finance, markets, and knowledge networks is perceived as limiting smallholder innovation potential in the region. Compounding these challenges was a pervasive lack of trust reported between actors and institutions throughout the agricultural innovation system, hindering the potential for collective action. Our findings point to the need for more decentralized governance approaches that are capable of establishing stronger relationships between actors and institutions to enhance knowledge flows in support of regional rural development and food and nutrition security objectives.

It also analyzes the factors influencing participation in cooperatives among rural households in Southwest, Nigeria. The study was designed to account for selection bias into cooperative organizations. Rural household survey data were used and the estimates were based on both the Probit model and non-parametric propensity score matching method. The findings show that income generated through cooperative membership is approximately 10% higher than those generated by noncooperative members. Empirical estimates of determinants of cooperative membership indicate that years of education, age and land size have significant influences on the decision to join cooperatives.

TI  - Rush for cash crops and forest protection: Neither land sparing nor land sharing
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - In many countries with large tracts of tropical forests, there is a dual focus on enhancing forest protection and increasing commercial agriculture for economic development. Laos is a case in point for this development as the Government of Laos (GoL) has a strong commitment to economic growth, which rural farmers in part help realize through a rush for cash crop production destined to be sold in neighboring countries. Maize cultivation, for example, is rapidly expanding and grown under a contract-farming system for Vietnamese markets. At the same time, GoL attempts to increase nationwide forest cover and prepares for REDD+ (reducing deforestation and forest degradation). This paper explores how the recent boom in cash crops is impacting land use and livelihoods of local communities, as well as affecting forest conservation in Hua Meuang District of Huaphan Province in northeastern Laos. We also examine how local authorities react to these changes and navigate the contradicting policies. Furthermore, the paper analyzes to what extent the land sparing intention of land- and forest-land allocation policies are fulfilled. We found that the production of maize has rapidly expanded in Hua Meuang District since the mid-2000s as a result of high demands for maize in Vietnam and because local authorities see the crop as a way to reduce rural poverty and reduce traditional subsistence shifting cultivation practices. Communities have increased the areas that they dedicate to maize cultivation and have achieved an increase in both income and household assets. Maize has replaced upland rice cultivation as well as primary and secondary forests. Although the government policies aim to spare land for forest conservation by intensifying agriculture, the result is rapid agricultural expansion and no spared forest. Moreover, the traditional land-sharing landscapes with forest, fallows, and fields are being transformed, creating landscapes that are increasingly dominated by agriculture. This may still be in line with economic development policies, but it is at odds with forest conservation policies, REDD+ policies, and the GoL target of increasing forest cover in the country.

TI  - Household Out-of-Pocket Expenses on Health: Does Disease Type Matter?
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES
AB  - This study uses new household data from Burkina Faso and regression analysis to further our understanding of household behaviour in relation to health care systems. We model the household decision-making process regarding health care utilisation in three steps: the perception of illness, choosing a treatment regime and health expenditure. In particular, we explain-at the individual level-the contraction of one of four diseases (malaria, digestive tract problems, respiratory infection and influenza). We then explain the choice of a treatment regime-home treatment or treatment at a public health facility-conditional upon the individual contracting a particular disease and estimate a health expenditure function conditional upon an individual contracting a particular disease and on the choice of treatment. Disease type is found to explain both treatment choice and health care expenditure with households more likely to opt for home treatment for influenza and with respiratory infection as the most expensive to treat. We also find that treatment at a public health facility implies much higher expenses. Our results also point to a gender bias with health care spending significantly higher for male household members. Further, asset poor households are more likely to opt for home treatment while migrants, as a source of information or even medication, reduce this likelihood.

TI  - Inclusiveness and effectiveness of agricultural cooperatives: recent evidence from Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose Using a recent rural farm household survey, the purpose of this paper is to investigate inclusiveness and effectiveness of agricultural cooperatives in Ethiopia.
   Design/methodology/approach The study employs a logit model to examine inclusiveness and an endogenous switching regression (ESR) model to evaluate the effectiveness of agricultural cooperatives.
   Findings The results show that agricultural cooperatives are less inclusive of land-poor and illiterate households. On the other hand, the estimated results indicate that cooperatives effectively improved agricultural performance and welfare of its member households - i.e. membership in cooperatives increases yield and income by 1.37 quintal/hectare and 1,804 birr, respectively. Moreover, the result shows that marketing cooperatives effectively increased marketed surplus of their members by 34 percent.
   Research limitations/implications The study has important implications regarding the ways to improve the effectiveness and/or inclusiveness of agricultural cooperatives.
   Originality/value While accounting for the collective behavior of cooperatives, this study uses multiple outcome variables in examining the effectiveness of cooperatives in Ethiopia. Furthermore, this paper employs the ESR model and accounts for potential problems in estimating impact using non-experimental data.

TI  - Household dynamics and the bargaining power of women in artisanal and small-scale mining in sub-Saharan Africa: A Ghanaian case study
T2  - RESOURCES POLICY
AB  - With the increasing participation of women in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) across many sub-Saharan African countries, the ASM sector offers women artisanal miners considerable income that gives them better opportunities at household decision-making. While the existing literature has widely studied intrahousehold dynamics in domains such as agriculture and health, very little is known about the bargaining power of women in ASM and their household dynamics. Through in-depth interviews with 49 women artisanal miners in Prestea-Bondaye mining area in the Prestea-Huni Valley Municipality of Ghana, this paper considers how women's engagement in ASM changes the dynamics within their households and impacts their bargaining power. Findings showed that most women artisanal miners were not in support of pooling income with their husbands with most of them using their income to alter the dynamics of household decision-making concerning food to cook for the family, children's education and family size. Extended family relations as a form of social norm were found to determine women artisanal miners' decision not to pool income with their husbands. The findings, therefore, problematise the unitary model of household decision-making and provide a nuanced analysis of rural household power dynamics in a mining context, which is grossly unexplored. However, various aspects of intrahousehold bargaining models - cooperative, non-cooperative and collective - were found under different circumstances depending on the household needs and artisanal women miners' relations with husbands and their extended family. Findings also showed that women's participation in ASM was changing household dynamics, particularly sexual interactions with their partners and childcare responsibilities. Although women's participation in ASM results in higher levels of bargaining power, the Minerals Commission of Ghana, gender advocacy institutions and other relevant stakeholders must engage in policy discussions to streamline women's activities and find possible ways of dealing with their challenges in the sector.

TI  - Why secondary towns can be important for poverty reduction - A migrant perspective
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This paper develops the concept of 'action space' as the range of possible destinations a migrant can realistically move to at a given point in time and, intimately linked to this, the set of possible livelihoods at destination. We show how this space expands and contracts over time through "cumulative causation". Such a dynamic framework allows us to appreciate the role of secondary towns in rural-urban migration and poverty reduction. Secondary towns occupy a unique middle ground between semi-subsistence agriculture and the capitalistic city; between what is close-by and familiar and what is much further away and unknown. By opening up the horizons of the (poorer) rural population and facilitating navigation of the non-farm economy, secondary towns allow a broader base of the poor population to become physically, economically and socially mobile. Secondary towns therefore have great potential as vehicles for inclusive growth and poverty reduction in urbanizing developing countries.

TI  - Intra-household Efficiency in Extended Family Households: Evidence from Rural India
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - The extended family household, in which multiple generations or married siblings of a family live together, is common in developing countries. We conducted a series of public goods experiments in such households in five villages in rural North India to shed light on decision-making efficiency within this household structure. In this experiment, we offered household members the choice to receive either a lower amount over which they have private control or a higher payout that becomes a common resource. We measure efficiency as the degree to which individuals are willing to forego personal rewards for larger, collective rewards. We find that relationships within extended households are not equally efficient, with the relationship between the daughter-in-law and mother-in-law particularly problematic. Supplementary survey and qualitative evidence points to the role of decision-making power, with young, married women lacking the power to assert their preferences in extended households and resorting to actions that reduce the overall efficiency of the household.

TI  - Bounded Rationality, Social Capital and Technology Adoption in Family Farming: Evidence from Cocoa-Tree Crops in Ivory Coast
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In this paper, we allege that the hypothesis in favor of bounded rationality is a plausible explanation when it comes to better understanding the sluggish pace of adoption of best available tree crop farming techniques in poor small-scale rural communities. Our research builds on data collection and analysis of cocoa farming in Ivory Coast. Firstly, we find that the cognitive scarcity under which smallholder farmers make their decisions, in particular, satisficing behavior and fast and frugal heuristics, outweigh the scarcity of financial and human resources. Secondly, we show that the structure of the environment measured through various dimensions of social capital influences human rationality and decision-making. On the one hand, the greater smallholder farmers' civic capital (solidarity, reciprocity, trustworthiness, cooperation), the more likely they are to modify their farming practices (p < 0.05) and, more specifically, to exchange information, learn, and eventually revise these practices. On the other hand, the greater the number of organizations the farmers participate in, the greater the probability of modifying their practices (p < 0.01). Information about farming techniques disseminates through weak bridging ties built within agricultural organizations (e.g., cooperatives, extension services) rather than through strong bonding ties between family or diaspora members.

TI  - Land and agricultural commercialisation in Meru County, Kenya: evidence from three models
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - What are the relative pros and cons of different pathways of agricultural commercialisation in Africa? This paper examines aspects of three commercial farming cases, each of which represents one of the three most dominant models of commercial agriculture - small-scale outgrowers, medium-size commercial farms and a large estate - in the high-potential area of Meru County in Kenya. The paper provides a comparative perspective across the cases, examining their outcomes in terms of land relations, labour, livelihoods and local economic linkages. The study used a mixed-methods approach, including a household survey and a range of qualitative methods including detailed life histories. We find diverse dynamics across our cases: increasing land consolidation spurred by the rising class of commercial coffee farmers, but also land fragmentation as a result of population pressure and prevalence of inheritance as a pathway to land acquisition in the case of horticultural outgrowers. The plantation generates relatively better paid employment for permanent skilled workers, while the commercial farms create employment for casualised, insecure and poorly paid seasonal labour. These labour regimes are highly gendered. The outgrowers combine family and hired labour. Across the three cases, farmers diversify income between on-farm and off-farm sources. The commercial and outgrower farms are dynamically integrated into the local economy, while the estate is less so. These features of the three models generate processes of social differentiation, which are reshaping the agrarian structure and rural economy in Meru County.

TI  - Strengthening climate adaptation in the northern region of Ghana: insights from a stakeholder analysis
T2  - CLIMATE POLICY
AB  - Climate change significantly impacts agriculture. Building an informed and collaborative process among stakeholders remains vital in minimizing climate risks and building climate-adaptive and resilient agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, stakeholders' involvement and collaboration in agriculture decision-making are framed by institutional, power, and resource dynamics, often ignoring vulnerable stakeholders most susceptible to climate shocks. These collaborative dynamics are less studied in the climate adaptation literature, especially in the context of Ghana and SSA. This study promotes stakeholder engagement and collaboration in climate-adaptive and conservation agriculture (CA) by examining the influence of and relationship dynamics among key stakeholders in the northern region of Ghana (NRG). Drawing from the normative stakeholder theory and literature on climate adaptation intervention, we use multiple qualitative research methods (e.g. brainstorming, semi-structured interviews, and focus group sessions) to profile and explore stakeholders' roles, interests, and collaboration in CA and adaptation interventions. Our findings suggest that collaborations in CA in these smallholder farming communities are often fragmented, providing few collaboration advantages to smallholder farmers. Where collaboration occurs, it is often characterized by redundancy or duplication of roles and functions performed by stakeholders, poor coordination among key government actors, or by conflictual relationships among non-governmental organizations (NGOs); relationships amongst stakeholders are often driven by conflicting interests and asymmetric power differentials. These findings suggest that measures to engage stakeholders must carefully consider aligning stakeholders' interests and addressing power differentials, which are necessary to minimize conflicts in collaborative governance arrangements for adaptation and CA. Key policy insights: Conservation agriculture (CA) creates resilient agricultural systems for enhanced food security and poverty alleviation. Stakeholder roles, interests, and collaborations should be identified to understand who should be included to establish a collaborative connection for adaptation planning. Policymakers should actively engage stakeholders, including smallholder farmers, in the design and implementation of climate adaptation planning and interventions. As the principal resource for adaptation planning and decision-making is the people themselves, engaging them will leverage their knowledge, experiences, and expertise for the design of effective adaptation policies and ensure effective implementation. Collaborative action involving stakeholders can promote effective action on climate change by fostering consensus and building local ability and expertise to collectively adopt adaptation measures.

TI  - Nexus of Cash Crop Production Using Improved Varieties and Household Food Security
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - This study evaluates the impact of adopting improved sesame varieties on farm household food security using the data collected in 2018 from potential sesame-growing districts in northwestern Ethiopia. Selectivity and endogeneity probleSms were addressed by endogenous switching regression and the propensity score matching approach. Thus, we estimated the influence of technology adoption on different food security indicators. Our findings indicate that the adoption of new sesame varieties significantly reduced the propensity of food insecurity through increased food consumption expenditures, improved nutritional food intake (consumption scores), and the probability of food security of a household. The finding supports that there is a positive relationship between cash crops and food security. Access to improved sesame seeds, a cash liquidity advantage, extension service efficiency, and farmers' networking have a significant and positive effect on the adoption of improved sesame varieties. Hence, development policies should be established to motivate cash crop seed multipliers and research institutes to satisfy the seed demand, improve extension service efficiency, and support rural farmers' primary cooperative. The study enriches the current debate on the subject and provides new empirical evidence of the synergy between cash crops and food security.

TI  - The impact of the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme on the "health poverty alleviation" of rural households in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB  - This study investigates the impact of the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) on rural households to escape poverty. We employ the instrumental variable method, the IVProbit model, to analyze the national data from the rural-resident field survey by the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) in 2016. Based on the large-scale data, we found that, first, the hospitalization of family members is the key factor in increasing the risk of the family falling into poverty. The NRCMS has significantly reduced the likely risk of falling into poverty. Second, the impact of the NRCMS on poverty alleviation varies among groups with different levels of income. There is no impact on the upper-middle and high-income groups; in contrast, the NRCMS has substantially improved the capacity of low-income rural families to prevent poverty due to illness, especially for the lower-middle-income group. Third, there exist significant regional differences in the impact of NRCMS on the health poverty alleviation of rural households in China. The NRCMS has successfully reduced the risk of rural households in the western region falling into poverty, simultaneously, no significant impact on those in the eastern and central regions. In order to diminish and eliminate poverty eventually and boost rural residents? capacity for income acquisition, we propose the following: raise the actual compensation ratio of the NRCMS, control the rising expense of NRCMS by promoting the payment method reform, construct the comprehensive healthcare system in the western region, strengthen the medical security for the poor in remote area, and enhance the living environment for rural residents.

TI  - COVID-19 outbreak and rural household food security in the Western Democratic Republic of the Congo
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Although global assessments of the initial impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have focused on in-come, jobs, and health conditions, this study constitutes one of the first studies that assessed the impact of COVID-19 on food security in DRC and established the short-term implications of the COVID-19 outbreak on rural households' food security in DRC. In addition, the study recommendations contributed to shaping gov-ernment interventions toward the pandemic in the Country. The study used data from four western provinces of the country on 1339 households. Our results show that 80 % of households experienced an increase in food prices, 61 % a noticeable decrease in the availability of food, and 54 % a decrease in their dietary diversity. Due to changes in food availability, dietary diversity, and food accessibility imposed by the COVID-19 outbreak, >70 % of households experienced either a decrease in the consumption of meat, milk, fish, and cereals or an increase in their consumption of traditional vegetables. In addition, COVID-19 significantly affected food security di-mensions in larger households, households with a greater number of members aged 35 years and above, households headed by women, households where members participate in associations or cooperatives, house-holds that depend on crop sales as the major source of income, and in poorer households. These findings highlight the significant implications of the COVID-19 outbreak on household food security in western DRC and underscore the need for emergency interventions to strengthen the resilience of rural people and accelerate their recovery and other long-term measures toward sustainable and inclusive development.

TI  - Does contract farming improve rice farmers' food security? Empirical evidence from Ghana
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Purpose In order to improve access to resources for smallholder farmers, efforts are being made to promote contract farming in Ghana. This is seen as a strategy to increase agricultural productivity of farmers, give better market access and guarantee adequate supply of raw materials to agro-based industries. However, the challenge is whether contract farming leads to improvement in food security status of farmers. The study therefore seeks to explore to what extent farmers' food security status is influenced by their participation in contract farming activities. Design/methodology/approach Using Cragg's double-hurdle model to analyse participation in contract farming, the authors control for selection bias using propensity score matching applied to a data set of 336 observations to examine the impact of contract farming on the food security levels of rice farmers in Ghana. Findings The results of this study show that yield of paddy and the wealth of the farmer are the main factors that influence the quantity of paddy rice to be contracted in contract farming arrangements. This study also finds that participation in contract farming will increase food security by 109%. In conclusion, contract farming has a significant positive impact on the farmers' food security status. Originality/value Agricultural policies and rural development initiatives supporting the promotion and expansion of contract farming should be pursued to persuade more farmers to produce under contract farming agreements.

TI  - Determinants of household contributions to collective irrigation management: The case of the Doho Rice Scheme in Uganda
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - In order to explore the conditions for successful communal irrigation management, this study investigates the determinants of household contributions to the cleaning of irrigation channels and the availability of water. By using household-level data collected in a large-scale gravity irrigation scheme in Uganda, whose management was transferred from the government to the community, we find that household contributions to the cleaning of irrigation channels are determined by the scarcity of irrigation water, the opportunity cost of labor and the private benefit associated with plot size. We also find that the availability of irrigation water increases in the tertiary irrigation canal where the coefficient of variation of plot size is large, which may indicate that farmers of larger plots are particularly active in water management. These findings suggest that farmers are responsive to private benefits and, hence, the support of the government for communities to implement punishment may be effective for successful irrigation management.

TI  - Factors Associated with Household Food Security in Zambia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Food security is a global challenge and threatens mainly smallholder farmers in developing countries. The main aim of this paper is to determine factors that are associated with food security in Zambia. This study utilizes the household questionnaire survey dataset of 400 smallholder farmers in four districts conducted in southern Zambia in 2016. To measure food security, the study employs two food security indicators, namely the food consumption score (FCS) and the household hunger scale (HHS). Two ordered probit models are estimated with the dependent variables FCS and HHS. Both the FCS and HHS models' findings reveal that higher education levels of household head, increasing livestock income, secure land tenure, increasing land size, and group membership increase the probability of household food and nutrition security. The results imply that policies supporting livestock development programs such as training of farmers in animal husbandry, as well as policies increasing land tenure security and empowerment of farmers groups, have the potential to enhance household food and nutrition security.

TI  - Who are the poor? Measuring wealth inequality to aid understanding of socioeconomic contexts for conservation: a case-study from the Solomon Islands
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Understanding the local socioeconomic context is important for the design of appropriate conservation initiatives and associated monitoring strategies, especially in areas with high degrees of inequality, to ensure conservation interventions do not inadvertently further disadvantage vulnerable people. Typical assessments of wealth inequality in remote rural areas are constrained by limited engagement with a cash economy, complex family and tribal ties, and an absence of basic infrastructure. This paper presents a simple participatory approach to measure wealth inequality that does not predefine indicators, such as income or assets, but allows the local people choose the most appropriate indicators. A case study from the Solomon Islands revealed poor households in Kahua were characterized by fewer members, fewer members of working age, and fewer male members than wealthier households. The poor also owned fewer of the locally defined indicators of wealth that were collectively correlated with limited land tenure, and, consequently, conservation or development initiatives that are tied to land in Kahua will be less likely to assist the poorest. Adopting this participatory approach could improve the effectiveness of community-based conservation, through facilitating opportunities to explore local poverty and routes for alleviation.

TI  - Smallholder cooperatives and agricultural performance in Rwanda: do organizational differences matter?
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Agricultural policies in Rwanda focus on agricultural intensification and increased market orientation of the smallholder farm sector. Cooperatives are seen as key vehicles in this, but little is known about their effectiveness to achieve these goals. In this article, we analyze the impact of cooperative membership on the agricultural performance of rural households in Rwanda. We use cross-sectional survey data, collected in 2012, to analyze the impact of cooperative membership on different agricultural performance indicators, including indicators on agricultural intensification, market orientation, farm revenue, and income. We use several econometric techniques to deal with potential selection bias in estimating the impact of cooperative membership, including a proxy variable method based on a willingness to pay measure and propensity score matching methods. We find that cooperative membership in general has a positive impact on farm performance but these effects are driven by specific types of cooperatives.

TI  - Personal social capital and voluntary participation in the Village Development Programme in rural Sri Lanka
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study examines whether voluntary participation in the Village Development Programme in rural Sri Lanka promotes personal social capital. We use an original survey of 595 households in six rural villages in Kalutara district, Sri Lanka, and apply matching methods. The analysis finds a positive effect of voluntary participation on personal social capital. However, once we consider the degree of participation by classifying participants into nominal and active participants, status changes from nonparticipants to nominal participants nurture personal social capital, but status changes from nominal to active participants fail to enhance personal social capital. Our findings suggest that increasing the level of participation does not necessarily contribute to social capital development in a linear way because active participation may bring about not just positive features-such as frequent interactions with others or experiences of successful collaboration-but also conflict among community members.

TI  - Individual and collective rationality in pastoral production: Evidence from Northern Kenya
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
AB  - This study explores the individual and collective rationality of livestock accumulation in pastoral production using data gathered in northern Kenya. Results suggest accumulating wealth in livestock even when facing the prospect of sudden dramatic loss makes sense at the household level, and that there is limited empirical support to the contention that herd accumulation at the household level imposes a cost on other households. I conclude by arguing the record of failure in pastoral development may be at least partially due to a faulty conceptual foundation, and suggest facilitating herd accumulation may offer more promise than discouraging it.

TI  - Gendered and generational tensions in increased land commercialisation: Rural livelihood diversification, changing land use, and food security in Ghana's Brong-Ahafo region
T2  - GEO-GEOGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Many smallholder farmers in Jaman North District, Brong-Ahafo Region, Ghana are shifting from food crop production to increased cultivation of cashew, an export cash crop. This paper examines gendered and generational tensions in increased commercialisation of land, livelihood diversification, and household food security in the context of globalisation and environmental change. Using qualitative, participatory research with 60 middle-generation men and women, young people and key stakeholders, the research found that community members valued the additional income stream. Young people and women, however, were apprehensive about the long-term consequences for food security of allocating so much land to cashew plantations. Young, middle, and older generations were concerned about their weak bargaining position in negotiating fair prices with export companies and intermediaries. Greater integration into the global economy exposed rural actors to multiple risks and inequalities, such as the uneven effects of economic globalisation, rises in food prices, hunger and food insecurity, growing competition for land, youth outmigration and climate change. The shift towards cashew cultivation appears to be exacerbating gender and generational inequalities in access to land and food insecurity and leading to exploitation within the global agri-food supply chain among already vulnerable rural communities in the global South. With stronger farmer associations and cooperatives, however, cashew farmers stand the chance of benefitting from greater integration into the global economy, through strengthened bargaining positions. Greater understanding is needed about the complex interactions between sustainable food systems, changing land use and gender and generational inequalities in rural spaces.

TI  - Can coffee certification schemes increase incomes of smallholder farmers? Evidence from Jinotega, Nicaragua
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of Fairtrade and organic certification on household income of smallholder coffee farmers in the Jinotega Municipality of Nicaragua. Using a sample of 233 coffee farming households and employing endogenous switching regression model and propensity score matching method, the results found that Fairtrade and organic certification standards have different effects on the certified farmers; while Fairtrade farmers had experienced yield gains, organic farmers had the price advantage. However, the overall impact of these certification standards on the total household income is found to be statistically not significant. While some of the Fairtrade-certified cooperatives have used the social premium in creating community-level infrastructure, there is a need for more investment. The major constraint the organic-certified farmers face is lack of availability of adequate organic inputs such as manures and organic herbicides.

TI  - Farmer organizations and maize productivity in rural Burkina Faso: The effects of the diversion strategy on cotton input loans
T2  - REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - This study analyzes the impact of the diversion strategy of cotton inputs on maize productivity among farmer organization (FO) members in Burkina Faso, based on an endogenous treatment effect model. This impact is assessed by measuring the effects of the producers' strategy of using part of their cotton inputs for growing other crops, such as maize. The data from a 2014 multisectoral survey in Burkina Faso were used. The main result is that maize productivity is 59.11% lower for FO members who divert their cotton inputs. We suggest the development of financing systems for cereals, similar to those in the cotton sector, and the establishment of monitoring the use of input credits.

TI  - Rice Subsector Development and Farmer Efficiency in Nepal: Implications for Further Transformation and Food Security
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - With economic development agricultural systems in the Global South transform from subsistence farming to higher productivity with market integration and increase in rural income and food security. In Nepal, agriculture continues to provide livelihoods for two-thirds of the predominantly rural population, largely at a subsistence-level. Rice is the staple food and covers the largest land area but yields are relatively low, with an annual import bill of USD 300 Million. The study uses data from 310 households from two distinct rice producing areas to assess farmers' rice production systems. It analyses farmers' rice production efficiency using a stochastic frontier production function to suggest how to advance the transformation of Nepal's rice sector. Our study finds that while agriculture related services such as access to inputs, information, markets, irrigation, and finance have generally improved, paddy farmers are only able to achieve 76% of potential output. Small/marginal farms were relatively less efficient than medium and large farms. Women farmers faced unequal access to technologies and have lower productivity than men. Unavailability of labor and capital, land fragmentation, and the lack of consistent access to seed and fertilizers contribute to reduced efficiency. Public and private sector investments are needed to enhance the timely and adequate access to quality seeds, fertilizers, processing facilities, and equipment services. Adopting a market systems approach through cooperative farming, targeted delivery of extension services, and linkages with rice millers can promote inclusive growth and improve rice food security in Nepal.

TI  - Do Payments Pay Off? Evidence from Participation in Costa Rica's PES Program
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Payments for environmental services (PES) are often viewed as a way to simultaneously improve conservation outcomes and the wellbeing of rural households who receive the payments. However, evidence for such win-win outcomes has been elusive. We add to the growing literature on conservation program impacts by using primary household survey data to evaluate the socioeconomic impacts of participation in Costa Rica's PES program. Despite the substantial cash transfers to voluntary participants in this program, we do not detect any evidence of impacts on their wealth or self-reported well-being using a quasi-experimental design. These results are consistent with the common claim that voluntary PES do not harm participants, but they beg the question of why landowners participate if they do not benefit. Landowners in our sample voluntarily renewed their contracts after five years in the program and thus are unlikely to have underestimated their costs of participation. They apparently did not invest additional income from the program in farm inputs such as cattle or hired labor, since both decreased as a result of participation. Nor do we find evidence that participation encouraged moves off-farm. Instead, semi-structured interviews suggest that participants joined the program to secure their property rights and contribute to the public good of forest conservation. Thus, in order to understand the social impacts of PES, we need to look beyond simple economic rationales and material outcomes.

TI  - Accessing value-added market through cooperatives: a case study of Sitajakhala Dugdha Utpadak Samabai Samiti Ltd., India
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose Member-owned business organizations, such as cooperatives, are engaged in various economic activities that touch our everyday lives. Sitajakhala Dugdha Utpadak Samabai Samiti Limited (Sitajakhala Dairy Producers Cooperative Society Limited) is a successful cooperative society in the northeastern region of India. The purpose of this case study is to illustrate how the cooperative manages its production and supply chain of milk and milk products and highlights several issues that the cooperative encountered in the recent past and how those issues were managed. This case also illustrates how an agribusiness cooperative has been growing over the years, including expansion of business and the creation of a brand image, as well as benefiting its members and their communities. Design/methodology/approach The authors used a case study approach where they went for in-person interviews of Sitajakhala's executive members and office staff; in addition, the authors were given access to Sitajakhala's marketing and financial records as well as its annual reports and vision documents. Findings Sitajakhala Co-op provides a platform where individual dairy farmers (most of who are small farmers and many of them are illiterate) can unite to bargain for higher prices for their milk. Due to its member-oriented business strategy, Sitajakhala Co-op has been growing well with active support of its members. Consistent quality control and marked improvements in labeling, bottling and packaging of milk and milk products has helped the cooperative to establish itself as a leader in dairy products supplier in Assam among bulk buyers as well as individual consumers. Sitajakhala cooperative also provides dairy farming related services to its members for free of charge to improve milk production and quality. One of the shortcomings of the cooperative is underutilization of its modern milk processing plant which needs to be addressed by the management in earnest. Research limitations/implications This case study is based on information from one dairy cooperative in Assam, India; thus, the findings of this case may not translate into other dairy cooperatives in India or elsewhere. Nonetheless, cooperative practitioners may find the findings useful from a management perspective. Social implications Sitajakhala Co-op management was keenly aware of the non-dairy related needs of the community it serves. Some of such services include free medical ambulance service for its members, supporting secondary education through providing merit and need-based scholarships and funding physical improvements to a local high school and a local college. In addition, the cooperative regularly provides funding to local sports and cultural events and local social institutions which have positive impact on the larger community. Sitajakhala cooperative has been providing employment to the local youth in the Morigaon area and plans on continuing to do so. Originality/value To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case study focusing on the management and operations of a dairy cooperative in the northeastern part of India. Knowledge gained from such study is expected to benefit not only Sitajakhala cooperative but also other dairy cooperatives in a similar situation. This case study will also benefit senior undergraduate and/or graduate students specializing in agricultural economics/agribusiness and can also be used for executive training for the management of academic institutions and food companies.

TI  - Soil conservation practices and production efficiency of smallholder farms in Central China
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The aim of this paper is to evaluate and analyze the impact of adoption of soil conservation practices (SCPs) on the technical efficiency of smallholder rice producers in Central China. We address self-selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity problems by estimating a switching regression model for the adoption decision function and separate stochastic production frontiers for SCP and Conventional farms while allowing for production inefficiency. SCP farms exhibit statistically higher average technical efficiency than Conventional farms. Education, extension services, membership in cooperatives, access to credit, and alternative income sources are positively and significantly associated with technical efficiency for both groups. Conventional farms display higher partial output elasticity for land, while only SCP farms show significant elasticity for capital.

TI  - Heterogeneous Impact of a Collective Payment for Environmental Services Scheme on Reducing Deforestation in Cambodia
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Payments for Environmental Services (PES) are increasingly used in tropical countries as incentives to improve forest conservation outcomes, notably in forests managed or owned by rural communities. However, little is known about the performance and the suitable conditions under which collective PES can be effective. We assess the impact of a collective PES on reducing deforestation in the Cardamom Mountains, Cambodia. We use a quasi-experimental approach combining covariate matching with difference-in-difference estimation as a procedure to assess program effectiveness on reducing deforestation. We find that the PES program contributed additionally saving on average about 0.17 percentage point of the enrolled PES area per year during 2005-12. We also highlight that characteristics such as slope, proximity to roads, and number of households are associated with heterogeneous PES impact. We finally call for improving both data availability and impact assessment methods in order to test better theories of change that take into account not only the ability of payments to reduce opportunity costs of conservation but also to consider how PES are turned into improved community collective action likely to improve the local enforcement of conservation.

TI  - Is a cooperative approach to seaweed farming effectual? An analysis of the seaweed cluster project (SCP), Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY
CP  - 22nd International Seaweed Symposium (ISS)
AB  - Seaweed (Kappaphycus spp.) farming has been practised in Malaysia since the late 1970s following government policy incentives (training and farming inputs). However, numerous governance, economic, environmental, technological and sociocultural challenges have limited the industry from achieving its full potential. The Seaweed Cluster Project (SCP) was introduced in 2012 to address some of these challenges. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of the SCP in delivering its central objectives of increasing seaweed production, optimising the farming area, improving seaweed quality and farming efficiency, raising farmers' income, and reducing the environmental impact of seaweed farming. Community and industry perceptions of the SCP were obtained from seven communities using a mixed-methods approach based on face-to-face semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, household surveys, observation and secondary data. Views on the SCP outcomes were generally negative, including low take-up rates by indigenous people, poor stakeholder participation in decision-making, limited acceptance of new technologies, economic vulnerability, a complex marketing system, and low social cohesion of seaweed farming communities. Positive perceptions included recognition that the SCP confers high social status upon a community, reduces operating costs, and facilitates the production of certified seaweed. The SCP's problems are linked to poor multi-level governance, weak market mechanisms and unintegrated community development. The study concludes with five recommendations to improve the SCP: promote the participation of indigenous people; legalise existing migrant farmers; strengthen local seaweed cooperative organisations; provide entrepreneurship skills to farmers; and fully integrate stakeholders into decision-making.

TI  - Global Questions, Local Answers: Soil Management and Sustainable Intensification in Diverse Socioeconomic Contexts of Cuba
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB  - In the complex context of global food and agricultural systems, research in agriculture must respond to multidisciplinary questions of economic development, ecological sustainability and food justice. With the objective of responding to several of the most important questions facing agriculture today, this article describes recent research in three Cuban cropping systems: state farms, cooperatives, and small family farmers. Soil management is considered here as a crux of human intervention in agroecosystems, capable of determining the impacts of productive activities upon agricultural and ecosystem functions. Management practices commonly used in each farm system are evaluated using two systems of indicators, one for technological quality and one for agricultural intensification. Soil physical quality is characterized through laboratory analysis of samples taken in the same type of soil under long-term production in state, cooperative, and family farmer cropping systems. Soil structure management in the small farmer system is especially worthy of study, because this agricultural system has developed an intensive agroecological productive model on the basis of low external input use, polycultures and internal nutrient cycling. Favorable policies and farmer organizations are discussed as indispensible elements of sustainable agricultural development. The relationships between soil management, local knowledge, and food access are explored in the Cuban context and as directions for food system studies.

TI  - Research on Farmers' Willingness of Land Transfer Behavior Based on Food Security
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In China, the current household contract responsibility system has been unable to adapt to the commercialization and marketization of rural cultivated land. Rural land transfer is allowed by the government as a supplement to the household contract responsibility system. However, in 2016, the rural land circulating in China accounted for only 35% of the total national rural land area and there were many problems with the process of land circulation. Therefore, the rural revitalization strategy in China must focus on how to promote rural land circulation with high efficiency to ensure food security in China and high quality to realize the sustainable development of rural land resources. In this study, based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), two structural equation models (SEM) for rural land inflow and rural land outflow were used to compare and examine the key factors affecting farmers' intention to engage in rural land circulation in Shandong Province. Data analysed from a survey of 549 farmers showed that behavioural attitudes, subjective norms, and perceptual behavioural control have a significant impact on farmers' intention to engage in rural land circulation, and only subjective norms had a negative impact on the land inflow intention model. Behavioural attitudes had the greatest impact in the two models, but the impact paths of the two models were different. In the rural land inflow intention model, the intrinsic value of cultivated land is important to farmers, whereas in the rural land outflow model, the economic rationality of transferring land was mainly considered. The importance of perceptual behavioural control in the rural land outflow model was greater than it was in the rural land inflow model. The results of this research can provide a reference for formulating government policies, achieving the sustainable development of land resources, and guaranteeing food supply.

TI  - Nexus of energy use, agricultural production, employment and incomes among rural households in Uttar Pradesh, India
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - This study analyzes the nexus issues of energy use, agricultural production, income and employment among heterogeneous and interdependent rural households in Uttar Pradesh, India. We use an agricultural household dynamic programming model that includes two types of households differentiated by their socio-economic characteristics and that are linked through agricultural contracts. Households are also differentiated by their membership in terms of men, women and children. The model simulates the effects of policies such as state subsidies for the purchase of solar panels, improvement in non-agricultural employment opportunities, and combinations of the two, as they are suggested to improve energy supply and reduce trade-offs in energy use. The model results indicate that households improve energy use patterns by using solar panels; yet, adoption of such technology is conditional on state subsidy levels of 50% and 80% for the purchase of solar panels for farming and domestic purposes respectively. Subsidies for solar panels together with improvement of off-farm work increases off-farm employment levels and income of the poorer household, however, this policy reduces agricultural production. In addition, the wealthier household incurs losses from improvement in non-agricultural employment opportunities due to reduced labor availability for farm operations.

TI  - Intrahousehold power inequalities and cooperation: Unpacking household responses to nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions in rural India
T2  - MATERNAL AND CHILD NUTRITION
AB  - Nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) interventions offer a means to improve the dietary quality of rural, undernourished populations. Their effectiveness could be further increased by understanding how household dynamics enable or inhibit the uptake of NSA behaviours. We used a convergent parallel mixed-methods design to describe the links between household dynamics-specifically intrahousehold power inequalities and intrahousehold cooperation-and dietary quality and to explore whether household dynamics mediated or modified the effects of NSA interventions tested in a cluster-randomized trial, Upscaling Participatory Action and Videos for Agriculture and Nutrition (UPAVAN). We use quantitative data from cross-sectional surveys in 148 village clusters at UPAVAN's baseline and 32 months afterwards (endline), and qualitative data from family case studies and focus group discussions with intervention participants and facilitators. We found that households cooperated to grow and buy nutritious foods, and gendered power inequalities were associated with women's dietary quality, but cooperation and women's use of power was inhibited by several interlinked factors. UPAVAN interventions were more successful in more supportive, cooperative households, and in some cases, the interventions increased women's decision-making power. However, women's decisions to enter into negotiations with family members depended on whether women deemed the practices promoted by UPAVAN interventions to be feasible, as well as women's confidence and previous cultivation success. We conclude that interventions may be more effective if they can elicit cooperation from the whole household. This will require a move towards more family-centric intervention models that empower women while involving other family members and accounting for the varied ways that families cooperate and negotiate.

TI  - Does empowering women benefit poverty reduction? Evidence from a multi-component program in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB  - Ending poverty is a top priority of the international development agenda, and governments worldwide have attached great importance to poverty alleviation measures. However, poverty reduction policies have mostly focused on men, which has widened the gap in productivity and income between men and women and increased gender inequality. This paper aims to determine the impacts of a multi-component program on women?s empowerment and poverty reduction, and explore the role empowered women play in poverty reduction. The dataset used in this study was collected in nine poor counties of Ulanqab City in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China at the end of 2014, yielding a sample of 900 households. Recall questions were used to reconstruct the baseline data and build a panel dataset. Smaller groups of rural households were further identified to better target the women in the beneficiary group. To control the selection bias, propensity score matching, inverse probability weighting, and the difference-in-differences matching method were used to analyze the effect of the program and undertake robust checks. The results show that the program has positive effects on women?s empowerment and poverty reduction simultaneously. Empowering women also has positive effects on poverty reduction, and the women who were the beneficiaries have contributed to increasing the incomes and living standards of households. Training, microfinance, and associations are common means or strategies to empower women to address poverty. This paper provides new empirical evidence that women can benefit from a gender-focus program through portfolio intervention such as training, cooperatives, and credit. Empowered women further improve the livelihoods of poor households and help lift them out of poverty. The results suggest that researchers and policymakers need to pay more attention to poverty

TI  - Understanding the factors that influence household use of clean energy in the Similipal Tiger Reserve, India
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
AB  - Biotic pressure in and around protected areas (PA) is the primary cause of biodiversity loss in many developing countries across the globe. The pressure comes partly from biomass energy dependency in the form of heavy extraction of fuelwood from the forests. Although biomass fuels provide easily accessible and affordable sources of domestic energy to the rural masses, their combustion results in environmental and health-related hazards. The objectives of this paper are to assess the patterns of household energy use in a subsistence forest economy and analyze the factors that influence their energy use choice for cooking and lighting. The paper uses primary data collected randomly from 244 households located in and around the Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR), situated in the eastern Indian state of Odisha. Age of the household head, number of days in wage employment, number of adult males and females in a household, education of the household head and landholding size are found to be the major variables that determine household fuelwood collection sources inside the reserve. Considering household structure as an income indicator, the analysis clearly shows that non-poor households prefer to use clean energy (i.e. solar) for lighting, while poor households tend to use solid fuel. Energy policies for development should be based on the realistic proposition that fuelwood will remain the major source of energy for cooking for substantial proportions of the world's population. Promotion of public education, social forestry schemes and fuel-efficient improved chulhas should be encouraged in order to reduce household dependence on fuelwood. Moreover, devolving sufficient property rights over forest resources to local communities may help secure their broad-based and active participation in the decision-making process, which may result in a positive change in the attitude of the local people towards biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Sharecropping in Non-traditional Agro-export Production: The Abougnon Contract for Pineapple Cultivation in Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - This article highlights the role of sharecropping in small-scale, non-traditional export production, through the case of pineapple production in Cote d'Ivoire. The study reveals the diversity of contractual configurations with respect to the same crop, under the same local term of abougnon. Beyond a description of contractual practices, the article explores the rationale for share contracts in a context of imperfect tenancy, labour and credit markets. The analysis of actors' rationales in entering abougnon contracts points out the role of financing constraints and disequilibrium in the tenancy market. It highlights the secondary role played by transaction costs induced by moral hazard, incentives or up to the crisis that struck down the sector production and market risks. This in-depth, localised longitudinal case study relies on first-hand data collected through intensive fieldwork conducted in the village of Djimini-Koffikro in 1983-1984 and 2002-2003, updated in 2010.

TI  - Poverty and disabled households in the People's Republic of China: experiences with a new rural health insurance scheme
T2  - DISABILITY & SOCIETY
AB  - This article discusses what in international literature has commonly been termed the vicious circle' of poverty and disability. Our aim is to shed light on recent policies that attempt to break the vicious circle in rural areas in the People's Republic of China. Drawing on data produced from fieldwork conducted in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China, our approach is to explore experiences that households with people with disabilities have had with a newly implemented rural health insurance reform. The introduction of this reform is significant as lack of insurance and high healthcare expenses are currently perceived as crucial to causing poverty in rural China. We show that people with disabilities have been able to access this new insurance. At the same time, as currently practised, the new insurance does not prevent poor households from sinking deeper into poverty when using healthcare services as healthcare expenses increase.

TI  - Multi-level determinants of crop choice to water stress in smallholder irrigation system of Central Nepal
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Change in crop choice is a common adaptation strategy for global change. However, its drivers are not well understood. We investigate the multilevel determinants of smallholders' crop choice in irrigated agriculture of Central Nepal. We build upon previous studies and consider four levels of determinants: households, irrigation systems, local and regional market systems, and climatic conditions. Using primary survey data of 316 farmers from 9 farmer-managed irrigation systems in the Trishuli-Narayani sub-basin of Central Nepal, among other results, we document that smallholder farmers are likely to choose rice during the monsoon season if they are experienced and farm in the irrigation systems fed by large rivers. Water stress affects the crop choice mainly in two ways. In irrigation systems fed by large rivers, farmers located towards the tail-end of the canal are less likely to plant rice due to water stress. Farmers living in the irrigation systems that are fed by small and medium-size rivers are more likely to choose less water-demanding crops. Market integration is also a key determinant of crop choice. We discuss the implications of our findings for climate-resilient adaptation strategies in Central Nepal.

TI  - Pastoralists and livelihoods: A case study from northern Afar, Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - The changing contexts in the drylands of Africa in which pastoralists operate pose potential negative effects for the livelihood sustenance of pastoralists. We examined present livelihood adaptations among Afar pastoralists in north eastern Ethiopia through a household survey. With an average per capita income of 1.20 USD a day (PPP-adjusted in 2006), all households surveyed in the study area fall below the international 2 USD a day poverty line. Most Afar pastoralists have become increasingly involved in farming and non-farming/non-pastoral activities, but do not display a total detachment from traditional mobile herding. Pastoral households are still less likely to diversify their livelihoods, while semi-pastoral and agro-pastoral households keep livestock more as an additional insurance against failure in other livelihood activities such as farming. This indicates combining livestock production and farming has improved or at least constrained declines in livelihood outcomes. Our quantitative findings are congruent with the general patterns of pastoral livelihood contraction occurring in the region even if a substantial group of pastoralists continue to engage in keeping livestock. These findings are highly relevant in a management context, suggesting more encompassing, and locally adapted policy and development strategy rather than a wholesale abandonment of support to pastoral livelihood styles.

TI  - The effect of membership in producer organizations on women's empowerment: Evidence from Kenya
T2  - WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM
AB  - In developing countries, producer organizations (POs) are important for achieving women empowerment mainly through promoting women's access to the organization's resources and services. However, by improving access to markets and technologies, household membership in POs often results in commercialization of smallholder farming, leading to women disempowerment as men take over control of the farm. We use data from dairy smallholders in Kenya to explore the impact of membership in bargaining and processing POs on women empowerment. Applying the Women Empowerment Livestock Index, we capture six domains of empowerment: production; nutrition; resources; income; opportunities; and workload. We find that when a household joins any PO, regardless of whether the man or the woman in the household is the registered member, women achieve a higher control over production decisions, buying and selling of land and cows, use of loans and receiving dairy income. Distinguishing by gender of membership, there is stronger women empowerment when the woman in the household is a member. We also find that woman membership in bargaining POs results in greater empowerment, in terms of ownership of cows, than woman membership in processing POs. The paper suggests that women empowerment is affected by the functional characteristics of POs.

TI  - The Grootberg lodge partnership in Namibia: towards poverty alleviation and empowerment for long-term sustainability?
T2  - CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM
AB  - This paper analyses socio-economic impacts of a tourism community-public-private partnership in a rural area in Namibia and its contribution to achieving some of the Millennium Development Goals. Building on an institutional analysis as well as an applied sustainable livelihoods approach, it is argued that the Grootberg lodge partnership contributes to nature conservation, poverty alleviation as well as capacity-building and empowerment at both the individual and collective levels (the triple bottom line). Indeed, empirical data gathered in 2006 and 2007 show that the Grootberg lodge has helped to improve the livelihoods of some rural households by distributing to them secure wage revenues, building their financial and physical assets and reducing their vulnerability; it has further provided employees with essential training sessions (human capital) and has involved community members in some of the tourism management decisions. These results, however, remain context related and dependent on some important unpredictable and intangible variables (trust and openness); as a result, further systematic livelihood studies in other contexts are called for in order to better inform policy-makers on the future promotion and development of tourism partnerships both in Namibia and worldwide.

TI  - Direct and spillover impacts of community-based seed production: Quasi-experimental evidence from Nepal
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
AB  - Maize production is central to rural livelihoods in the hills of Nepal. Access to affordable improved maize seed has long been a barrier to productivity gains and livelihood improvement. This study evaluates the direct and indirect (spillover) impacts of a community-based seed production program in Nepal using a quasi-experimental method for selected outcome indicators. Our results show that community-based seed production provides a significant positive direct impact on maize income and female leadership opportunities. The impacts were particularly favorable for disadvantaged households (HHs) from lower castes and HHs that owned less land. There is also strong evidence of spillover impacts on improved seed adoption, yield, and household maize self-sufficiency. Community-based seed production thereby could help Nepal attain cereal self-sufficiency and nutritional security as envisioned in the national agricultural development strategy and seed vision.

TI  - How can poor and disadvantaged households get an opportunity to become a leader in community forestry in Nepal?
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Nepal established community forestry institutions to manage natural resources at a local level with the intention of improving environmental and economic outcomes. While environmental successes have been made under community forestry, economic improvements, particularly for poor and marginalised groups, have proved elusive. This study examines how personal and social attributes influence the membership of the Executive Committee of Community Forestry User Groups (CFUG) in Nepal, and whether there are factors that enable the poor and disadvantaged to gain membership of the Executive Committee of CFUGs. Statistical analysis using data from the middle hill district of Baglung, Nepal indicates that decision-making positions are dominated by the local elite, who are typically from higher castes and relatively wealthy, as measured by land holdings, livestock units, food sufficiency and off-farm income. The results also suggest that leadership experience gained through participation in NGOs provides poor and disadvantaged people the ability to overcome their lower socio-economic status and gain leadership positions within CFUGs. This is an important outcome in that it provides an opening for policy initiatives that encourage the development of leadership skills for the poor and disadvantaged, which in turn will improve representation of these groups.

TI  - Aging population, farm succession, and farmland usage: Evidence from rural China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The aging farming population has a significant influence on production agriculture, succession planning, successors, and farmland usage. Given recent trends in urban migration and increased opportunities for off-farm work, aging farmers increasingly face problems with farmland succession and usage in China. This study investigates the usage of farmland in the absence of a farm successor. Using multinomial logit regression model and data from rural households, we find that aging farmers without successors tend to have options for farmland usage. Specifically, the presence of a grain subsidy increases the likelihood of keeping the farmland in agriculture-albeit by hiring labor or leasing out farmland and decreases the likelihood of pooling farmland into farming cooperatives as shareholders. Off-farm work decreases the likelihood of using hired labor and leasing out farmland. Rich rural households are less likely to keep farmland idle. Large farm operators are more likely to lease out farmland. Finally, rural people with pension plans are more likely to pool their land in land cooperatives - a less-risky option.

TI  - Effects of Fair Trade and organic certifications on small-scale coffee farmer households in Central America and Mexico
T2  - RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - We provide a review of sustainable coffee certifications and results from a quantitative analysis of the effects of Fair Trade, organic and combined Fair Trade/organic certifications on the livelihood strategies of 469 households and 18 cooperatives of Central America and Mexico. Certified households were also compared with a non-certified group in each country. To analyze the differences in coffee price, volume, gross revenue and education between certifications, we used the Kruskal-Wallis ( K-W) non-parametric test and the Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test as a post-hoc procedure. Household savings, credit, food security and incidence of migration were analyzed through Pearson's chi-square test. Our study corroborated the conditions of economic poverty among small-scale coffee farmer households in Central America and Mexico. All certifications provided a higher price per pound and higher gross coffee revenue than non-certified coffee. However, the average volumes of coffee sold by individual households were low, and many certified farmers did not sell their entire production at certified prices. Certifications did not have a discernable effect on other livelihood-related variables, such as education, and incidence of migration at the household level, although they had a positive influence on savings and credit. Sales to certified markets offer farmers and cooperatives better prices, but the contribution derived from these premiums has limited effects on household livelihoods. This demonstrates that certifications will not single-handedly bring significant poverty alleviation to most coffee-farming families. Although certified coffee markets alone will not resolve the livelihood challenges faced by smallholder households, they could still contribute to broad-based sustainable livelihoods, rural development and conservation processes in coffee regions. This can be done by developing more active partnerships between farmers, cooperatives, certifications and environmental and rural development organizations and researchers in coffee regions. Certifications, especially Fair Trade/organic, have proven effective in supporting capacity building and in serving as networks that leverage global development funding for small-scale coffee-producing households.

TI  - Placing Rwanda's agriculture boom: trust, women empowerment and policy impact in maize agricultural cooperatives
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Rwanda has experienced significant economic growth following the 1994 Genocide. This growth is attributed to the expansion of its agricultural sector, specifically farming intensification and the government's focus on creating strong agriculture cooperatives. While Rwanda's economic development has been impressive, many academics have argued that Rwanda's growth comes at the cost of an authoritarian governmental regime, whose policies have too heavy a hand in the daily activities of smallholder farming. This study measures smallholder maize farmer loyalty to their cooperatives using the net promoter scores of five different cooperatives. Results differ from much of the recent research on smallholder farmers in Rwanda in that most cooperative members have high levels of trust in their cooperative leaders. Cooperative members who have high levels of trust in their cooperative president, board and the Government of Rwanda are more likely to recommend their cooperative to friends and family. Furthermore, women cooperative members have higher levels of trust in cooperative leadership, the Government of Rwanda and almost all agricultural input providers mentioned in the study. Findings suggest that cooperative policy, most notably the mandatory inclusion of high numbers of women in cooperative decision-making, is helping to promote strong agricultural institutions as well as sustainable economic development.

TI  - Impact of Agricultural Extension Services on Fertilizer Use and Farmers' Welfare: Evidence from Bangladesh
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Although many studies have assessed the impact of extension, most treat the presence or absence of extension as a binary variable to test treatment effects, and fewer investigate how the type of provider (e.g., govt./private) and the frequency of the contact (number of extension visits) impact farm household welfare. To address this knowledge gap, this article investigates the impact of agricultural extension access, frequency, and provider type on chemical fertilizer application, crop yield, and profit. Data from a nationwide survey in 2015 in Bangladesh, a case country with a heavy over-application of urea fertilizer, are the basis for the endogenous switching regression approach to control for potential self-selection and endogeneity. The empirical results revealed significant differences in the outcomes for farmers who had just one extension contact, more than one extension contact, and those who accessed private provisions. We found that farmers who frequently accessed extension used significantly less urea fertilizer than farmers who accessed extension only once. Farmers who accessed extension more frequently also experienced a statistically significantly higher yield and profit from cropping. Private extension access appeared to result in statistically significantly higher incomes but not reduced urea fertilizer application rates. Our results suggest that a more nuanced understanding can be gained from extension source and frequency treatment effects modelling than with the presence or absence of the extension binary variable formulation that is most common in the literature.

TI  - Do Coffee Farmers Benefit in Food Security from Participating in Coffee Cooperatives? Evidence from Southwest Ethiopia Coffee Cooperatives
T2  - FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN
AB  - Background: Most coffee in Ethiopia is produced by smallholder farmers who face a daily struggle to get sufficient income but also to feed their families. At the same time, many smallholder coffee producers are members of cooperatives. Yet, literature has paid little attention to the effect of cooperatives on combating food insecurity among cash crop producers including coffee farmers.
   Objective: The objective of the study was to investigate how coffee cooperative membership may affect food security among coffee farm households in Southwest Ethiopia.
   Methods: The study used cross-sectional household data on income, expenditure on food, staple food production (maize and teff), and utilization of improved inputs (fertilizer and improved seed) collected from 256 randomly selected farm households (132 cooperative members and 124 non-members) and applied an inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimation to assess the impact of cooperative membership on food security.
   Results: The result revealed that cooperative membership has a positive and significant effect on staple food production (maize and teff) and facilitated technological transformation via increased utilization of fertilizer and improved seeds. Nonetheless, the effect on food expenditure and income could not be confirmed.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest a trade-off between coffee marketing and input supply functions of the cooperatives, impairing their true food security impact from the pooled income and production effect.

TI  - Standards for Development: Food Safety and Sustainability in Wal-Mart's Honduran Produce Supply Chains
T2  - RURAL SOCIOLOGY
AB  - Public-private partnerships between supermarket retailers and development agencies help small-scale producers reach growing domestic markets in developing countries. Drawing on qualitative data that focuses on relationships between producers, development agencies, and Wal-Mart-owned supermarkets in Honduras, the research presented here demonstrates how, by introducing food safety standards to development agencies' outreach efforts, but without necessarily certifying producers or offering a price premium, Wal-Mart uses these standards to simultaneously differentiate production practices by promoting quality, while maintaining a standardized market. As a result, the responsibility and costs for incentivizing growers to change their practices is shifted to nongovernmental organizations. Therefore, although an extensive body of literature describes standards and third-party certification systems as the means for corporations to control production practices, this research indicates that public-private partnerships are a new vehicle by which corporations can influence agricultural production practices. In addition, this article argues that the inclusion of food safety standards in development projects leads to the conflation of food safety and sustainability, without adequately interrogating which agroecological processes food safety standards include and exclude. Therefore, retailers' private food safety standards dominate how sustainability is perceived and practiced in the development context.

TI  - The Effect of Land Inheritance on Youth Migration and Employment Decisions in Rwanda
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - There is growing mobility of rural youth mainly caused by limited access to land resources and inadequacy of job opportunities. Increased population density coupled with low education rates has increased pressure on natural resources, especially land. This paper assessed the effect of land inheritance on youth migration and employment in Rwanda using the 2010/11 and 2013/14 Integrated Household Living Conditions Surveys (EICVs) data collected from 8160 households by the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR). In-depth key informant interviews and focus group discussions, at institutional and cooperative levels, were conducted to supplement and support survey results. We used the Hausman test to choose between the fixed-effects and random-effects models. Results show that land inheritance has a negative and statistically significant effect on youth migration and non-agriculture-based employment. This implies that greater access to land through inheritance reduces the likelihood of youth migration and their participation in nonagricultural employment. The paper concludes with implications for policy aimed at creating increased access to land, expanding youth employment opportunities in rural areas, and reducing rural-urban youth migration.

TI  - Rural-urban migration brings conservation threats and opportunities to Amazonian watersheds
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB  - The spatial distribution and growth of human populations have been overlooked by current debates concerning the impact of rural-urban migration for forest conservation in tropical countries. We investigated human settlement and population change in the Brazilian Amazon, combining government census data with field surveys along rivers. Rural populations were clustered and growing within 300 km of urban centers, whereas depopulation and land abandonment dominated farther from towns. The permanently inhabited extent of rivers contracted by 33 +/- 8 SE% in recent decades, and households farther upriver were more likely to be considering rural-urban migration. However, harvesting of aquatic and terrestrial wildlife by nonresidents continued into headwater regions, hundreds of kilometers beyond the last household on any given river. Policy makers should consider that expanding cities may drive deforestation and overexploitation near towns while unclear property rights threatens overharvesting and unregulated land speculation in abandoned headwaters.

TI  - Land use consolidation in Rwanda: The experiences of small-scale farmers in Musanze District, Northern Province
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The modernization and intensification of agricultural production in Africa has long been a policy goal, for increased productivity and food security. In 2008, the Rwandan government implemented various land and agricultural reforms to transform Rwandan agriculture from subsistence farming to market-oriented production. Central to this agricultural transformation was the Crop Intensification Programme, intended to increase the agricultural productivity of high-potential food crops and encourage land use consolidation, i.e., the joint cultivation of large areas, which was expected to deliver important economies of scale. This programme has been criticized, for example, for authoritarian implementation, negative effects on food security from sole-cropping a few selected crops, and increasing rural socioeconomic differentiation.
   This paper analyses the effects of the land use consolidation programme at the household level, as experienced by small-scale farmers in Musanze District in the Northern Province of Rwanda. The paper draws on 45 individual and 22 collective qualitative semi-structured interviews with small-scale farmers and local key informants in five sectors, conducted in 2013 and 2014.
   The findings show that there is satisfaction, dissatisfaction, and resistance to the programme, especially regarding the selected crops to be cultivated. The programme, including supporting mechanisms, seems to work well for the relatively better-off farmers, who have bigger and scattered land areas, whereas it does not work well for poor farmers with very small plots, which is common in rural Rwanda.

TI  - What Influences Rice Farmers' Choices of Credit Sources in Cote d'Ivoire? An Econometric Analysis using the Multinomial Conditional Logit Model
T2  - PROGRESS IN DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - In Cote d'Ivoire, the low participation of smallholder farmers in the credit market remains a matter of concern. This study examines the key determinants of rice farmers' participation in the credit market. We use a Multinomial Conditional Logit model to consider the characteristics related to the use of different credit sources. A total of 588 rice farmers were randomly sampled from seven rice areas. Our findings reveal that gender, age, education level, experience in rice farming, rice plot size, lowland rice farming, extension contact, membership of a farmer-based organization, marketing of paddy rice, and off-farm income significantly influence the use of different credit sources. While credit requirements such as saving plus collateral, kinship/friendship, membership, favoured client, loan maturity, and the distance between borrowers and lenders are credit source-specific variables that significantly determine rice farmers' choices between different credit sources. These empirical results show that in addition to farmer-specific variables, policymakers should consider the characteristics of credit sources for developing a credit market suitable for smallholder farmers.

TI  - Public policies promoting the informal sector: Effects on incomes, employment and growth in Burkina Faso
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING
AB  - Since the 1990s, Burkina Faso has intensified the implementation of supporting policies to enhance the access to capital and liquidity in the informal sector. This paper analyzes the effects of these public policies on incomes, employment and economic growth by taking into account the interactions between the informal sector, the formal sector and the agricultural sector. For that purpose, policy shocks are simulated through the Partnership for Economic Policy Network?s static computable general equilibrium (CGE) model which is adapted to the structure of a 2008-based social accounting matrix developed by the International Food Policy Research Institute. Our results highlight mixed effects including a paradoxical contraction of the informal sector, the formal sector and economic growth as well as an improvement of the informal households and the farmers? incomes.

TI  - The impact of health insurance on poverty among rural older adults: an evidence from nine counties of western China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB  - Background Older adults are more prone to various diseases. Health insurance becomes effective mechanism to relieve financial burden when the insured is sick. In China, most older adults live in the countryside, and New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme is a kind of health insurance system in rural areas. The relationship between New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme and financial burden due to health expenditure of older adults in China was investigated. This paper aims at the impact of New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme on the poverty among rural older adults. Methods This study employs Probit model and Tobit model to assess the impact of New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme on alleviating poverty among rural older adults based on a survey in nine representative counties in western China. Results The findings show that diseases have significantly negative impact on rural elderly poverty. New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme has impact on alleviating of the health-payment poverty due to catastrophic health expenditure, but the impact is limited. The impact of health insurance on poverty alleviation is greater for men, older adults aged between 60 to 69 and households in in economically poorer area than their counterparts. Conclusions This study show the relationship between New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme and catastrophic health expenditure of older adults in China. The results draw policy attention to introduce different reimbursement expense ratios for different groups to alleviate them from poverty based on more comprehensive insurance packages.

TI  - Effects of agricultural extension system on promoting conservation agriculture in Shaanxi Plain, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Understanding the service quality of the agricultural extension system (AES) and its role in promoting conser-vation agriculture (CA) is crucial to enhancing farmers' response to climate change and improving sustainable agriculture. This study conducted surveys on agricultural information channels accessed by farmers, the perception of farmers and AES workers regarding AES, as well as factors that influence the AES promoting farmers' CA adoption via 363 respondents (262 farmers and 101 AES workers) in the Shaanxi Plain in northern China. Data were analyzed by logistic regression and covariance base structural equation model (CB-SEM). The result showed that farmers trust their neighbors the most as the agricultural information channel, followed by model farmers, village leaders, retailers, and information and communication technology (ICT), while they trust the AES staff the least. Their trust is significantly affected by gender, age, years of education received, household income, and cooperative qualifications. Significant gaps exist in the perception of farmers and AES workers regarding the performance of AES, farmers have significantly lower satisfaction with the availability, accessi-bility, and relevance of AES. AES has no direct effect on farmers' CA adoption, but it indirectly promotes farmers' CA adoption through the mediating effects by farmers' environmental awareness (21.4%) and the chain medi-ating effect of farmers' information exchange and environmental awareness (19.2%). These results suggest that there is still a communication gap between farmers and AES workers, and farmers' information exchange and environmental awareness need to be considered to improve the efficiency of AES and farmers' CA adoption.

TI  - Food or flowers? Contested transformations of community food security and water use priorities under new legal and market regimes in Ecuador's highlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - During the past three decades, the Pisque watershed in Ecuador's Northern Andes has become the country's principal export-roses producing area. Recently, a new boom of local smallholders have established small rose greenhouses and joined the flower-export business. This has intensified water scarcity and material/discursive conflicts over water use priorities: water to defend local-national food sovereignty or production for export. This paper examines how including peasant flower farms in the capitalist dream driven by a 'mimetic desire' and copying large-scale capitalist flower-farm practices and technologies generates new intra-community conflicts over collective water rights, extending traditional class-based water conflicts. New allocation principles in Ecuador's progressive 2008 Constitution and 2014 Water Law prioritising food production over flowers' industrial water use are unlikely to benefit smallholder communities. Instead, decision-making power for peasant communities and their water users' associations on water use priority would enable water user prioritization according to smallholders' own preferences.

TI  - Farmer groups and inorganic fertiliser use among smallholders in rural South Africa
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB  - Smallholder farmers in developing countries are characterised by low uptake of improved farm inputs and weak links to markets. Among other reasons, the high transaction costs that these smallholder farmers incur, as a result of their location in remote areas, inadequate information and missing credit markets, inhibit them from participating in both input and output markets. Organising farmers into groups has been suggested as a potential mechanism for reducing transaction costs. Accordingly, farmer groups have been preferred channels for smallholder farmer support in South Africa, both by the government and donors. However, the impact of these groups on smallholder outcomes such as technology adoption is largely unknown. We investigated the extent to which membership in farmer groups influences the use of improved farm inputs such as inorganic fertiliser among smallholder farmers in South Africa. A sample of 984 households was analysed using the propensity score matching method. Group membership was found to play a positive role in inorganic fertiliser use with a 14% higher chance of inorganic fertiliser use among group members. Among fertiliser users, group members used 170 kg more inorganic fertiliser than did non-members. Further analysis indicated that the effect of group membership on inorganic fertiliser use was heterogeneous among group members. The results suggest that farmer groups play a positive role in the use of improved farm inputs in South Africa. For greater effectiveness of group membership, policymakers should target the less educated, increase the assets of the poor and improve access to extension and information.
   Significance:
   The impact of farmer groups on smallholder outcomes such as technology adoption is largely unknown.
   Farmer groups were found to play a positive role in the adoption of agricultural technologies such as inorganic fertilisers.
   Effect of group membership on inorganic fertiliser adoption was heterogeneous among group members.
   Variables that should be targeted for greater effectiveness of collective action were identified.

TI  - Insights into smallholder capacity for agricultural commercialisation: Evidence from four African contexts
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Over the last 15 years, the agricultural economics and development literature has amply highlighted success stories of smallholder farmers in developing countries, illustrating their increased engagement and integration with markets, in other words, higher rates of commercialisation. Yet, this seeming 'success' should not detract from the large proportion of farmers who, through engaging in high-value market chains, face high risks that often limit the extent of their engagement. This study, across four African contexts in Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, strives to better understand smallholder participation in agricultural commercialisation. Using new detailed cross-sectional household-level data, from the Agricultural Policy Research in Africa (APRA) consortium, collected over 2017-2018, we analyse assets as a determining factor for localised patterns smallholder commercialisation. Applying asset-based thresholds, we capture commercialisation 'capacity'-an indicator of the household's commercialisation potential and ability to respond to risks. Despite the possibility to increase commercialisation as well as institutional arrangements that may reduce risk, such as contract farming, benefits from linkages with medium-scale farmers or returns from specific crop types, we find that households may yet be constrained by lower capacity. Hence, the need for targeted support for those at the margins and with limited assets; with the most pronounced and significant constraints for lower capacity households in study areas in Tanzania. These results can better inform development policies for agriculture where it is important to be able to specifically target households rather than a one size fits all approach.

TI  - Resilience capacities and implications for food security in Zimbabwe
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS-AFJARE
AB  - There is an emerging body of studies assessing the influence of resilience on household food security in developing countries. Yet no study has systematically analysed this theme in Zimbabwe, an area that we address. Data was collected from 331 randomly selected farm households in four districts of Zimbabwe. Factor analysis was used to compute resilience capacities. Poisson regression was used for model estimations. Assets, market diversity and social capital increased dietary diversity by 7.5%, 3.6% and 2.9% respectively. Interventions that enhance asset accumulation, for example income -generating activities, should be promoted. Promoting farmer groups and collective actions are important to strengthen social capital. Adaptive and absorptive capacity increases dietary diversity by 5.9% and 5.4% respectively. Household resilience is positively associated with dietary diversity. The public and private sectors and civil society need to promote interventions that build adaptive, absorptive, and overall resilience capacity of farming households to enhance food security.

TI  - Contract-farming in Staple Food Chains: The Case of Rice in Benin
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - In this paper, we analyze the impact of smallholder participation in a contract-farming scheme in the rice sector in Benin. We use data from a cross-sectional farm-household survey and different propensity score matching estimations to reveal how participation in a contract-farming scheme affects smallholder rice production. We find that contract-farming results in expansion of the rice area, intensification of rice production, increased commercialization of rice, and higher farm-gate prices, and ultimately contributes to rice output growth and increased income. Our findings imply that contract-farming can contribute to upgrading the rice supply chain and the development of the rice sector in Benin. Promoting and supporting the spread of contract-farming schemes in the sector might be an effective way to contribute to reaching the government goals of expanding rice production to become self-sufficient and improving rice quality to compete with imported rice. While there is a large empirical literature on contract-farming in high-value and commodity export sectors, studies on contract-farming in staple food sectors are very scarce. Our results document that contract-farming for staple food crops can be sustainable and benefit smallholder farmers; which is against theoretical expectations that contracting for staple food crops is not feasible because of contract-enforcement problems that stem from a low value of produce, low storage and transport costs, and a larger number of buyers in the chain. Our study contributes to understanding the role that contract-farming might play in the much needed upgrading of domestic and staple food crop sectors in developing countries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Do youth farmers benefit from participating in contract farming? Evidence from French beans youth farmers in Arusha, Tanzania
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - Contract farming (CF) is often seen as a system that enhances production efficiency leading to increased agricultural productivity and improved farmer livelihoods. However, there is a conflict in the literature on its impact on young farmers who are involved in farming in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper evaluates the impacts of CF on crop yield, crop and household income among the youth farmers involved in French bean farming in Tanzania using cross-sectional data of 273 households. The study employs an endogenous switching regression (ESR) model that accounts for observed and unobserved factors to estimate the impact of CF. Further, the propensity score matching (PSM) model is used to check the robustness of ESR results. The results indicate that 162 farmers had contracts and French bean yields and incomes significantly increased with CF. Specifically, the empirical results reveal that CF leads to a gain of 17%, 34% and 37.5% in the yield, crop income and household income. Participation and impact of contract farming differed according to different socio-economic/institutional variables, such as access to extension services.

TI  - Evaluating the Heterogeneous Impacts of Adoption of Climate-Smart Agricultural Technologies on Rural Households' Welfare in Mali
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Climate change is negatively affecting agricultural production in the Sahel region. Climate-Smart Agricultural Technologies (CSATs) are disseminated to reduce these negative effects, and particularly those on resource-poor farm households. This article investigates the distributional impacts of the adoption of CSAT on-farm households' welfare using a dataset that covers four regions, 32 communes, 320 villages, and 2240 households in Mali. Using an instrumental variable quantile treatment effects model, the paper addresses the potential endogeneity arising from the selection bias and the heterogeneity of the effect across the quantiles of the outcome variables' distribution. The results show that the adoption of CSAT is positively associated with improved households' welfare. The farmers' decision to adopt any CSAT is influenced by access to credit, contact with extension agents, participation in training, access to information through the television, and being a member of any organization such as a cooperative society. Moreover, the effect of the adoption of CSAT on household welfare varies across the different households. In particular, the results show that the impact of the adoption of CSAT on households' welfare is generally higher for the poorest (farmers located at the bottom tail of the distribution) end of the welfare distribution. The findings, therefore, highlight the pro-poor impact of the adoption of CSAT in the rural Malian context, as well as the need to tailor the CSAT interventions toward specific socio-economic segments of the rural population in Mali.

TI  - Off-farm work, land tenancy contracts and investment in soil conservation measures in rural Pakistan
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - This study examines the impacts of participation in off-farm work and land tenancy contracts on the intensity of investment in soil-improving measures and farm productivity. A multivariate Tobit model that accounts for potential endogeneity between the intensity of investment and the off-farm work and tenancy contract variables is estimated for 341 rural households in Punjab province of Pakistan. An instrumental variable approach is also used to analyse the impact of tenancy contract and off-farm work on farm productivity. The empirical results show that participation in off-farm work and tenure security tends to increase the intensity of investment in long-term soil-improving measures. We also find that increases in off-farm work and tenure security exert significant and positive effects on farm productivity.

TI  - Household risk preferences and forestland use right transactions in China: tenure security or price illusion?
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Forestland use right transactions (FURT) are mechanisms developed by China's central government to cope with the problem of fragmented forestlands stemming from Collective Forest Tenure Reform (CFTR). We hypothesize that the rate of FURT remains surprisingly low after the CFTR because of households' decision-making behavior, which depends on individual attitudes toward risks and benefits, namely risk preference. Game experiments were used to measure individual risk preferences in 301 rural households in Fujian Province, China. The results show that risk and loss averse households are less willing to participate in FURT, whether for renting-in or renting-out forestlands. When it comes to FURT contract choice, risk and loss averse households prefer to choose informal oral agreements with relatives and friends for short-term, relatively low, one-off payments. Our results also indicate that perceptions of secure forestland tenure could promote household's renting-in of forestlands and weaken the negative impact of household risk preference. Meanwhile, risk and loss averse sellers generally give relative high price evaluations on their forestlands, which inhibits their possibilities to successfully rent-out. This study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between household risk preference and FURT decisions, and will help inform the design of alternative policies that could promote FURT in China.

TI  - Doing Family in "Times of Migration": Care Temporalities and Gender Politics in Southeast Asia
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS
AB  - The prevailing labor migration regime in Asia is underpinned by rotating-door principles of enforced transience, where low-wage migrant labor gains admission into host nation-states based on short-term, time-limited contracts and where family reunification and permanent settlement at destination are explicitly prohibited. In this context, we ask how migrant-sending families in Southeast Asian "source" countries-Indonesia and the Philippines-sustain family life in the long-term absence of one or both parents (often mothers). Through temporal concepts of rhythm, rupture, and reversal, we focus on how temporal modalities of care for left-behind children intersect with gendered power geometries in animating transnational family politics around care. First, by paying heed to the structuring effects of rhythm on social life, we show how routinized care rhythms built around mothers as caregivers have a normalizing and naturalizing effect on the conduct of social life and commonplace understanding of family well-being. Second, we explore the potential rupture to care rhythms triggered by the migration of mothers turned breadwinners and the extent to which gendered care regimes are either conserved, reconstituted, or disrupted in everyday patterns and practices of care. Third, we examine the circumstances under which gender role reversal becomes enduring, gains legitimacy among a range of poly care rhythms, or is quickly undone with the return migration of mothers in homecoming. The analysis is based primarily on research on Indonesian and Filipino rural households conducted in 2017 using paired life story interviews with children and their parental or nonparental adult caregivers.

TI  - Improving the speed of adoption of agricultural technologies and farm performance through farmer groups: evidence from the Great Lakes region of Africa
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - The article examines the effect of membership in farmer groups (MFG) on adoption lag of agricultural technologies and farm performance in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. We use duration and stochastic production frontier models on farm household data. We find that the longer the duration of MFG, the shorter the adoption lag and much more so if combined with extension service delivery. Farmer groups function as an important mechanism for improving farm productivity through reduced technical inefficiency in input use. We discuss policy implications under which farmer groups are a useful channel to reduce adoption lag, and the means through which improved farm performance can be achieved.

TI  - Impacts of climate change on food security and agriculture sector in Malaysia
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study attempts to analyze the short- and long-run impacts of the probable change in rainfall and temperature simultaneously on food availability and access to food issues, as the two dimensions of food security, in Malaysia. It uses an integrated method comprising of a stochastic method and a computable general equilibrium model using the latest (2010) input-output table published in 2015. The stochastic method, which relates to the Monte Carlo simulation, provides the probable changes in rainfall and temperature patterns and their probability of occurrence based on historical data of rainfall and temperature and crop productivity. It was found that, simultaneous variation of rainfall and temperature, in both the short- and long-run, contracts the economic performance of Malaysia. Findings also show the negative impact of rainfall-temperature variability, in both time periods, on food availability and access to food due to a reduction in the supply of agricultural products, a commodity inflation pressure and a reduction in household income. Moreover, results suggest that the climate variability shocks lead to a reduction in the consumption and welfare of all household groups, particularly in rural areas.

TI  - Indigenous governance structures for maintaining an ecosystem service in an agro-pastoral community in the Indian Trans Himalaya
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE
AB  - The majority of the global terrestrial biodiversity occurs on indigenous lands, and biodiversity decline on these lands is relatively slower. Yet, robust understanding of indigenous governance systems for biodiversity and ecosystem services remains a key knowledge gap. We used the socio-ecological systems framework to study the governance of ecosystem services (ES) by an indigenous community in the Village of Kibber in the Trans-Himalayan Mountains of India. Focusing on plant-biomass removal from communal pastures, we identified the main factors shaping local governance using in-depth focal and deliberative group discussions with community members. Notwithstanding inequities of caste and gender, we found that Kibber had a well-functioning, complex, relatively democratic and inclusive system, with all households of the village involved in decision-making related to ES governance. Robust systems of information sharing, monitoring, conflict resolution, and self-organization played an important role. We found the role of institutional memory sustained by the oracle to be critical in maintaining governance structures. Our work underscores the potential resilience and importance of indigenous systems for the governance of ecosystem services.

TI  - Edible forest? Rethinking Nepal's forest governance in the era of food insecurity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - The problem of food insecurity is growing, triggering global debates on the gap in understanding alternative ways of accessing foods, including those from forestlands. This paper aims to address this gap by demonstrating a variety of ways in which forests carry the potential to contribute to food security, drawing on the case study of community based forest management in Nepal. It shows that forests not only complement farms in providing foods in critical periods, but also provide an important platform for collective actions, which have the potential to enhance smallholders' entitlement to food. The paper, then, identifies barriers in the current policy framework to capitalize on the potential of forests to enhance food security. An important implication of this finding is that there is an urgent need to reframe forest governance to incorporate food security concerns, without necessarily compromising forests' role in biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Disparities in economic achievement across the rural-urban divide in Pakistan: Implications for development planning
T2  - ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY
AB  - Growth, underpinned by augmented production, has been the dominant mode of development, where the focus is to influence the ability to increase the output and income of producers. In this process, differences in economic achievement are influenced collectively by geography, culture and institutions that determine effective capabilities. Yet, disparities associated with place are still widespread. In this paper, we draw some insights on the nature of economic deprivation amongst Pakistan households using Household Integrated Economic Survey (PSLM/HIES) data and treating the residential location as a key parameter of interest. In relating to the well-known discussion on rural-urban divide, we identify some commonalities in location-specific attributes in the achievement of economic-wellbeing. The analyses confirm the existing knowledge that poverty and well-being have strong place attachments, favouring urban areas as locations of greater relative well-being due to low levels of deprivation, in particular health, education and food security. In discussing how location may predispose inhabitants to deprivations or vulnerabilities, we identify some opportunities to realign development focus towards meeting local needs and raising aspirations for self-empowerment by better focusing on the nature of economic linkages that supports livelihood diversity.

TI  - Forest-poverty nexus: Exploring the contribution of forests to rural livelihoods in Kenya
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
AB  - This paper explores the contribution of forests to the livelihoods of local communities in Kenya. The paper uses survey data to explore resource extraction and the economic reliance of households on forests. The results suggest that both rich and poor households depend on forests, and that membership in forest user groups, and therefore participation in forest activities, may be based on a household's monetary rather than asset income. The results imply that forests support the living standards of the poor through the diversification of household income sources. The econometric results point to the role of household heterogeneity in private resource endowments in influencing dependence on forests. Participation in collective action and farm size are also significant determinants of forest dependence. The results call for a balanced policy approach to forest management that facilitates both access to forests by poor households and forest conservation.

TI  - Interplay between economic empowerment and sexual behaviour and practices of migrant workers within the context of HIV and AIDS in the Lesotho textile industry
T2  - SAHARA J-JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ASPECTS OF HIV-AIDS
AB  - Economic empowerment brings with it a wide range of consequences, both positive and negative. The objective of this paper was to examine the relationship between economic empowerment and the sexual behaviour and practices of migrant workers within the context of HIV and AIDS in the Lesotho textile industry. Data for this paper were extracted from the findings of a larger study which had been conducted concerning HIV and AIDS in the textile industry in Lesotho. Using in-depth interviews, data were collected from 40 participants who were purposively selected from five factories which had been chosen randomly. Empowerment theory was used as a lens to provide meanings for the experiences of the participants. The findings show that the participants were empowered only in certain respects in terms of Kabeer's empowerment model of 'power to' and 'power within', on one hand, and in terms of Malhotra's comprehensive empowerment framework at the household level, on the other, as being employed in the industry enabled them to participate in the economy. Employment in the sector provided the participants with the means to be able to acquire basic needs and the ability to participate in household decision-making: for the female participants, the ability to make independent sexual decisions was also enhanced. These improvements were greeted enthusiastically, particularly by the female participants, given their previously disadvantaged status as a result of coming from rural patriarchal villages with gender-defined hegemonic notions of respectability. The findings also indicate that environmental factors and others, such as meagre salaries, encouraged some of the female workers to engage in transactional sex, while some of the male participants tended to increase their sexual relationships as a result of acquiring employment and income from the industry. It is the contention of the authors of this study that true empowerment requires both vital resources and individual and collective participation, particularly for the women, who are more vulnerable than men. Finally, we conclude that the opportunities provided by economic empowerment have given the participants a new social meaning for their situation and an awareness about their place in power relations.

TI  - Does the devolution of forest management help conserve mangrove in the Mekong Delta of Viet Nam?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - In the decentralization of forest management, the state devolves forestland use right to communities. What if the state devolves the right directly to individual households, not to communities? Does this policy work and within this policy what devolution mechanism works better in terms of forest conservation? This paper addresses these questions using the context of mangrove forest in Viet Nam. Mangrove forest areas in Viet Nam have experienced a substantial decline during the last century. Since 1994, a devolution policy has allowed mangrove forests to be assigned to households for protection and management. Households were allowed to convert part of the mangrove forest areas into other uses that bring private benefits. It is not clear whether the devolution policy provided sufficient incentives to households for not over-converting mangrove forest.
   We collect and analyse commune-level data and household-level data. At commune level analysis, we used fixed effects instrumental variable (IV) regression to examine whether the devolution of forestland right to households helps conserving mangrove forest areas of communes. At household level analysis, we apply Tobit IV regression to evaluate the performance of two devolution mechanisms with regard to farms? mangrove coverage as well as household violations of the regulatory level of mangrove coverage. Our analyses indicate that the devolving forestland right from state to households increases forest coverage. We find that comparing to the land use certificate, the contract-based allocation of forestland from the state to households results in higher level of forest cover and less violation of coverage regulation. Interestingly, increasing coverage regulation result in higher actual mangrove coverage and higher violation. Higher payment that households received from the devolved forestland right would improve forest coverage. Market conditions, such as market prices and alternative livelihood, do not affect mangrove coverage and household?s violation of regulation. The findings indicate that the current devolution policy should be redesigned to more effectively conserve mangrove forest.

TI  - The implications of rural perceptions of water scarcity on differential adaptation behaviour in Rajasthan, India
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - Water scarcity is one of the most critical issues facing agriculture today. To understand how people manage the risk of water scarcity and growing pressures of increased climate variability, exploring perceptions of risk and how these perceptions feed into response behaviour and willingness to adapt is critical. This paper revisits existing frameworks that conceptualise perceptions of environmental risk and decision-making, and uses empirical evidence from an in-depth study conducted in Rajasthan, India, to emphasise how individual and collective memories, and experience of past extreme events shape current definitions and future expectations of climatic risks. In doing so, we demonstrate the value of recognising the role of local perceptions of water scarcity (and how they vary between and within households) in constructing social vulnerability. This expanded understanding of risk perception is critical for incentivising individual adaptation and strengthening local adaptation pathways.

TI  - Dowry and Intrahousehold Bargaining Evidence from China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES
AB  - This paper analyzes the relationship between a woman's intrahousehold bargaining position and her welfare within marriage using household data front rural China. Simultaneity problems are overcome by using dowry to proxy for bargaining position. Omitted variable bias is addressed by using grain shocks in the year preceding marriage as an instrument for dowry. Instrumented dowry positively impacts numerous measures of a wife's welfare, including household purchases, the time allocation of household members. and the woman's satisfaction with life, offering strong evidence it? support of collective models of the household.

TI  - Woodlot management and livelihoods in a tropical conservation landscape
T2  - AMBIO
AB  - In biodiversity hotspots, there is often tension between human needs and conservation, exacerbated when protected areas prevent access to natural resources. Forest-dependent people may compensate for exclusion by managing unprotected forests or cultivating planted woodlots. Outside Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda, household wood product needs are high and population growth puts pressure on the environment. We investigated the role of privately and collectively managed woodlots in provisioning wood products and supporting local livelihoods. We found that households relied heavily on woodlots for daily needs and as resources during time of need. We also found that locally relevant social institutions, called stretcher groups, played a role in the management of woodlots, providing shared community resources. Privately and collectively owned woodlots support local livelihoods and wood product needs in the region. Long-term management of forests in Uganda should consider the value of woodlots and the mechanisms required to support them.

TI  - The nexus between gender, collective action for public goods and agriculture: evidence from Malawi
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Across the developing world, public goods exert significant impacts on the local rural economy in general and agricultural productivity and welfare outcomes in particular. Economic and social-cultural heterogeneity have, however, long been documented as detrimental to collective capacity to provide public goods. In particular, women are often underrepresented in local leadership and decision-making processes, as are young adults and minority ethnic groups. While democratic principles dictate that broad civic engagement by women and other groups could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of local governance and increase public goods provision, the empirical evidence on these hypotheses is scant. This article develops a theoretical model highlighting the complexity of constructing a fair schedule of individual contributions, given heterogeneity in costs and benefits that accrue to people depending, for instance, on their gender, age, ethnicity, and education. The model demonstrates that representative leadership and broad participation in community organizations can mitigate the negative impacts of heterogeneity on collective capacity to provide public goods. Nationally representative household survey data from Malawi, combined with geospatial and administrative information, are used to test this hypothesis and to estimate the relationship between collective capacity for public good provision and community median estimates of maize yields and household consumption expenditures per capita. The analysis shows that similarities between the leadership and the general population in terms of gender and age, and active participation by women and young adult in community groups, alleviate the negative effects of heterogeneity and increase collective capacity, which in turn improves agriculture productivity and welfare.

TI  - Monetary and Non-Monetary Poverty within Urban Locals and Rural Migrants in China using Inequality-Sensitive Poverty Measures
T2  - B E JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS & POLICY
AB  - This paper measures monetary and non-monetary poverty among urban local and rural migrant groups in the urban labour market in China, capturing incidence, intensity and inequality of poverty. To measure non-monetary poverty in multiple dimensions the chosen indicators are education, health status, health insurance and pension insurance. Using data from the China Household Income Project for the years 2002, 2007, and 2013, it appears that although monetary poverty in both groups is low, migrants have higher levels of non-monetary deprivation for various levels of poverty thresholds. Compared to the urban locals, the rural migrants experienced relatively less severe poverty than mild or moderate poverty during 2002 and 2007. Our Shapley decomposition exercise on non-monetary poverty measure reveals that the incidence contributes most to the urban-migrant gap, and the contribution of intensity is higher than that of inequality. The most important factors in multidimensional poverty for both groups are health insurance and pension insurance in all years. Our logit analysis shows that the effects of demographic characteristics, level of contract, occupation, and the industry have different impacts on these two groups.

TI  - Gaming for smallholder participation in the design of more sustainable agricultural landscapes
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Smallholder farming systems often consist of a mosaic of interlinked forested and cleared-field patches that together provide a diversity of services to local and non-local stakeholders. Designing and adopting more sustainable farming systems for such mosaic landscapes involves communal decision-making and active participation of local smallholders. Currently, a wide variety of participatory approaches to involve individual farmers in such design processes is available. However, methodologies that address communal decision-making processes as seen in complex smallholder agricultural landscapes are still rare. Here, we present a gaming methodology developed to (i) actively involve farmers in the process of agroecosystem design, and (ii) to identify factors and patterns of communal decision-making through an in-depth analysis of game strategies deployed by participants. At the basis of this methodology is the RESORTES board game; a stylized yet complex land-use game rich in ecological and social outcomes. Results of four pilot sessions in a usufruct community in the buffer zone of a Man and Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico, showed that the game sessions created an open and active discussion among participants. Discussions concerned land-use issues in the game and in real-life. It allowed participants that were new to active involvement in communal decision-making to openly discuss and share their ideas. The highly structured monitoring and analysis scheme for ex-ante/ex-post analysis was easy in use and identified communication, leadership and relatedness among participants as influential factors that smoothened the collective decision-making process. The RESORTES board game and related games can shed light on farmer's actual views on and responses to multifunctional agricultural landscape planning and the land sharing vs. land sparing dilemmas currently in debate in academic and policy-making settings. The findings of this paper can be useful to inform strategies for community involvement in agroecosystem design in a broader set of complex socio-environmental context, using serious game to guide agricultural landscape planning processes.

TI  - Backup Agreement as a Coordination Mechanism in a Decentralized Fruit Chain in a Developing Country
T2  - GAMES
AB  - This paper aims to analyze the impacts of a backup agreement contract on the performance of a small agricultural producers' citrus supply chain. A backup agreement contract, which ensures for each echelon that a quantity of products will be bought independently of real demand, is proposed to coordinate a three-echelon supply chain, aimed at improving income. After presenting an overview of the literature that shows various coordination mechanisms but no backup agreement proposals for supply chain coordination, this paper develops a decentralized three-echelon supply chain facing stochastic customer demand and includes the backup agreement as a coordination mechanism to guarantee a balanced relationship between the chain members. The model is tested in a real case study in Colombia, and a sensitivity analysis is provided. Results show that a backup agreement contract coordinates the small agricultural producers' supply chain and improves income for each echelon, especially for the small producer. However, the economic mechanism complexity can limit coordination among echelons, mainly because of a lack of trust and consolidated supply capacity from small farmers. The foregoing requires the development of an associative structure by small producers, which is proposed as future research work.

TI  - Land Consolidation in Rural China: Life Satisfaction among Resettlers and Its Determinants
T2  - LAND
AB  - The Chinese government has pursued rural land consolidation under the Building New Rural Communities (BNRC) initiative. The consolidation projects aim to address the hollowing village problem, improve the living standards of rural dwellers, and promote urban-rural integration. Rural villages with small populations and poor infrastructure are merged into a centralized rural community, and their inhabitants are resettled. The newly vacated buildings are then converted to agriculture land, which allows cities to expand under the "no net loss" land-use policy. Despite the significance of the initiative, both in terms of the scale of operation and the impacts on the affected households, there are few empirical studies that scrutinize this form of rural restructuring. Drawing on data collected via surveys and interviews, this paper examines the processes of land consolidation and its impacts on villagers. From a development-as-modernization perspective, we outline three main processes of land consolidation: village mergers and resettlement, land circulation to rural cooperatives, and rural industrial development. Overall, the effects of land consolidation on the livelihood of resettled villagers are positive. This system generally improves housing and living conditions through increased levels of off-farm employment and income, but there are a number of barriers that may hinder a villager's ability to find different employment. Housing and neighborhood characteristics have significant effects on the life satisfaction of villagers.

TI  - Class dynamics in contract farming: the case of tobacco production in Mozambique
T2  - THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
AB  - This paper examines the class relations emerging in a contract farming scheme in Mozambique. Debates in the literature about contract farming characterise this market arrangement as leading to farmers losing control over production at the hands of capital. By discussing both the drivers and impacts of changes in the division of property and labour, this paper reveals a complex class structure in which the pressure of merchant capital on farmers is internalized within households and transferred onto workers and sharecroppers. This challenges the pertinence of conventional policy that prescribes empowering contract farmers without considering their varied class positions and interests.

TI  - Basic capability effect: Collective management of pastoral resources in southwestern Kenya
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Collective action, such as common resource user groups, has gained importance in the management of pastoral natural resources. This study aims at analyzing the effects of basic capabilities, among other factors, on households' decisions to participate in collective management of pastoral resources in Narok County, Kenya. A zero inflated beta model, in addition to alternative econometric model specifications, is applied on cross-sectional data collected through a household survey. The results confirm the key role of the capability concept in explaining the management of natural resources. Increased basic capabilities, that is, the ability to achieve some minimally acceptable levels of functioning reduce cooperation levels in collective management of pastoral resources. Social capital, neighborhood social influences, resource system characteristics, socioeconomic factors and institutional factors also emerge as key determinants of collective management of pastoral resources. Policy implications drawn by this study encourage strategies to build social capital and facilitate adoption of improved range management technologies where communal management of land is likely to be abandoned for exclusive property rights.

TI  - Predicting the impacts of land management for sustainable development on depression risk in a Ugandan case study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Agricultural intensification and expanding protected areas are proposed sustainable development approaches. But, their consequences for mental health are poorly understood. This study aims to predict how forest conservation and contract farming may alter resource access and depression risk in rural Uganda. Residents (N = 695) in 11 communities in Masindi District were asked about their expectations under land management scenarios using scenario-based interviews, household characteristics and depression symptoms. Over 80% of respondents presented with a 'business-as-usual forest access' scenario expected reduced access to forest income and food over the next decade; this number climbed above 90% among 'restricted forest access' scenario respondents. Over 99% of those presented with two land access scenarios ('business-as-usual land access' and 'sugarcane expansion land access') expected wealthy households to gain land but poorer families to lose it, threatening to increase poverty and food insecurity among small-scale farmers. Bayesian structural equation modelling suggested that depression severity was positively associated with food insecurity (0.20, 95% CI = 0.12-0.28) and economic poverty (0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.19). Decision-makers should evaluate the mental health impacts of conservation and agricultural approaches that restrict access to livelihood resources. Future research could explore opportunities to support mental health through sustainable use of nature.

TI  - Climate change-induced livelihood adaptive strategies and perceptions of forest-dependent communities: The case of Inanda, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Many South African rural communities depend directly or indirectly on natural forests to meet their livelihoods. Climate change can alter many of the mutual relationships between rural communities and natural resources (forests) by posing a variety of new challenges to these resources, agriculture, biodiversity, rural livelihoods and food (in) security. This study aimed to assess how forest-dependent rural communities perceive climate change and how that perception and other socio-economic factors affect their adaptation. In doing so, it identifies the barriers and enablers to adaptation in response to changes in the community forest status that threaten their livelihoods. The study employed a multinomial logit (MNL) model to analyse how socio-economic and institutional factors influence their choices among the alternative livelihood strategies. The study reveals that factors such as the capacity of community forests to support rural community livelihoods, awareness of community members about the change in temperature and rainfall, and the trend in the availability of natural forest products play important roles in enhancing adaptation capabilities. In addition, households with better knowledge about the trend in temperature and rainfall and also those endowed with human capital are less likely to create pressure on natural forests. Taking forests and their services as impure public goods, the study recommends the need for public-private partnerships (between local municipalities/government and/or non-government entities and the private sector) to invest in building institutions that improve community forest governance, capacity empowerment on collective management of common-pool resources, and creating employment and livelihood opportunities to forest-dependent rural communities.

TI  - Dark and bright spots in the shadow of the pandemic: Rural livelihoods, social vulnerability, and local governance in India and Nepal
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented disruption to lives and livelihoods around the world. These disruptions have brought into sharp focus experiences of vulnerability but also, at times, evidence of resilience as people and institutions gear up to respond to the crisis. Drawing on intensive qualitative enquiry in 16 villages of Himalayan India and Nepal, this paper documents both dark and bright spots from the early days of the pandemic. We find intense experiences of fear and uncertainty, heightened food insecurity, and drastic reductions in livelihood opportunities. However, we also find a wide range of individual and collective responses as well as a patchwork of policy support mechanisms that have provided at least some measure of basic security. Local elected governments have played a critical role in coordinating responses and delivering social support, however the nature of their actions varies as a result of different institutional arrangements and state support systems in the two countries. Our findings highlight the changing nature of vulnerability in the present era, as demographic shifts, growing off-farm employment and dependence on remittances, and increasing market integration have all brought about new kinds of exposure to risk for rural populations in the context of the present disruption and beyond. Most importantly, our research shows the critical importance of strong systems of state support for protecting basic well-being in times of crises. Based on these findings, we argue that there is a need for greater knowledge of how local institutions work in tandem with a broader set of state support mechanisms to generate responses for urgent challenges; such knowledge holds the potential to develop governance systems that are better able to confront diverse shocks that households face, both now and in the future.

TI  - Assessing Rural Household Food Security using Sustainable Livelihoods Framework in Western Iran
T2  - AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - This study aimed to assess rural household food security status in the villages of Kermanshah County using sustainable livelihoods framework by an exploratory sequential mixed-methods approach. In this research, qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analyzed in two separate phases. In qualitative research, change agents and the Delphi technique are employed to identify and classify these factors and prioritize the effects of them on the food security status of rural households. In the second phase, the theoretical basis for the structural model in the quantitative investigation, based on sustainable livelihoods framework, and the results of the qualitative section were added to the model. Bayesian structural equation modeling is used in model presentation. The results indicate that among the food security dimensions, stability (0.738) and among the sustainable livelihood framework factors, social capital (0.316) have the greatest impact on food security status. Moreover, the dimensions of natural capital (0.172), human capital (0.133), financial capital (0.081), livelihood strategies (0.075), vulnerability patterns (-0.046), transformative structures and processes (0.019) and physical capital (0.012) are the most effective factors on the food security status of households, respectively. In addition, "participation in cooperative activities with other villagers ", "social integration with other rural members ", "the crime rate in the village, " and "more preference for living in rural area " had the greatest effect on the formation of social capital. Hence, social empowerment, use of diverse cropping pattern and access to education in the region are necessary to improve food security development programs. Enhancing participation in cooperative activities with other rural households and encouraging social integration with members from other villages are the most important recommendations in this research.

TI  - Prevalence and Severity of Burn Scars in Rural Mozambique
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
AB  - Background Burn injuries are common in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and their associated disability is tragic. This study is the first to explore burn scars in rural communities in Mozambique. This work also validated an innovate burn assessment tool, the Morphological African Scar Contractures Classification (MASCC), used to determine surgical need. Methods Using a stratified, population-weighted survey, the team interviewed randomly selected households from September 2012 to June 2013. Three rural districts (Chokwe, Nhamatanda, and Ribaue) were selected to represent the southern, central and northern regions of the country. Injuries were recorded, documented with photographs, and approach to care was gathered. A panel of residents and surgeons reviewed the burn scar images using both the Vancouver Scar Scale and the MASCC, a validated visual scale that categorizes patients into four categories corresponding to levels of surgical intervention. Results Of the 6104 survey participants, 6% (n = 370) reported one or more burn injuries. Burn injuries were more common in females (57%) and most often occurred on the extremities. Individuals less than 25 years old had a significantly higher odds of reporting a burn scar compared to people older than 45 years. Based on the MASCC, 12% (n = 42) would benefit from surgery to treat contractures. Conclusion Untreated burn injuries are prevalent in rural Mozambique. Our study reveals a lack of access to surgical care in rural communities and demonstrates how the MASCC scale can be used to extend the reach of surgical assessment beyond the hospital through community health workers.

TI  - Land tenure security and technical efficiency: new insights from a case study in Northwest China
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - Improving technical efficiency in agriculture can play an important role in meeting present and future demands for agricultural products, at the same time enhancing the long-term sustainability of land and water use. This paper examines the impact of household perceptions of land tenure security on technical efficiency using detailed household-level data collected in Minle County in northwest China. The authors find that the (perceived) tenure security provided by land certificates encourages part-time farming with relatively low technical efficiency. The renting out of land by households with migrant members can only partly make up for this negative effect, because land rental markets are thin and highly fragmented. Therefore, the provision of land certificates to rural households has a negative impact on technical efficiency. For tenure security provided by the expected absence of land reallocations in the near future, on the other hand, the authors find that it reduces temporary migration and thereby contributes to higher technical efficiency.

TI  - Does Adoption of Climate Change Adaptation Strategy Improve Food Security? A Case of Rice Farmers in Ogun State, Nigeria
T2  - LAND
AB  - The southwestern part of Nigeria, particularly Ogun State, is more vulnerable to the vagaries of climate change due to the high dependence on rain-fed agriculture and limited capacities to respond to climate change. In this study, factors influencing climate change adaptation strategies and its impacts on household food security of smallholder rice farmers in Ogun State were estimated. A multistage sampling technique was employed to select 120 smallholder rice farmers in the study area. The factors influencing the adoption of climate change adaptation practices and their impacts on household food security among smallholder rice farmers in Ogun State were examined using a probit model and an endogenous switching probit model (ESPM). According to the results of household dietary diversity score (HDDS), adopters of climate change adaptation techniques have higher levels of food security than non-adopters. The outcome of the ESPM shows that access to market information, access to extension agents, gender, off-farm income, and membership in cooperatives all contribute to the variations in food security experienced by both adopters and non-adopters of climate change adaptation strategies. A unit increase in adoption of climate change adaptation measures will increase household food security by about 3 units while decreasing severity in food insecurity by about 3.2 units. Therefore, it is recommended that policies that would support smallholder farmers' decisions to embrace measures for coping with climate change should be encouraged in order to stimulate their adaptive capacity. Additionally, in order to secure the inclusive sustainability of the agricultural sector, stakeholders and NGOs must collaborate with each other to enhance the circumstances under which farmers may receive climate change information, timely agricultural loans, and policy incentives.

TI  - Decentralization and participation: The governance of common pool resources in Nepal's Terai
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Decentralization has emerged as an important instrument of environmental and development policy in the last two decades. Presumed benefits of environmental policy decentralization depend in significant measure on broad participation in the programs that governments create to decentralize decision making related to resource management. This paper uses data from protected areas in Nepal's Terai to examine who participates in environmental decentralization programs. On the basis of our statistical analysis, we highlight the fact that the likelihood of participation in community-level user groups is greater for those who are economically and socially better-off. We also find that individuals who have greater access to and who visit government offices related to decentralization policies more often are also more likely to participate in user groups created by state officials. Finally, we find a negative correlation between education and levels of participation. Our study and analysis support the argument that for decentralization policies to be successful on equity issues, it is important to build institutional mechanisms that encourage poorer and more marginal households to access government officials, improve access to educational opportunities, and create incentives to promote more interactions between less powerful rural residents and government officials.

TI  - The effect of collective action on smallholder income and asset holdings in Kenya
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Collective action through rural producer marketing organizations can be significant for improving smallholder welfare thus contributing to rural economic growth and poverty alleviation. The purpose of this paper was to examine the impact of farmer group membership on smallholder welfare and poverty. The study compared farmers in producer-marketing organizations and non-members involved in growing mango from the eastern part of Kenya. Propensity score matching method was used to estimate the average treatment effect of group membership on smallholder welfare and poverty. The heterogeneity across propensity score and farm size for the estimated impact were also determined using the smoothing differencing method. A total of 600 households were interviewed comprising of 400 non-members and 200 members. The study shows that group membership significantly improves smallholder total household income and asset holdings, and reduces poverty. This effect is significant for medium-scale farmers participating in collective action as compared to poor small-scale and large-scale farmers. The important factors which determine smallholder participation in collective action include human capital such as age and education level of the household head, market access, natural and physical capital such as total farm size and number of other crops grown. This study expands on the current literature about the effect of collective action on smallholder welfare by investigating the impact on asset holdings and poverty in addition to the total household income.

TI  - The state of food security and its determinants in Ghana: an ordered probit analysis of the household hunger scale and household food insecurity access scale
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB  - The issue of food insecurity has been well documented to be severe in northern Ghana. Several attempts have been made to curb the situation, but the effects of these interven-tions are unknown. Using responses from 405 rural households, this paper estimates the determinants of food insecurity in the Upper East region. Data were analysed using de-scriptive statistics and an ordered probit regression. The Household Food Security Access Scale (HFIAS) and the Household Hunger Scale (HHS) were the two measures of house-hold food security used in the study. This paper validates and compares the two measures used to check whether determinants and status of household food security differ between the two measures. The findings show that the two measures of food security agreed on most of the significant determinants of household food security. Factors such as education of household head, households' farm size, access to credit and access to extension ser-vices were significant determinants of household food security by both measures. Factors such as household size, access to good roads, access to formal cooperative and availability of paid jobs were found to be significant determinants of household food security with the HFIAS, while gender of household head and distance to market were significant deter-minants of food security in the HHS model. The study recommends improved education, social structures such as good roads and markets as well as support services such as credit and extension to combat food insecurity. These key steps should be taken as pillars to the sustainable implementation of Agenda 2063 for a food secure Africa. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Linking Attitudes, Policy, and Forest Cover Change in Buffer Zone Communities of Chitwan National Park, Nepal
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Deforestation in Nepal threatens the functioning of complex social-ecological systems, including rural populations that depend on forests for subsistence, as well as Nepal's biodiversity and other ecosystem services. Nepal's forests are particularly important to the nation's poorest inhabitants, as many depend upon them for daily survival. Two-thirds of Nepal's population relies on forests for sustenance, and these pressures are likely to increase in the future. This, coupled with high population densities and growth rates, highlights the importance of studying the relationship between human communities, forest cover trends through time, and forest management institutions. Here, we used surveys to explore how household attitudes associated with conservation-related behaviors in two rural communities-one that has experienced significant forest loss, and the other forest gain-compare with forest cover trends as indicated by satellite-derived forest-loss and -regeneration estimates between 2005 and 2013. Results found a significant difference in attitudes in the two areas, perhaps contributing to and reacting from current forest conditions. In both study sites, participation in community forestry strengthened support for conservation, forest conservation-related attitudes aligned with forest cover trends, and a negative relationship was found between economic status and having supportive forest conservation-related attitudes. In addition, on average, respondents were not satisfied with their district forest officers and did not feel that the current political climate in Nepal supported sustainable forestry. These findings are important as Nepal's Master Plan for the Forestry Sector has expired and the country is in the process of structuring a new Forestry Sector Strategy.

TI  - Seasonality and food security among smallholder rural households in eastern Ethiopia: Evidence from panel data analysis
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - Food insecurity remains one of the major challenges in Ethiopia. There is scanty empirical evidence regarding the contribution of seasonality to household food and nutrition security. This study was conducted in eastern Ethiopia with the aim of examining seasonal household food and nutrition security and factors influencing this seasonal variation. Data were gathered from randomly selected households during pre- and post-harvest seasons. A Random Effects Generalized Least Squares (GLS) regression was employed for analysis. The result indicated considerable variation between the two seasons in terms of dietary diversity and food security. Households producing more food groups, cultivating larger size of land, having higher household income, keeping more livestock, owning cell phone, having access to cooperatives, and having access to improved drinking water as well as education were more likely to be more food secure across seasons. However, households keeping livestock in their dwelling units and households who had access to credit were negatively associated with seasonal food insecurity. Future interventions aiming at ensuring food security should pay attention to seasonality and mechanisms of improving diversified food production and household income as well as expanding education opportunities and access to cooperatives, infrastructure (mobile telephone), and sanitation.

TI  - The Productivity Effects of Adopting Improved Organic Manure Practices in Nepal
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Owing to farmers' issues on accessibility and affordability of chemical fertilizers in Nepal, organic manure has been advocated as a more environmentally sustainable fertilizer input alternative. Using household survey data from Nepal, we analyze the adoption and productivity effects of improved organic manure practices. Our empirical strategy utilizes a recently developed control function approach in the endogenous switching regression model that allows for substantial heterogeneities accounting for potential self-selection problem due to observables and unobservables. Findings reinforce the crucial role of social capital as farm households' adoption decisions are significantly influenced by 1) having adopter neighbors or friends, 2) residing in proximity to the market, and 3) gaining easy access to agricultural extension services. Beyond environmental and social considerations, this study establishes economic motivations for the adoption decision. The results show that the adoption of improved organic manure practices increased crop yield by 17 percentage points. These practices did not only result in significantly higher yields among adopting farms, but counterfactual analyses indicate that non-adopting farms would have realized much better yield conditions had they implemented the technology. The study concludes with implications for policies and initiatives to expand the adoption and impacts of improved organic manure practices in Nepal.

TI  - How do biosphere reserves influence local vulnerability and adaptation? Evidence from Latin America
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Resource management regulations, such as those associated with the establishment of protected areas, can increase vulnerability and compromise individual and collective agency for adaptation. In this article, we comparatively analyse how four rural communities located within two biosphere reserves in Mexico and Bolivia experience vulnerability and adaptation to global change. We use focus groups, interviews and scoring exercises to analyse the influence of reserve management practices on locally perceived changes and stresses on livelihoods, and to discuss communities' coping and adaptation strategies. We show that both reserves are perceived as a source of stress but somewhat differently. In Mexico, communities feel vulnerable to the reserve's regulations but less to climatic and economic stresses, whereas in Bolivia communities perceive the insufficient enforcement of the reserve's rules as the most relevant stress to their livelihoods. Most of household-based and collective adaptations to environmental change have been adopted without the support of the biosphere reserves. We discuss how and why the biosphere reserves contribute to local vulnerability and why their role in enhancing local adaptation is limited. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Can authoritarian regimes achieve just energy transition? Evidence from China's solar photovoltaic poverty alleviation initiative
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Energy justice is an important concept drawing attention to fairness and equity in the transition to clean energy. Recently, a theme that highlights procedural and distributive injustices of energy transition in authoritarian regimes, particularly China, has emerged in the literature. This study challenges this perspective with an examination of China's photovoltaic poverty alleviation initiative (PVPA)-a policy that aims to ease poverty through a clean energy transition in rural areas. The evidence collected from interviews and surveys shows that a just energy transition has been achieved by the PVPA in two ways. First, from a just procedure perspective, there are institutionalized mechanisms ensuring procedural justice, including public consultation conducted at the village level and the disclosure of information regarding the distribution of benefits. Second, from a just outcome perspective, the PVPA has made a positive material impact on poor rural households, and more broadly, village collectives. These findings show that just energy transitions in authoritarian regimes are possible, but they assume a path in which top-down politics, rather than bottom-up pressure, is the key driving force.

TI  - Horticultural exports, female wage employment and primary school enrolment: Theory and evidence from Senegal
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - In this paper we analyse the indirect effects of the boom in horticultural exports in Senegal on child schooling. The export boom has caused a dramatic increase in female off-farm wage employment, which led to increased female bargaining power in the household. We investigate the causal effect of female wage income on primary school enrolment. We develop a collective household model with endogenous bargaining power to show that, if women have higher preferences for schooling than men, the impact of female wage income on school enrolment will be the result of a positive income effect, a negative labour substitution effect and a positive empowerment effect. We address the question empirically using original household survey data from Senegal. We use different econometric techniques and show that female off-farm wage income has a positive effect on primary school enrolment for both boys and girls, and that female empowerment is specifically important for the schooling of girls. Our results imply that the horticultural export boom in Senegal has indirectly contributed to the second and third Millennium Development Goals of universal primary education and elimination of gender disparities in primary education.

TI  - Does participatory forest management program lead to efficient forest resource use and improved rural livelihoods? Experiences from Mua-Livulezi Forest Reserve, Malawi
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - This study evaluates the efficacy of Improved Forest Management for Sustainable Livelihoods Program in communities adjacent to Mua-Livulezi Forest Reserve, Malawi. The program is specifically aimed at alleviating poverty and enhance rural livelihoods through promoting greater community involvement in forest management while providing access and associated benefits. The study therefore evaluated the effect of the program on community organisation, forest access, forest use, product availability and commercialisation of forest products. The results show that despite the program putting in place strategies for the people to access different products for different uses; forest use is restricted mainly to subsistence use rather than cash income. The main forest product collected by the people for livelihood was firewood, mainly for cooking and heating. This is an indication that forests are an important natural capital for subsistence rather than cash income. Gender, location of the village, and distance to the nearest forest area were significant predictors of households' forest use. Introduction of the co-management program has not brought out the expected outcomes in areas of community organization, forest access, forest product availability and commercialisation of forest products. A multi-institutional approach is recommended to draw upon diverse talents and experiences from individual institutions both government and non-governmental in order to achieve meaningful social change.

AB  - In many low-income, high-risk environments households participate in informal risk sharing institutions involving inter-household transfers. This study focuses on: asset transfers and asset risk; the influence of past behavior on access to transfers; and wealth-differentiated transfer behavior. Panel data on livestock transfers in northern Kenya are analyzed. Three explanations of livestock transfers are investigated: ex post insurance; ex ante precautionary savings; and redistribution. Findings indicate that livestock transfers are of limited effectiveness in addressing asset risk and avoiding poverty. The findings have implications for both research on risk sharing institutions and for the design of development policies in pastoral areas. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Climate-smart cowpea adoption and welfare effects of comprehensive agricultural training programs
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - Agricultural training programs remain one of the primary mechanisms for disseminating modern and climate smart technologies with the aim to improve the welfare outcomes of smallholder farmers. With persistent low agricultural productivity in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA), the content, effectiveness, and mode of delivery of training programs remain a debate. In this paper, we examine the adoption, productivity, and income effects of participating in a novel comprehensive agricultural training program (CATP) involving cowpea farmers in northern Ghana by using the endogenous switching regression (ESR) model. The CATP requires farmers to complete a set of modules on good agronomic practices to gain informal certification. The results indicate that participating in the CATP increases the adoption of climate-smart cowpea varieties, productivity, and cowpea income by 75, 15, and 24% points, respectively, compared to their mean levels. These positive welfare effects of participating in the CATPs confirm the need to increase capacity-enhancing activities in agricultural development projects, and design mechanisms to eliminate barriers to participation among rural farm households.

For example, a dairy marketing management policy was implemented, and concentrated dairy complexes were recommended as options for smallholder dairy farmers. The results of this study show that the policies affected marketing channels at the farm gate. Since then, new dairy complexes have emerged and are becoming the primary marketing channel for milk. The marketing transformation has profound implications for food safety, and has strengthened vertical coordination in the Chinese dairy chain. [EconLit citations: H12, Q02, Q18].

TI  - Site-specific fertilizer recommendations for oil palm smallholders using information from large plantations
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Provision of appropriate fertilizer recommendations to smallholder farmers is becoming increasingly important, for reasons of food security, economic viability, and the need to maintain soil fertility. Oil palm is one of the most important crops in the humid tropics, but smallholder growers (< 10 ha) typically have low yields, largely due to inadequate fertilizer inputs and/or incomplete harvesting. It is difficult to produce appropriate fertilizer recommendations for the smallholder growers, due to their large numbers and small farm sizes. In this work, we developed a way of transferring to smallholder growers the fertilizer recommendations that have been developed for nearby plantation fields using large fertilizer trials. The study site was in West New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea, and transfer of information was done using a geographic information system and maps of plantation fields, smallholder blocks, and soil types. The soil-map-unit descriptions were interpreted, and a unified classification system was derived. Then, fertilizer recommendations that had been made on a field-specific basis for the large plantations were allocated to soil types and thereby to individual smallholder blocks. In this way, block-specific fertilizer recommendations were made for more than 4000 individual smallholders. The procedures used were developed into a conceptual framework which is transferable to other regions. Recommendations can be updated as new information becomes available on smallholder block locations or plantation fertilizer recommendations.

TI  - Design and application of a CA-BDI model to determine farmers' land-use behavior
T2  - SPRINGERPLUS
AB  - The belief-desire-intention (BDI) model has been widely used to construct reasoning systems for complex tasks in dynamic environments. We have designed a capabilities and abilities (CA)-BDI farmer decision-making model, which is an extension of the BDI architecture and includes internal representations for farmer household Capabilities and Abilities. This model is used to explore farmer learning mechanisms and to simulate the bounded rational decisions made by farmer households. Our case study focuses on the Gaoqu Commune of Mizhi County, Shaanxi Province, China, where scallion is one of the main cash crops. After comparing the differences between actual land-use changes from 2007 to 2009 and the simulation results, we analyze the validity of the model and discuss the potential and limitations of the farmer land-use decision-making model under three scenarios. Based on the design and implementation of the model, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) the CA-BDI framework is an appropriate model for exploring learning mechanisms and simulating bounded rational decisions; and (2) local governments should encourage scallion planting by assisting scallion farmer cooperatives and farmers to understand the market risk, standardize the rules of their cooperation, and supervise the contracts made between scallion cooperatives and farmers.

TI  - Gender, agricultural commercialization, and collective action in Kenya
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - With the commercialization of agriculture, women are increasingly disadvantaged because of persistent gender disparities in access to productive resources. Farmer collective action that intends to improve smallholder access to markets and technology could potentially accelerate this trend. Here, we use survey data of small-scale banana producers in Kenya to investigate the gender implications of recently established farmer groups. Traditionally, banana has been a women's crop in Kenya. Our results confirm that the groups contribute to increasing male control over banana. We also analyze nutritional implications. While male control over banana revenues does not affect household calorie consumption, it has a negative marginal effect on dietary quality. We demonstrate that the negative gender implications of farmer groups can be avoided when women are group members themselves. In the poorest income segments, group membership even seems to have a positive effect on female-controlled income share. Some policy implications towards gender mainstreaming of farmer collective action are discussed.

TI  - Increasing the regular use of safe water kiosk through collective psychological ownership: A mediation analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Unsafe water consumption is the environmental risk factor in sub-Saharan Africa contributing most to premature death. In urban slums and dispersed rural communities, where access to safe water is especially limited, water kiosks are a relevant safe water source. However, irregular use challenges their operational viability and may cause discontinuation. The present study investigated collective psychological ownership for the kiosk as a potential factor to increase regular kiosk use. Data were collected cross-sectionally in one urban and two rural kiosk sites through interviews in study households (N = 205) and analyzed by path analysis. Involvement in decision-making related to the kiosks explained collective psychological ownership for the kiosks. Collective psychological ownership, in turn, explained self-reported kiosk use through social-cognitive factors. The results emphasize the importance of community involvement in decisions related to kiosk installation and maintenance because it may contribute to regular kiosk use.

TI  - Rural Finance and Agricultural Technology Adoption in Ethiopia: Does the Institutional Design of Lending Organizations Matter?
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - It has now become almost a stylized fact that sustained agricultural growth is central to rapid poverty reduction and economic development. Yet, world poverty is largely concentrated in the agrarian societies, which have the potential for agricultural productivity growth. This is particularly true for Sub-Saharan African countries, where the gaps between potential and actual yields remain high. Minimizing this gap through the promotion of modern inputs such as fertilizer and modern seeds has been at the core of almost all development strategies in Ethiopia. Among other initiatives, the country has promoted microfinance institutions and member-owned financial cooperatives to alleviate credit constraints of the smallholder farmers. This paper analyzes the impacts of these institutions. Using household survey data and a propensity-score-matching technique, we examine the effects that institutional financial services have on farmers' adoption of agricultural technology in Ethiopia. The results suggest that access to institutional finance has a significant positive impact on both the adoption and extent of technology use. However, when impacts are disaggregated by type of financial institution and farm size, heterogeneities are observed. In particular, financial cooperatives have a greater impact on technology adoption than microfinance institutions, and the results appear to vary depending on farm size and types of inputs. The paper concludes with implications for policies to promote adoption of modern agricultural inputs. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of Intensive Youth Participation in Agriculture on Rural Households' Revenue: Evidence from Rice Farming Households in Nigeria
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - The youth unemployment situation is an essential component of the current agricultural policy agenda of the Federal Government of Nigeria. Deep-rooted debates on finding a lasting solution to this problem using agriculture have been targeted as one of the panaceas. Using data from 207 systematically selected rice-producing households, this study employed the Propensity Score Matching method (PSM) and the Inverse Probability Weighted Regression Adjustment method (IPWRA) to examine the effect of intensive youth participation in agriculture on productivity and household revenue in Nigeria. We found that the key factors influencing the decisions of youth to participate in agriculture intensively include the number of years of farming experience, access to credit, membership in social groups, income, and land access. The PSM results indicate that rice productivity could increase by 1088.78 kg/ha if youth decide to intensively participate in agriculture. The IPWRA results show a positive and significant impact of intensive youth participation in agriculture on productivity and revenue. Therefore, our results suggest that efforts by the government and stakeholders towards encouraging flexible accessibility to credit (low-interest and easy repayment) and land without collateral to young people could enhance their participation in intensive agriculture and could subsequently boost productivity and household revenue.

TI  - The impact of access to irrigation on rural incomes and diversification: evidence from China
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose The objective of this study is to estimate the impacts of access to irrigation on farm income, household income and income diversification. Design/methodology/approach This study employs an endogenous switching regression (ESR) model to address the selection bias arising from both observed and unobserved factors and analyze cross-sectional data collected from Fujian, Henan and Sichuan provinces in China. The authors use the Simpson index to measure household income diversification. The propensity score matching (PSM) model and control function approach are also used for comparison purpose. Findings After controlling for the selection bias, the authors find that access to irrigation has a positive and statistically significant impact on rural incomes and diversification. The treatment effects of access to irrigation are to increase farm income, household income and income diversification by around 14, 10 and 107%, respectively. The positive effects of access to irrigation are confirmed by the estimates of the PSM model and control function approach. Further analysis reveals that the irrigation effects on rural incomes and diversification are heterogeneous between small-scale and large-scale farmers and between male-headed and female-headed households. Practical implications The authors' findings suggest that the government should continue to improve irrigation infrastructure construction in rural China to promote smallholder farmers' water access and at the same time facilitate farmers' access to better agronomic and irrigation information. There exist gender and farm size related income and diversification effects of access to irrigation, and the irrigation access is associated with farm location. Thus, when developing regional irrigation programs consideration needs to be taken of whether the rural farming systems are dominated by male/female household heads and land fragmentation/consolidation issues. Originality/value Although a large body of literature has investigated the effects of irrigation development in rural areas, little is known about the impact of access to irrigation on income diversification. The selection bias associated with unobserved heterogeneities is usually neglected in previous studies. This study provides the first attempt by examining the impacts of access to irrigation on rural incomes and diversification, using the ESR model to address both observed and unobserved selection bias.

TI  - "Dear Brother Farmer": Gender-Responsive Digital Extension in Tunisia during the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Providing farmers with essential agricultural information and training in the era of COVID-19 has been a challenge that has prompted a renewed interest in digital extension services. There is a distinct gender gap, however, between men's and women's access to, use of, and ability to benefit from information and communication technologies (ICTs). The overall purpose of this research is to examine how digital extension can address gender inequality in rural areas in the context of the COVID-19 crisis by designing and evaluating the gendered impacts of a digital extension intervention delivered to 624 farmers (363 men and 261 women) (which included phone distribution, radio and SMS messages, and sharing of information prompts) in northern Tunisia. In order to assess the effectiveness of gender-responsive digital extension that targets husband and wife pairs, as opposed to only men, we employed logistic regression and descriptive statistics to analyze a sample of 242 farmers (141 women and 141 men). We find that phone ownership facilitated women's access to their social network, as well as agricultural information and services, ultimately improving their participation in household decision making and agricultural production. We find that gender-responsive digital extension is effective for men and especially women in terms of usefulness, learning, and adoption. We identified education level and cooperative membership as important factors that determine the impact of digital extension services on farmers and demonstrate the positive impact of radio programming. We recommend strengthening phone access for women, targeting information (including through non-written ways) to both husbands and wives, using sharing prompts, and more rigorous extension for knowledge-intensive topics such as conservation agriculture and rural collectives.

TI  - Land rental, prices and the management of China's grasslands: the case of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
T2  - RANGELAND JOURNAL
AB  - Heterogeneity among China's pastoral households raises the prospect that efficient transfer of grassland-use rights may improve grassland management. More understanding of grassland rental is needed if policy incentives on grassland management are to be refined. Based on a survey of 252 herders in the typical steppe, desert steppe and sandy grassland areas of Inner Mongolia, a significant part of China's overall grasslands, a multinomial logit model was used to explore factors influencing the decision to: (i) rent in grassland, (ii) rent out grassland, or (iii) neither rent in nor rent out grassland. A multiple regression model then investigated the factors influencing the price of this rented grassland, including a focus on the factors of the exchange. The findings suggest that rental has facilitated a level of specialisation whereby households with less own-grassland area, more livestock, more intensive production systems, lower perceptions of degradation, and some off-farm income (but not high levels) being more likely to rent in land. The likelihood was independent of the type of grassland, extent of grazing bans or grassland subsidies received. Similarly, households more likely to rent out land had fewer livestock and some land subject to grazing bans. The specialisation and larger land areas has enabled households renting in land to have lower stocking rates than those of households not renting grassland. However, analysis of rental prices reveals limitations in the rental market, with prices dependent on the form of contract and relationship of the participants in the exchange, as well as on area rented and type of grassland. Thus, improving land transfer may be warranted to facilitate further specialisation and improved grazing management and herder livelihoods.

TI  - Impacts of Supermarkets on Farm Household Nutrition in Kenya
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Many developing countries experience a food system transformation with a rapid growth of supermarkets. We analyze impacts of supermarkets on farm household nutrition with survey data from Kenya. Participation in supermarket channels is associated with significantly higher calorie, vitamin A, iron, and zinc consumption. We use simultaneous equation models to analyze impact pathways. Supermarket-supplying households have higher incomes, a higher share of land under vegetables, and a higher likelihood of male control of revenues. Furthermore, income and the share of land under vegetables have positive impacts, while male control of revenues has negative impacts on dietary quality. Policy and further research implications are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Land rental, off-farm employment and technical efficiency of farm households in Jiangxi Province, China
T2  - NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Land rental market development and off-farm employment have important implications for agricultural production. This study examined the effects of land rental market participation, the resulting land tenure contracts, and off-farm employment on the technical efficiency in rice production in rural China, using the one-step stochastic frontier approach. Data from a survey held at household and plot level in three villages in north-east Jiangxi Province were used to estimate the stochastic frontier model. We found that the mean technical efficiency ofrice production in north-east Jiangxi Province ranged from 0.36 to 0.97, with an average of 0.82. The determinants of technical efficiency show that households that rented land achieved higher technical efficiency than households that did not rent land. Rice production on rented plots was technically as efficient as on contracted plots. Additionally, participation in migration did not have an effect on technical efficiency.

TI  - Does Farmland Tenancy Improve Household Asset Allocation? Evidence from Rural China
T2  - LAND
AB  - In an agricultural society, the farmland is a major form of national wealth and an increase in farmland holding is a sign of wealth accumulation; whereas in an industrial society, the question of whether a rise in farmland holding also increases the wealth accumulation of farmers with the possible choice of being migrant workers is worth theoretical discussion and empirically testing. This article explores the issue of whether farmland tenancy affects household asset allocation in a rapid industrialization period. Using a sample of China's rural households with land contract rights, we employed propensity score matching (PSM) with a difference-in-difference (DID) approach to explore and estimate the impact of farmland tenancy on tenant household asset allocation and test the mechanism of farmland tenancy affecting household asset allocation. Four conclusions are drawn from our study. (1) There is a 'herd effect' in the household decision-making in participation in the farmland rental market and the tenancy of farmland. (2) Household asset choice behavior is adjusted in response to the farmland tenancy for the tenants, increasing the investment in durable goods assets. (3) There is heterogeneity in the effects on asset allocation between tenant households with different intensities in farmland tenancy, presenting relatively more substantial impacts on the change of asset allocation for tenant households with high intensity in the farmland rental market. The tenancy of farmland with high intensity has not only boosted tenants' wealth accumulation but has also increased the investment in agricultural assets and risky asset holdings (both incidence and the share of risky financial assets), while the tenancy of farmland with low intensity has not. Tenancy of farmland does not necessarily bring about an increase in the household's agricultural machinery investment, and only when the area of farmland tenancy reaches a certain scale threshold will households increase their investment in agricultural machinery. (4) The tenancy of farmland has had impact on household asset allocation through a substitution effect instead of an income effect. In general, even though agriculture is not so profitable compared to industry in China, the wealth effect of farmland holding remains significant. This study contributes to the research on household asset allocation from the perspective of farm operation model transition caused by farmland market participation, which helps enhance income and accumulate wealth of rural households in China as well as other developing countries.

TI  - Reducing poverty through use of irrigation: Evidence from rice farming in Benin
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - An emerging body of literature has claimed that poverty is multidimensional and therefore the unidimensional measure cannot serve as a good proxy for poverty. The actual debate is about the inclusion of other dimensions in the poverty analysis framework. Regarding this, the current study examines poverty measurement in rice farming communities in the municipality of Malanville, Benin using both unidimensional and multidimensional poverty indices. It also assesses the effect of involvement in irrigation on multidimensional poverty through an estimation of a two-stage instrumental variable probit model. Results indicate that incidence of monetary poverty was 45.8%. In term of multidimensional poverty, 53.4% of the rice farmers were found to be multidimensionally poor. Overall, the analysis shows lower incidence of poverty for irrigation farmers compared to dry land farmers. We find that the use of irrigation contributes to reducing the likelihood of being multidimensionally poor by 11%. Other determinants include age of the farmer, gender, farm size, use of improved seed, access to credit, off-farm income and market participation. The positive relationship between use of irrigation and poverty reduction justifies the need for irrigation development targeting to implement poverty reduction policies in developing countries.

TI  - Booming markets for Moroccan argan oil appear to benefit some rural households while threatening the endemic argan forest
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Morocco's argan oil is now the most expensive edible oil in the world. High-value argan markets have sparked a bonanza of argan activity. Nongovernmental organizations, international and domestic development agencies, and argan oil cooperatives aggressively promote the win-win aim of simultaneously benefiting local people and the health of the argan forest. This paper tests some of these win-win claims. Analysis of a panel of detailed household data suggests that the boom has enabled some rural households to increase consumption, increase their goat herds (which bodes poorly for the argan forest), and send their girls to secondary school. The boom has predictably made households vigilant guardians of fruit on the tree, but it has not incited investments in longer term tree and forest health. We evaluate landscape-level impacts of these changes using commune-level data on educational enrollment and normalized difference vegetation index data over the period from 1981 to 2009. The results of the mesoanalysis of enrollment are consistent with the microanalysis: the argan boom seems to have improved educational outcomes, especially for girls. Our normalized difference vegetation index analysis, however, suggests that booming argan prices have not improved the forest and may have even induced degradation. We conclude by exploring the dynamic interactions between argan markets, local institutions, rural household welfare, and forest conservation and sustainability.

TI  - Modeling the impact of HIV/AIDS upon food security of diverse rural households in Western Kenya
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Although the impact of HIV/AIDS upon rural smallholder food security in sub-Saharan Africa is understood to be severe and multi-faceted, few empirical studies have undertaken the task of identifying upon which types of households the impact is most severe. In order to understand and examine the impact of HIV/AIDS upon food security of rural households in Western Kenya, an ethnographic linear programming model was developed to simulate household responses to an adult household member contracting HIV. Three male-headed households and one female-headed household with dynamic compositions and representative of the diversity of households in Amukura, Teso District, were simulated. Findings highlighted that the initial stage of HIV infection was the most devastating time for households as HIV infection of an adult member was a shock for which households were ill-prepared. Results further indicated that household food insecurity was more severe in Amukura when an adult female contracted HIV than when an adult male contracted HIV. In particular, household food availability and utilization were more severely reduced when an adult female contracted HIV. Reductions in available female labor critically undermined household food production to a greater degree than reductions in available male labor. This was compounded by the gender division of labor on certain agricultural tasks as well as the inability of adult males to rapidly change their agricultural activities due to labor requirements to maintain long-term investments in sugar cane and animal production. Food access was also reduced under both HIV+ models and was linked to both declining food availability and end-of-year cash. The severity of impact of HIV upon food access depended upon resources available to an individual household. Impacts of HIV upon household agricultural activities in Amukura are therefore dynamic, multiple and diverse. If interventions to counter the impact of HIV on a community are to be successful, there is an urgent need for organizations and governments to adopt holistic approaches to development which appreciate the complexity and diversity of livelihood systems.

TI  - Constraints and opportunities in gender relations: Sugarcane outgrower schemes in Malawi
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Contract farming (CF) is always and inherently a gendered process. This paper unveils the gender dynamics in resource access, use and labour control to show how outgrower CF induces changes, often contradictory engendering processes of production relations. It asks: How does CF influence gender relations in access to land, household labour relations and employment conditions (participation)? Relying on a detailed case study research of a sugarcane CF scheme in Malawi, we show that CF has a complex gendered impact on household's production relations. CF leads to a masculinization of farm management and ownership together with a feminization of labour. Nevertheless, women translate such labour provision into active participation in decision-making over the use of the cash returns from the CF for better outcome in the household. At the individual level, some can benefit from it; especially women who manage to engage in cane farming are able to attain financial independence and increase their bargaining power within their households. However, such benefits are reserved for households with access to land. Nevertheless, women engagement in cane farming coupled with increased gender awareness through NGOs sensitization is contributing to a change in gendered social perceptions and increased valuation of women abilities in commercial farming, their needs and contributions and may be modifying the gender balance at the community level. We demonstrate that empowering women by making them cane farmers alone is not enough to change women position within their communities, unless community members accompany such empowerment with the recognition and acknowledgement of the women's contribution. The finding suggests that combining active women participation in outgrower CF with authority enhancing programs through community education whilst creating the possibilities for women to take independent action may be a good way to improve the gender relations between men and women.

TI  - The effects of agricultural cooperatives on smallholder livelihoods and agricultural performance in Cambodia
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
AB  - Cooperatives are increasingly advocated as a means to improve incomes, livelihoods and the sustainability of smallholder farmers. This study analyzes the impact of commercial vegetable cooperative membership on smallholder agricultural performance in Cambodia. Institutional heterogeneities are considered across cooperatives and various econometric techniques are used to control for potential selection bias. The impacts of horticulture on agricultural outcomes are also analyzed. The results indicate that membership of commercial vegetable cooperatives has so far had no effect on agricultural incomes or the value or amounts of agricultural inputs. However, results indicate that membership has affected technology choice, access to credit services and information transmission through technological training. Additionally, there is evidence that horticulture, as a component of overall agricultural diversification, can augment farm income. The results suggest that much of the benefit of cooperative membership stems from the cooperative's provision of services, which might not be easily inferred from measures of member incomes.

TI  - Ethiopian Agricultural Cooperatives in an Era of Global Commodity Exchange: Does Organisational Form Matter?
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES
AB  - In Ethiopia, agricultural cooperatives are expected to play a key role in linking smallholder farmers to the recently established commodity exchange system. Recent research has found, however, that the commercialisation levels of cooperative members do not differ significantly from those of non-member farmers in Ethiopia. We argue though that the impact of cooperative membership on commercialisation may vary significantly depending on the type of cooperative organisations considered. Applying propensity score matching as well as regression analysis to a set of farm household living in rural areas where the commodity exchange system was to become operational, we consistently find significantly higher commercialisation rates, when compared with non-member famers, for farmers belonging to marketing cooperatives. Livelihood cooperatives, on the other hand, appear to have insignificant or negative impact on Ethiopian farmers' commercialisation. We conclude that the selective inclusion of marketing cooperatives in the commodity exchange system has the potential to simultaneously reduce the rural poverty and maximise agro-commodity commercialisation in Ethiopia.

AB  - This paper investigates the effect of devolved irrigation water management systems and complementary irrigation technologies on collective empowerment in Ethiopia. We find that households' monetary, in-kind and labour contributions for irrigation water provision and appropriation are more common in farmer-managed gravity irrigation schemes compared with farmer-managed pump systems and jointly managed schemes. The most frequent conflict occurrence was observed in jointly managed gravity irrigation systems, followed by farmer-managed gravity systems. Our results indicate that irrigation users' degree of participation, decision-making capacity and strength of local governance are also affected by several household, plot, village, scheme and climatic factors.

TI  - A Typology of the Level of Market Participation among Smallholder Farmers in South Africa: Limpopo and Mpumalanga Provinces
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Smallholder farmers face several challenges that limit their access to markets and prevent them from taking advantage of market opportunities. This study sought to provide observed information on households' involvement in the output market and to analyse the determinants of the level of market participation among smallholder farmers in South Africa. Data (secondary) for this study were collected from a total of 1520 respondents who were selected through stratified random sampling. Descriptive statistics, t-test and a double-hurdle model were used to analyse factors influencing smallholder farmers' decisions regarding participation in the agricultural market. The first-hurdle equation of the double-hurdle model showed that gender of the household, family member working on the farm, wealth index, and agricultural assistance had a positive significant impact on the decision of smallholder farmers to participate in the market, while household age and family member with HIV had a negative significant impact. The results of the second-hurdle model showed marital status, educational level of household, wealth index, and access to agricultural assistance had a negative significant effect on the extent of market participation among smallholder farmers, while household size, household age, and family member with HIV had a positive significant impact. The suggestions emanating from the results as to what factors need to be addressed to encourage smallholder farmers to participate in the market indicate that there is a need for government to hire sufficient and skilled extension workers who understand the market related issues. With the help of extension workers and policymakers, government need to organize smallholder farmers into groups that are easy to manage, train, and support. Smallholder farmers' groups should have their farmers registered, visible, and easily accessible for coordinated government support services. They also need to do more workshops in rural areas to encourage young people to be involved in agriculture. This will lead to sustainable production, alleviation of poverty, improvement of the economy, and food security.

TI  - Land, labor, and rural development: Analyzing participation in India's village dairy cooperatives
T2  - PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER
AB  - Livestock-based livelihoods are currently being promoted by international development agencies as part of global efforts to combat poverty. India's dairy development program, organized around village cooperatives, has become an important model for such efforts. This article aims to identify household characteristics that influence membership in India's rural dairy cooperatives by comparing two villages representing different degrees of success. Utilizing logistic regression methods, data collected through a comprehensive survey of all households in the two villages are analyzed to examine (1) how variables describing animal ownership, agricultural attributes, and household labor availability contribute to explaining membership in the dairy cooperative; and (2) whether factors influencing membership differ across the two villages. Our results indicate that although agricultural property ownership influences cooperative membership in both villages, the kind of dairy animal used and labor utilized for dairying work also have a significant and context-specific effect on household participation. Key Words: agriculture, cooperatives, dairying, land, rural development.

The results indicate that farmer companies perform better when shares are tradable between members, and patrons pay and receive market-related prices for their inputs and products. All directors should be nominated by shareholders and voting should be conducted by secret ballot. To strengthen accountability, the right to hire and fire executive managers should vest with the board of directors and should not be appropriated by government agencies that facilitate these companies. Although directors and managers should monitor shareholder views, they must take policy and strategic decisions themselves as failure to centralize decision-making results in severe influence problems. Farmer company performance is compromised by the absence of well-defined and regularly observed processes to develop and implement strategies, and by inadequate or inappropriate management skills. These management problems may diminish if government facilitators had a clear exit plan from the time the company is established as this would help to focus their attention on the critical task of empowering farmer shareholders to direct and administer their company.

TI  - Smallholder participation and certification of organic farm products in Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Organic and other environmental and social marketing devices seek to connect producers and consumers more directly and reward environmentally and socially superior production systems. Some researchers have observed that these schemes may introduce mechanisms of exclusion, creating an elite group of certified smallholders while putting non-certified farmers at a distinct disadvantage and introducing division among people whose true interest may lie more in relations of solidarity and cooperation The trade and regulatory environment that smallholder coops must navigate is increasingly complex and adaptation to its requirements has important implications for farmer organizations Standards applied to certify smallholder production systems tend to be developed with regard to first-world consumer interests and imposed in a top-down fashion by certification agencies and intermediaries, with little or no farmer participation. Especially in the tropics, agricultural standards that reflect temperate country conditions may place unnecessary burdens on growers who attempt to meet agronomic norms that are irrelevant to local agroecologies. After providing a summary of organic farming and certification in Mexico over the past two decades, we discuss three emerging trends the advent of contract agriculture in organic production, the appearance of a new, environmentally-based coffee certification system intended to favor bird conservation, and a recent government program to support transition to organic production. All three trends involve certain contradictions, both with the foundational social and ecological goals of organic agriculture and with the interests of small farmers. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Impact of contract farming on product quality upgrading: the case of rice in Togo
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose Due to rapid urbanization, rice consumption in Togo has also rapidly increased. Most consumers prefer imported rice over domestically produced rice due to the higher quality of the imported rice. The purpose of this paper is to show that it is possible to upgrade the quality of Togo's domestically produced rice by providing technical and management support in the form of contract farming. Design/methodology/approach Cross-sectional data were collected using a multi-stage sampling technique. An endogenous switching regression model was used for data analysis. Findings The results show that by participating in contract farming, paddy rice quality was upgraded from Grade IV (poor quality) to Grade I (premium quality). The factors influencing this upgrade in the quality of paddy rice grown through contract farming are: the number of extension visits to the farmer, the mode of threshing used by the farmer, and the agro-ecological zone of the farmer. Originality/value This study is original research that contributes to an improved understanding of the impacts of contract farming on the quality of agricultural products produced in developing and emerging economies.

TI  - Cultivation of maize landraces by small-scale shade coffee farmers in western El Salvador
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Small-scale shade coffee agroecosystems have been noted for their potential for tree, bird, and insect biodiversity conservation in the tropics. However, there is a lack of research on other productive areas managed by small-scale coffee farmers such as subsistence maize and bean (milpa) plots, which may be sites of important crop biodiversity conservation, particularly through the on-farm cultivation of native landraces. This study empirically examined the factors that influence farmers' choices between landraces and improved varieties of maize, how seed type interacts with management decisions, and how yields of local maize landraces compare with improved varieties on the farms of small-scale shade coffee farmers in western El Salvador. We conducted household interviews and focus groups with the membership of a 29-household coffee cooperative and tracked management and maize yields in the 42 milpa plots managed by these households. Farmers planted both a hybrid improved variety and five local maize landraces. ANOVA and Pearson's chi-square test were used to compare household characteristics, management, agroecological variables, and yields between plots planted with landraces and plots planted with the improved variety. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the strongest drivers of farmers' choice between landrace seed and improved seed. Analyses indicated that use of maize landraces was associated with higher household income and steeper plot slope. Landrace maize and improved maize were not managed differently, with the exception of synthetic insecticide use. There was no yield advantage for improved varieties over landraces in the 2009 growing season. Farmers appear to prefer local maize landraces for milpa plots on more marginal land, and continue to cultivate landraces despite the availability of improved seed. The farms of small-scale shade coffee farmers could have substantial conservation potential for crop genetic diversity, and the seed-saving and exchange activities among such farmers should be supported.

TI  - RURAL WOMEN AND THE AGRARIAN REFORMS IN PERU, CHILE AND CUBA
T2  - REVISTA ANDINA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS
AB  - This contribution reproduces one of the first articles analyzing rural women's participation in the Peruvian agrarian reform, published in 1983, along with a new preface by the author. It is argued that processes of socio-economic change are not gender neutral; supposedly gender-neutral reforms may have a negative impact on the position of women. Neither the Peruvian nor Chilean agrarian reforms of the 1970s had an explicit policy to incorporate women into the reform, in contrast to Cuba in this period, where the participation of women in the new production cooperatives was a policy goal. As a result, few women were direct beneficiaries in Peru or Chile in comparison to Cuba. The criteria for being a beneficiary of the reform was the main mechanism of exclusion in the former two countries, specifically, the requirement that these be household heads. The exclusion of women had negative consequences for the success of the production cooperatives. In Cuba, women became cooperative members on their own account; moreover, attention to their domestic responsibilities in the new agrarian communities that were created, along with the support of and effective coordination between the peasant's and women's associations, largely explain both how women came to be over one-third of the members and the early success of the cooperativization process.

TI  - Do rural clan-based networks reduce the risk of a return to poverty? Evidence from China
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Avoidance of a return to poverty is a priority within postpoverty alleviation programmes in rural China. As traditional social networks, clan-based networks have long played a pivotal role within rural society and governance. However, few studies have examined their influence on the return to poverty of rural families. Therefore, we used the China Family Panel Survey (CFPS) data from 2014 to explore how clan networks influence the risk of a return to poverty among rural households and its mechanisms. Our findings suggest that clan networks can reduce the risk of returning to poverty and that they have heterogeneous effects on families and regions with different characteristics. Their main function is to reduce the borrowing cost through an external support mechanism and to promote movements of the rural labour force to urban areas where they can earn higher nonagricultural stable incomes through an internal sharing mechanism. This study of the role of traditional clan-based networks in poverty avoidance can contribute to their enhanced role in the new era, while also providing inputs for consolidating and expanding poverty alleviation, innovating existing follow-up poverty alleviation guarantee mechanisms and promoting comprehensive rural revitalization.

TI  - Land use decisions: By whom and to whose benefit? A serious game to uncover dynamics in farm land allocation at household level in Northern Ghana
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Globally, 38% of the land area is agricultural land, of which 45% are located on drylands, mainly in Africa and Asia, constituting the basis for about 60% of the world's food production. Of all farms worldwide, 83% are smallholder farm systems, whose livelihoods depend on effective land management and allocation. While land is often cultivated by the various members of a farm household, land allocation decisions depend on the approval, the ambition and the abilities of influential household members, likely affecting all other household members, too. While intra-household decision-making processes have been described to depend on the interplay of prevailing interests and power positions, so far knowledge on interests and power positions is based on individual reports rather than actual observations. With the aim to explore the process of land allocation in a socially complex smallholder farm system, we invited members of a smallholder community in Northern Ghana to join a closed, experimental serious game, simulating a negotiation process between a male household head (HHH), a wife and the eldest son of a hypothetical local farm household. We observed an integrative negotiation style, resulting into high levels of satisfaction with the negotiation process and outcome by all parties, who reported a high level of similarity between simulated and real-life negotiations. Power was observed to be actively deployed, withheld or passively overruled depending on decision domains and process dynamics. While the HHH was the key decision maker acting as a strategic gatekeeper in a funnel-like process, the wife and the son had a significant influence on 'his decision' i.e. the household-level negotiation outcome. Model-based analysis also showed that the household-level outcome was more profitable as well as agro-biologically and nutritionally more diverse and productive as compared to the HHHs' suggestion. The proposed game proved to be a culturally adequate, simple, cost and time effective tool to capture how household-level land use decisions may come about and whose interests they represent. Our study provides a powerful framework for further research and for policies to foster more equitable land use decisions and therewith more sustainable socio-ecological systems.

TI  - Widows: agents of change in a climate of water uncertainty
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - The African continent has been severely affected by the HIV and AIDS pandemic and as a consequence, development is being obstructed. Agriculture and food production systems are changing as a result of the burden of the pandemic. Many farming families are experiencing trauma from morbidity and mortality as well as facing labour losses and exhaustion. To further exacerbate the situation, climate variability and change reduce the available water supply for domestic and productive uses. This article describes how these multiple stressors play out in Nyanza province in Western Kenya and explores livelihood responses to water stress in Onjiko location, Nyanza. In this community, widows and divorced women affected by HIV and AIDS have become agents of positive change. Data from local surveys (2007), mapping of seasonal calendars (September 2009) and numerous focus group meetings and interviews with women in Onjiko (October 2008, January 2010, January 2011), reveal that despite a negative fall-back position, widows are improving their households' water and food security. This adaptation and even mitigation to some of the experienced climate impacts are emerging from their new activities in a setting of changing conditions. In the capacity of main livelihood providers, widows are gaining increased decision making and bargaining power. As such they can invest in sustainable innovations like rain water harvesting systems and agroforestry. Throughout, they worlc together in formalized groups of collective action that capitalize on the pooling of natural and human resources as well as planned financial management during hardship periods.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19-induced rural-rural migration on agricultural productivity in Delta State, Nigeria
T2  - SCIENTIA AGROPECUARIA
AB  - This study was embarked on to unveil the impact of COVID-19-induced migration on agricultural productivity in Delta State, Nigeria. This survey study involved rural arable crop farmers. Data were collected from households and community survey of 517 families through structured interview schedule (questionnaire administered by face to face interview). It was found that 41% and 30% of the present and second generations respectively, in receiving communities were immigrants. In receiving communities, 68% of the households were of the largest ethnic group compared to 95% fraction in sending communities. Households in sending communities had smaller farm sizes than those in receiving communities. In sending communities, 41% and 65% of the migrant and indigenous populations, respectively, contacted the disease, while there was no recorded case in receiving communities. The mean yield in receiving communities was higher than that in the sending communities. COVID-19 incidents and other factors influenced immigration to receiving communities. The soil and land factors in receiving communities also contributed to decision on migration. Migration increased agricultural productivity in receiving communities, while productivity was reduced in sending communities. However, other factors such as distance to farm, farm size, age of household head and assets also affected yields in sending and receiving communities. The policy implications are that government ought to have considered the fact that, naturally, farm families work while giving distances to themselves in farms. Communities need to participate in decisions on issues like this in the future to collectively, fathom a way out especially in rural communities.

TI  - Farmers' Participation in Knowledge Circulation and the Promotion of Agroecological Methods in South India
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB  - In the context of widespread agrarian distress in rural India, finding ways to secure livelihood sustainability of small farmers have become urgent concerns. Agroecological methods (AEMs) are considered by some to be effective in solving structural problems with farmers' production processes engendered by the use of resource-intensive technologies. AEMs generally require extensive participation by farmers for further development through on-farm experimentation and collective learning. This article studies learning through the lens of knowledge circulation between farmers and "experts" in a local innovation system. In particular it analyzes farmers' participation in knowledge circulation using network data on problem-solving knowledge flows to and from an innovative south Indian village. The findings suggest that farmers' participation was restricted by formal and informal institutions governing the knowledge interactions between the development organizations that promoted AEM and the farmers. Any new ways of working (technological and institutional innovations) are argued to be filtered through the sediments of extant techno-institutional context, leading to the profusion of hybrid forms of technology and organization. However, despite this profusion, or perhaps because of it, epistemological and sociocultural hierarchies continue to operate in avowedly participatory projects organized to promote AEMs based on farmers' "traditional knowledge."

TI  - Structural and Institutional Heterogeneity among Agricultural Cooperatives in Ethiopia: Does It Matter for Farmers' Welfare?
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper analyzes how structural and institutional heterogeneity among irrigation cooperatives shapes the impact of membership on farmers' welfare in northern Ethiopia, using a novel heteroskedasticity-based identification strategy. More specifically, we estimate how cooperative characteristics influence members' income and poverty level. We find that stricter water use regulations have income-enhancing and poverty-reducing effects for farmers. We also find that farmers benefit more from membership in larger, younger, and bottom-up cooperatives initiated through grassroots collective action. Our findings have implications for irrigation development in Ethiopia and call for a better deliberation of organizational heterogeneity in cooperative impact studies

TI  - Has Rural E-Commerce Increased Potato Farmers' Income? Evidence from the Potato Home of China
T2  - POTATO RESEARCH
AB  - Rural e-commerce has achieved an effective interface between rural specialty industries and large markets. This paper explores the impact of rural e-commerce on the income levels of potato farmers based on field survey data. In addition, the extent of the impact of rural e-commerce on the income levels of potato farmers in the participating and non-participating groups was further explored under the counterfactual assumption. The main findings are as follows. (1) Rural e-commerce can increase the income of potato farmers. Participation in rural e-commerce can increase farmers' income in both the participating and non-participating groups. If the participating group had not previously sold potatoes through rural e-commerce, their per capita household income would have been reduced by 27.22%. Similarly, if the non-participating group had sold potatoes through the rural e-commerce platform, their per capita household income would have increased by 36.35%. (2) Under the counterfactual assumption, the impact of rural e-commerce on the incomes of farmers who have not yet sold potatoes through e-commerce platforms is more profound. The marginal income increasing effect of rural e-commerce is currently at an incremental stage, and selling potatoes through an e-commerce platform can lead to higher returns for farmers. (3) Gender, farm household differentiation, self-employment experience, arable land area, position in village and whether participating in agricultural associations or cooperatives are important factors that simultaneously influence farmers' e-commerce participation decisions and income levels. Education and health level can influence farmers' e-commerce participation decisions. Age, farming years, dependency ratio and accessibility to irrigation can influence farmers' income level.

TI  - Does Internet use help reduce rural cropland abandonment? Evidence from China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Currently, food and nutrition insecurity remains a major problem for developing countries. Reducing cropland abandonment is one of the keys to ensuring food security. Thus, this study employs survey data from 8031 farm households in 27 provinces in rural China and builds a theoretical analytical framework of "information and communication technology (ICT) -> farm household -> land use" under the guidance of information economics theory. Furthermore, this study explores the quantitative impacts of the Internet use of farm households on cropland abandonment using an endogenous switching regression (ESR). The results reveal the following: (1) regarding spatial distribution, there is an opposite trend of spatial area aggregation between the Internet use of farm households and cropland abandonment; (2) regarding a quantitative relationship, Internet use can help reduce farm households' cropland abandonment by 43.20%; and (3) Internet use has heterogeneous impacts on cropland abandonment in different groups. The results of this study may link ICT and land use change and provide a new reference for developing countries to ensure food and nutrition security.

TI  - Tourism Contribution to Poverty Alleviation in Kenya: A Dynamic Computable General Equilibrium Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH
AB  - The aim of this article is to investigate the claim that tourism development can be the engine for poverty reduction in Kenya using a dynamic, microsimulation computable general equilibrium model. The article improves on the common practice in the literature by using the more comprehensive Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) index to measure poverty instead of headcount ratios only. Simulations results from previous studies confirm that expansion of the tourism industry will benefit different sectors unevenly and will only marginally improve poverty headcount. This is mainly due to the contraction of the agricultural sector caused the appreciation of the real exchange rates. This article demonstrates that the effect on poverty gap and poverty severity is, nevertheless, significant for both rural and urban areas with higher impact in the urban areas. Tourism expansion enables poorer households to move closer to the poverty line. It is concluded that the tourism industry is pro-poor.

TI  - Linking Smallholder Farmers to Markets, Gender and Intra-Household Dynamics: Does the Choice of Commodity Matter?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Linking smallholder farmers to markets and making markets work for the poor is increasingly becoming an important part of the global research and development agenda. Organizations have used various strategies to link farmers to markets. These approaches have mainly been evaluated for their potential to increase participation in markets and household incomes. The evaluations have assumed a unitary household where income and resources are pooled and allocated according to a joint utility function. In most households, however, income is rarely pooled and neither are resources jointly allocated. This article uses data from Malawi and Uganda to analyze what influences income distribution between men and women, focusing on the type of commodity, type of market and approaches used. The results indicate that commodities generating lower average revenues are more likely to be controlled by women, whereas men control commodities that are high revenue generators, often sold in formal markets.

TI  - Rural land system reforms in China: History, issues, measures and prospects
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Land system reform (LSR) helps to protect farmers' rights and interests and national food security. China is a country dominated by agriculture but insufficient arable land resources. The contradiction between man and land is prominent. To alleviate the man-land contradiction, the Chinese government has carried out a series of LSRs, especially in the past half century. Extensive and in-depth studies have been done on the process and stage characteristics of China's LSRs, but the systematic analysis on the necessity, problems and key measures to deepen the land system reform is still insufficient. Based on a systematic review of the history of the evolution of China's LSRs, this study firstly analyzed the key issues and new challenges existing in or arising from China's land system, then put forward the necessity of deepening the reform of land system, and discussed specific measures taken to deepen the reform of land system in China at present and finally pointed out the future LSR's direction. The results show that China's rural ISR has gone through five stages in general since 1949. The key problems existing or arising from the current land system in China include unclear subject of land property right, serious inefficient utilization of land resources, rapid farmland conversion and conflict between farmers' interests and land system. The dual land system in urban and rural areas has severely restricted the integration of social and economic development in this country. The Chinese government is actively promoting the reforms of rural agricultural land, collective operating construction land and homestead to further remove the dual institutional barriers that hinder the establishment of an integrated land trading market. The vision is good, but there is still a long way to go for China's LSR. The direction of China's rural LSR is to make the property rights relationship clearer, the farmland rights more complete, the transfer transactions more market-oriented and the property rights' protection more equal. Deepening the rural LSRs is helpful to improve the efficiency of land resource utilization, safeguard the rights and interests of farmers, promote the coordination of human-land relationship, and inject new vitality and momentum into rural revitalization. Cooperative promotion of land resource capitalization reform and household registration system reform is the key area of land system reform in China in the future.

TI  - PROSPECTS AND CHALLENGES FOR DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL BUSINESS FORMS IN AGRICULTURE OF UKRAINE
T2  - ZAGADNIENIA EKONOMIKI ROLNEJ
AB  - The article summarizes the practice of creation and functioning of small business forms in agriculture of Ukraine, assesses their role and capabilities at the present stage and in the future, identifies priority, desirable directions for further development of society and mechanisms for their provision. The necessity of implementing a consistent policy of entrepreneurial activity expansion in the rural area is substantiated, in the first place by family farming, which is capable to ensure the maximum employment rate of rural population. Due to the above-mentioned processes, agroholdings have narrowed down the ability of the rural population to conduct agricultural entrepreneurial activity.
   It has also been proved that in order to increase the efficiency of agricultural production, the profitability of rural households from the agricultural products production and sale, employment of rural population and the development of the agrarian market's infrastructure, it is necessary to intensify the creation of agricultural servicing cooperatives, especially in sectors where the production of small business forms prevails. It was found that it is extremely important to introduce a permanent state of financial and other support for the development of agricultural servicing cooperatives and small forms of farming in the rural area, focusing on supporting the latter through cooperatives in which they participate.

TI  - Gender and Rural Vitality: Empowerment through Women's Community Groups*
T2  - RURAL SOCIOLOGY
AB  - Rural women are often the main supporters of their families and have been involved in improving the quality of life for households and communities. Sustainable rural development and poverty reduction is linked to empowering women. Community groups are one mechanism for empowering women and fostering economic development in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. For the poor, the ability to organize and mobilize to solve problems is crucial because collective capability assists in overcoming challenges arising from marginalization and limited resources. Even though considerable work has been done on the impact of institutional support for community groups, it is not well documented how the efforts of women's community groups actually lead to improved socioeconomic wellbeing. The results of the study elucidate the positive impact of female group membership as a mechanism for advancing livelihoods and socio-economic wellbeing. Empowering women's groups as micro-institutions of economic and social advancement is a fundamental tool for improving the well-being of women and their children. The findings are intended to help institutions that work with women groups improve the impact and sustainability of these key mechanisms for development intervention.

TI  - CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN SOCIAL NETWORKS AMONG BORANA WOMEN IN NORTHERN KENYA
T2  - NOMADIC PEOPLES
AB  - This work explores informal marro reciprocity networks and formal women's groups among Waso Borana women in northern Kenya, across four variables: livelihood types, wealth ranks, age ranges and literacy levels. Marro exchanges rely on household resources, while women's groups are attractive due to financial benefits available from external sources. We found that all women in our study participate in the informal marro social networks, over-half registered as group members. Women's groups are more popular among the very poor, sedentary households and peri-urban households as opposed to pastoral households. In the marro networks, the use of labour appears to be popular, as opposed to sharing food and cash. The frequency of participation varies with the needs and opportunities of the women. Farming households participate more rarely in exchanges, compared to groups with other livelihood types - an indication of their poverty and the scarcity of resources. The introduction of cash loans turns out to be a challenge and a strength for both networks. The role played by food aid in informal marro networks prompted mixed responses from women. Although the majority of peri-urban and farming households reported that food aid has no adverse impact on marro, the agro-pastoral households perceive that it has a positive impact, while pastoral households reported a negative impact. The growth of women's groups is linked to the attraction of socio-economic opportunities through collective income-generating activities. Membership of a group affords women the chance to start income-generating activities, as well as becoming more aware of their rights at the domestic level.

TI  - Perceived water-related risk factors of Buruli ulcer in two villages of south-central Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summaryBuruli ulcer is a bacterial skin disease, which is endemic in West and Central Africa. The disease mostly affects children and can progress to large lesions primarily located on upper and lower limbs. While current evidence suggests that the causative bacterium, Mycobacterium ulcerans, is hosted in aquatic environments, the exact transmission route is still not clear. In our study, we investigated two endemic villages in the south-central part of Cote d'Ivoire. Framed in a larger research initiative, we mapped households and water sources of Buruli ulcer cases. Additionally, we interviewed people with Buruli ulcer as well as health care workers about water contact patterns and perceived risk factors. Despite drilled wells installed in the villages, the nearby river (Bandama), seasonal ponds, and low-lands are key water resources for the residents. Our research revealed a variety of activities where people get in touch with water that are related to domestic and subsistence work. Environmental, social, and cultural risk factors were mentioned, underlining the complexity on the local level. We conclude that the communities' perspective and their knowledge must be considered in future research to reduce the burden of Buruli ulcer and other neglected tropical diseases.
   BackgroundBuruli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is a neglected tropical skin disease that is primarily endemic in West and Central Africa, including Cote d'Ivoire. Studies indicate that M. ulcerans infections are caused by contact with an environmental reservoir of the bacteria, governed by specific human biological conditions. Yet, the nature of this reservoir and the exact mode of transmission remain unknown. MethodologyTo identify ecologic risk factors of Buruli ulcer in south-central Cote d'Ivoire, we pursued a qualitative study matched with geo-referencing inquiry. Embedded in a broader integrated wound management research project, we (i) mapped households and water sources of laboratory confirmed Buruli ulcer cases and (ii) interviewed 12 patients and four health care workers to assess exposure to surface water and to deepen the understanding of perceived transmission pathways. Principal findingsWater availability, accessibility, and affordability were reported as key determinants for choosing water resources. Furthermore, perceived risks were related to environmental, structural, and individual factors. Despite the presence of improved water sources (e.g., drilled wells), communities heavily relied on unprotected surface water for a multitude of activities. The nearby Bandama River and seasonal waterbodies were frequently used for washing, bathing, and collection of water for drinking and cooking. Many residents also reported to cross the river on a daily basis for agricultural chores, and hence, are exposed to stagnant water during farming activities. Conclusions/significanceOur study in two Buruli ulcer endemic villages in south-central Cote d'Ivoire revealed a wide range of water-related domestic activities that might expose people to an increased risk of contracting the disease. Environmental, biological, social, and cultural risk factors are closely interlinked and should be considered in future investigations of Buruli ulcer transmission. Active participation of the communities is key to better understand their circumstances to advance research and fight against Buruli ulcer and other neglected tropical diseases.

TI  - China's Rangeland Management Policy Debates: What Have We learned?
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
AB  - In China, three major rangeland management policies have caused dramatic social, economic, and ecological changes for pastoral regions in the past 30 yr: the Rangeland Household Contract Policy (RHCP), Rangeland Ecological Construction Projects (RECPs), and the Nomad Settlement Policy (NSP). The impacts of these policies are greatly debated. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of academic perspectives on the impacts of the three policies and the causes of ineffective and negative effects. The findings demonstrate that academics increasingly report negative impacts of RHCP on the ecosystem, animal husbandry, pastoralist livelihoods, and pastoral society. An increasing number of scholars, although not the majority, attribute the negative impacts to improper policy itself rather than incomplete implementation. Regarding the RECPs, most academics believe that policies have improved the rangeland ecosystem but with obvious negative impacts on pastoralist livelihoods and pastoral society; they attribute the problems to incomplete policy implementation. For the NSP, most academics report positive impacts on pastoralist livelihoods and animal husbandry, although recent researchers have identified negative impacts on pastoral society and the ecosystem. Although they are not in the mainstream, more and more academics attribute the negative impacts to improper policy. Finally, we apply the concept of coupled social-ecological systems (SES) to further analyze the outcomes of these three policies and propose a more flexible and inclusive land tenure policy that recognizes the diverse local institutional arrangements; an integrated RECP framework that considers coadaptation between social and ecological systems; and facilitating voluntary choice in nomad settlement and developing innovative approaches to provide social services for pastoralists who would like to remain in pastoral areas. As these three policy approaches are applied in rangeland management and pastoral development worldwide, this paper may provide useful implications for future policy development in pastoral regions on a global scale.

TI  - Interactions of social, natural, and technological subsystems and synergy between development and adaptation to floods around Poyang Lake
T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
AB  - Rural populations in the developing world face great challenges in climate adaptation and human development. Broader development and climate adaptation can potentially enhance each other, and their positive synergies are essential to improve human well-being in less developed rural areas. Such synergies are, however, commonly lacking across developing countries. This paper examines the relationship between climate adaptation and broader development and finds a positive synergy in the Poyang Lake Region (PLR) - an important rice producing area in China that is vulnerable to flood hazards. We further examine household decision-making and link household decisions to rice cropping patterns interpreted from satellite images to explain the micro- to macro- mechanisms that lead to this synergy. The analysis shows that both the broader development context (national economic development and agricultural policy) and specific risk management (levees) are important for creating the positive synergy. Moreover, it is the right interactions of the social, natural, and technological subsystems that enable rural households to make different land-use and livelihood choices in a way that improves rural livelihoods and reduces flood impacts on rural livelihoods. The diverse household choices then collectively lead to preservation of rice production, despite the negative influence from increasing nonfarm work, and decreased flood impacts on agriculture.

TI  - The Association of Women's Participation in Farmer-Based Organizations with Female and Male Empowerment and its Implication for Nutrition-Sensitive Agriculture Interventions in Rural Ghana
T2  - CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN NUTRITION
AB  - Background: Few studies have examined the influence of women's participation in farmer groups on female and male empowerment, which is considered essential to improving nutrition.
   Objectives: The study aimed to 1) assess the empowerment of Ghanaian women farmers, 1 adult male family decision-maker per household, and the household gender equality; and 2) investigate the relation of empowerment and household gender equality with women's participation in farmer-based organizations (FBOs), women's and men's nutritional status, and household food security.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study investigated secondary outcomes using baseline data from a nutrition-sensitive agriculture intervention implemented through FBOs in rural Ghana. Existing FBOs in 8 communities were selected based on 6 criteria (e.g., participation level, readiness to change). Female FBO (n = 166) and non-FBO (n = 164) members together with a male family member (n = 205) provided data on individual and household characteristics; empowerment was measured across 11 indicators with the project-level Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index. Generalized linear mixed models tested the associations of empowerment and household gender equality with FBO membership, nutritional status, and household food security.
   Results: Women's FBO membership was associated with an increased likelihood of women's empowerment [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.25; 95% CI: 1.97, 5.33] and household gender parity (aOR: 2.82; 95% CI: 1.39, 5.84) but not men's empowerment. Household food insecurity, but not nutritional status, was positively associated with women's FBO participation and individual empowerment indicators (financial services). Food insecurity was negatively associated with the women's empowerment indicator related to attitudes about domestic violence [adjusted beta coefficient (alpha beta): -0.78; 95% CI: -1.35, -0.21] and men's overall empowerment (alpha beta: -0.79; 95% CI: -1.58, -0.01).
   Conclusions: Understanding the complexity in which FBO participation, empowerment, nutritional status, and food security are linked is critical in designing interventions that promote gender equality and improved nutrition.

TI  - Household Responses to Cash Transfers
T2  - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE
AB  - This paper exploits the experimental setup of the cash transfer program PROGRESA (Programa de Educacion, Salud y Alimentacion) in rural Mexico to estimate a collective model of the household in order to investigate how parents allocate household resources. We show that household decisions are compatible with the testable implications of the collective model, based on so-called distribution factors, at the beginning of the program but reject them later on. We discuss a number of possible explanations for these findings and provide several arguments, consistent with our model, suggesting that this rejection may indicate that the treatment is not only empowering women but also possibly changing individual preferences.

TI  - From worker to peasant and then to entrepreneur? Land reform and agrarian change in the Saiss (Morocco)
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyze the emerging entrepreneurial practices on family farms in two agrarian reform cooperatives in Morocco. Their emergence can be explained by the constant negotiation of multiple and sometimes even antagonistic logics within these farms in a context of rapid agrarian change and the juxtaposition of capitalistic, entrepreneurial and peasant farms in the same area. Through their engagement as workers or sharecroppers in the different types of farms and as household members on the family farm, the young farmers from the dismantled agrarian cooperatives participate actively in the transformation of farming modes. The porosity of the peasant and entrepreneurial worlds is the main lesson we draw from our study. There is a subtle process of hybridization between the peasant and entrepreneurial modes of farming, resulting in a wide range of profiles. If we only focus on the political discourse, the trend towards capitalistic and entrepreneurial modes of farming seems inescapable. Nevertheless, our study stresses the resistance of peasant modes of farming that can blend with a 'modern' perception of agriculture. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Farmers' adaptation capacities in the eastern rainforest of Madagascar From forest-clearers to environmental managers
T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - Since 1996, contractual forest management involving the local population has been proposed as a solution to deforestation and poverty in Madagascar. This article highlights the way in which two contrasting farming systems can be adapted to conservation constraints without threatening sustainability. The authors show that farmers' adaptation capacities are heterogeneous among local communities and that a knowledge of the factors influencing this variability can help in the design of guidance for farms to enable them to develop sustainably in line with current perceptions of agriculture's role in land management and forest conservation.

TI  - Farmer cooperatives, gender and side-selling behavior in Burundi's coffee sector
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose This study aims to improve our understanding of side selling in farmer cooperatives. Cooperative member side selling, in which farmers divert produce from cooperatives to competitors, threatens coffee cooperatives. This is a problem in Burundi, where many households earn income from coffee and cooperatives serve a collective action function. Design/methodology/approach Using data from a survey of Burundian coffee farmers, we assess the determinants of two types of cooperative member side-selling behavior: selling to both cooperative and non-cooperative buyers and selling solely to non-cooperative buyers. Findings Farmers who sell to both cooperative and non-cooperative buyers are more likely to be male household heads, be more invested in coffee and have larger farms than non-side sellers, among other characteristics. Farmers who only sell to non-cooperative buyers are poorer and less invested in coffee than non-side sellers. Research limitations/implications Additional research is needed to better understand why side-selling behavior differs between groups and to better understand how household head gender influences side selling. In addition, this study lacks qualitative data supporting quantitative findings. Future research should include qualitative methods to better understand motivations for side-selling behavior. Originality/value The study provides important information on what influences cooperative member side selling and focuses on specific types of side-selling behavior that have been largely overlooked. The study focuses on the role of household head gender in side selling, which is important, given the centrality of women to African agriculture.

T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Based on 1251 household surveys collected in photovoltaic (PV) poverty alleviation areas in rural China, this paper explores the effects of PV cognition including ecological values, perceived behavioural control and social factors on household energy use behaviour by using binary logit regression. The results indicate that: (1) off-farm employment is an important factor influencing household energy choice by reducing the probability of using traditional fossil fuels and increasing the probability of using clean energy; (2) life skills or literacy training and farmers' cooperatives are beneficial to promoting the use of solar energy, and democratic participation and power supply stability can also promote the use of clean energy, so as to reduce the use of traditional fossil fuels; (3) ecological values and perceived behavioural control have no significant impact on the use of solar energy but show significant positive effects on energy-saving behaviour.

TI  - Institutional bricolage and the (Re)shaping of communal land tenure arrangements: Two contrasting cases in upland and lowland Northeastern Laos
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This article examines the factors shaping communal land tenure and livelihood practices in two villages in Houaphan province, Northeastern Laos. It employs the concept of institutional bricolage to show how local actors combine communal tenure, state intervention, donor programs and local power relations to (re)shape formal rules and day-to-day land tenure and livelihood practices. In particular, it highlights how state territorial strategies in lowland and upland rural spaces have differently shaped state interventions in communal land use and access, producing hybrid forms of communal land management rules and practices. The two cases highlight different processes by which communal tenure is eroded or adapted in the process of state incorporation, raising questions about competing authorities over land and the interests and objectives of different actors in land administration. The village cases illustrate how local communities' (in)ability to shape, adapt, and reproduce institutional rules and arrangements pertaining to access and use of communal land is closely interlinked with: 1) how farm households perceive communal land tenure in relation to their livelihood options and farming strategies; 2) how power relations among local communities and between local communities and state actors shape decision making processes and distributional outcomes; and 3) the role of the state in sustaining and advancing its control over land and how this changes over time.

TI  - Feminization of agriculture, relational exchange, and perceived fairness in China: A case in Guangxi province
T2  - RURAL SOCIOLOGY
AB  - This study examines the inconsistency between the unequal allocation of family labor and a lack of perceived unfairness among spouses of male-outmigrant couples in rural Guangxi, China. It explores relational (versus transactional) exchange processes conditioned by husband-wife mutual dependence. Using both qualitative and quantitative data collected in three villages, this study finds that among male-outmigrant couples the gendered division of labor-"men work and women plough"-serves as a collective strategy to cope with poverty. Consequently, instead of engaging in direct exchange using privatized resources, marriage partners indirectly reciprocate each other through culturally prescribed family roles. Relational exchange emphasizes the equality of obligations and nonmarket strategies, which are likely to strengthen relational harmony by enhancing marriage partners' appreciative feelings of each other's contributions to the well-being of the family, thus promoting perceived fairness despite the uneven allocation of family tasks.

TI  - Fairtrade Certification and Livelihood Impacts on Small-scale Coffee Producers in a Tribal Community of India
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES AND POLICY
AB  - Can Fairtrade certification improve farmers' livelihoods in small-scale coffee farming tribal communities in India? Has Fairtrade contributed to capacity-building among the farmers? To answer these questions, household data of 256 coffee farmers from a tribal coffee-producing community in southern India was collected in 2010. Using the propensity score matching technique, the empirical findings show that Fairtrade certification has a positive impact on farmers' income. However, the incidence of poverty in the community is very high, with 84% of the certified farmers being extremely poor. Some improvement in the livelihoods of certified farmers has occurred from higher and assured farm gate prices, regular collection of coffee from the village centers that reduces travel costs, and from the social Fairtrade premium. But while the benefits are modest and the process is slow, challenges remain in terms of improving the effectiveness and management of the cooperative system, as well as raising the awareness of farmers about Fairtrade certification. There is a need to strengthen the positive impacts created by Fairtrade certification by collaboration between the cooperative and local government to enhance the technical, financial and human capacities of the coffee cooperative members.

TI  - Are Technology Adoption and Collective Action Important in Accessing Credit? Evidence from Milk Producers in Tanzania
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - One of the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 2 is to double agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers through, among other things, improving access to financial services including credit. However, designing appropriate mechanisms for increasing access to credit by poor households remains a challenge, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper argues that technology adoption and collective action could provide pathways to enhancing access to credit. Evidence from milk-producing households in Tanzania suggests that group membership increases the probability of borrowing and the amount of funds borrowed by households, while adoption of artificial insemination increases the amount of funds borrowed. Two major conclusions are that public policy for increasing rural households' access to credit should promote collective action, and that the likely increase in amount of funds demanded by households due to technology adoption and collective action will require policy to address issues pertaining to credit rationing of rural households.

TI  - Poverty Reduction Effect of New-Type Agricultural Cooperatives: An Empirical Analysis Using Propensity Score Matching and Endogenous Switching Regression Models
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB  - Agricultural cooperatives have been found to effectively alleviate poverty in developing countries because of their specific socioeconomic functions that allow poor households to overcome marketing and production constraints. However, cooperative evaluations are inevitably influenced by other poverty alleviation measures and rarely consider the characteristics of specific ethnic groups. Using cross-sectional surveys in Southwest China and employing propensity score matching (PSM) and endogenous switching regression (ESR) models, this paper analyzed the participation of poor households in New-type Agricultural Cooperatives (NACs) in ethnic areas and assessed the income impacts of NAC membership by eliminating unobserved biases and group heterogeneity. This study detected heterogeneous policy perceptions and behavioral differences between the member and nonmember groups, and the PSM and ESR model results indicated that, overall, participation in the NACs had a positive effect on household income. The ESR model was found to be more plausible as it was able to reveal the significant income gaps under a counterfactual inference framework. Local policymakers need to focus on the policy perception and behavioral and earning capability differences between groups and increase the balanced policy implementation.

TI  - The interaction between pests, mixed-maize crop production and food security: a case study of smallholder farmers in Mwea West, Kenya
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - Crop pests (weeds, insect pests and pathogens) are recognised worldwide as a serious challenge to agricultural production and threat to food security. Potential losses due to weeds, animal pests and pathogens have been reported at 34%, 18% and 16%, respectively. In monetary terms losses can be high, for example, annual smallholder losses due to just five invasive species in six African countries have been estimated at US$0.9-1.1 billion. Here, smallholder mixed maize farmers' perceptions of the key constraints to their farming practices are considered. Semi-structured interviews with smallholder households, in addition to key informant interviews, reveal that farmers report insect pests, pathogens and weeds (collectively "pests") as the main constraints to farm production. Farmers report yield losses experienced due to pests, together with control expenditure significantly affect net income whilst undermining other livelihood assets. Farmers in Mwea West are highly vulnerable to a range of pests including a number of invasive alien species. Importantly, the farmer perceptions in this study agree with major research studies and confirm the serious impacts of pests on smallholder livelihoods. In order to achieve positive livelihood outcomes there is an urgent need for support to improve smallholder food security; this is especially important for countries with low gross domestic product.

Design/methodology/approach The authors use primary data from a survey on rural households living in three different districts in rural Africa. The authors design a social complexity index giving evidence on the poverty alleviation effect of complex patterns of civic participation at district level. Findings Results support the view that social capital may mitigate poverty only if a rural household simultaneously participates in a plurality of social communities. Such mitigation is reinforced if she also lives in a socially complex district, whereas on the contrary the social complexity of a district, per se, is not enough to alleviate poverty. Originality/value This paper contributes to advance the knowledge of African rural areas and to identify potential developments of poverty policies in Africa based on diversified social capital as a valuable ingredient for poverty alleviation policies. This paper also contributes to the debate on social capital by showing that diversified social capital has a prevailing individual nature rather than a collective one.

TI  - A double hurdle estimation of crop diversification decisions by smallholder wheat farmers in Sinana District, Bale Zone, Ethiopia
T2  - CABI AGRICULTURE & BIOSCIENCE
AB  - BackgroundEthiopia is heterogeneous in agro-ecological, social, and economic conditions. In such heterogeneous environment, crop production needs to be diversified to meet household consumption and market needs. This study analyzed determinants of crop diversification in wheat dominant producer rural households in Ethiopia's Sinana District of the Oromia Regional State. The study utilized a structured survey of 384 households, and both inferential and descriptive statistics were employed to analyze the data. A Cragg's double hurdle model was applied to identify factors influencing decision and the extent of crop diversification.ResultsWe found that decision to crop diversification was positively associated with household size, access to fertile farm plots, and access to extension services and negatively associated with age of household head, and participation in off/non-farm activities. The extent of crop diversification is positively associated with access to extension services, labor availability, membership to farmers cooperatives, and distance to market.ConclusionsThese findings support the need for resources to strengthen available extension packages, support existing farmers' cooperatives, and develop rural infrastructures in order to improve the smallholder farmers' extent of crop diversifications.

TI  - Microfinance illusion, poverty and welfare in Cambodia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMY
AB  - Recent studies at national level have emphasized the failure of microfinance services as a means for development in Cambodia due to high interest rates, non-productive use of loans, over-indebtedness, often landless customers and intergenerational migration. This paper examines the effect of access to microfinance on household poverty and welfare using cross-sectional data from a 2015 survey of 411 households in 48 districts located in nine of Cambodia's provinces. These households were beneficiaries of the Agriculture Cooperative (AC) community development project supported by World Vision and the Australian Government. Applying the Wald test of exogeneity and Newey's minimum chi-squared estimators with the two-step option, probit models of household poverty status were estimated, as well as tobit models of household welfare level with endogenous treatment effects. The findings suggest that access to microfinance is associated with poverty reduction and increased per capita income of the household, but access to microfinance services has an insignificant impact on household welfare proxied by per capita economic assets and expenditure on child well-being. However, the results must be interpreted with caution due to sample selection effects.

TI  - A Game-Based Approach to Exploring Gender Differences in Smallholder Decisions to Change Farming Practices: White Rice Production in Laos
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - What influences farmers' decisions to adopt agricultural technologies is an important question for international agricultural research projects. There are often interpersonal differences between women and men that influence the adoption of decisions and behaviours, but few studies in the literature focus on these factors. We describe a game-based approach to explore decision-making processes underpinning the adoption of new farming technologies and practices in Lao People's Democratic Republic. Sowing a different rice variety is the tailored technology. The game explored adoption behaviours influencing decisions on transitioning from growing glutinous rice, a traditional variety preferred for consumption, to "white" rice for commercial export to international markets. We conducted separate game-workshops with 36 women and 36 men in 4 villages of southern Laos that were transitioning from subsistence to commercial smallholder production. The gaming exposed various possible behaviours and decisions that women and men considered. Access to resources, both assets and information, was equal for all players, yet women were found to adopt new rice varieties more readily than men and to engage in cooperative behaviours in the game situation. The study highlighted the need for further gender-sensitive research into cooperation among women in the agricultural context-an understanding beneficial for countries and regions undergoing agricultural transition.

TI  - Rural Business Hub: Framework for a New Rural Development Approach in Rain-Fed Areas of Pakistan-A Case of Punjab Province
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - The purpose of this article is to present a framework that could be used to achieve the objective of sustainable rural development in a community which is characterized by high numbers of smallholders, landless peasants, and unskilled or semi-skilled labor ultimately leading to low productivity and high rates of poverty. The study presents a design inspired by "Saemaul Undong" (New Village Movement) of South Korea. The proposed model is based on proposing a four-tier approach for the working of the village-level cooperatives which will be self-reliant through a network connection to the national and international markets. Existing studies and surveys in Punjab province of Pakistan have established that rural areas are often lacking essential facilities that affect the abilities of these areas to retain skilled manpower thus leading to resource drain and negatively impacting the agricultural productivity. The proposed Village-City Model, "VCM," was designed to strengthen the local infrastructure and built interest-based cooperatives to develop an environment which can sustain the benefits of higher productivity and translate these into better livelihoods. It is proposed that farmer-centered cooperatives with appropriate institutional arrangements could result in developing village-based cities where skilled manpower can exert to in better resource use efficiency, access to market coupled with rural finance schemes to enhance resource base and access to technology. The cooperatives experience is considered as a bitter experience in Pakistan. However, the analysis of failures of cooperatives in Pakistan revealed many bottlenecks which have been addressed through indigenization of Saemaul Undong.

TI  - Impacts of land tenure security on yield and technical efficiency of maize farmers in Rwanda
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Land is a valuable resource that determines to a substantial level the social status and economic well-being of households in Rwanda. This study assesses the impact of land tenure security on the improvement of maize yield and technical efficiency of farmers in Rwanda. Using survey data collected in the Eastern Province of Rwanda in 2019, we adopt an approach that combines the sample selection-corrected stochastic production frontier model and propensity score matching model to control for possible selection biases that might arise from unobserved and observed variables. The results reveal that average technical efficiency is consistently higher for landowners than for non-landowners in all models. In addition, landowners appear to have a higher significant yield than non-landowners do. We also find that land input has the highest production elasticity for landowners and nonlandowners, implying its considerable influence on maize yield compared with that of other inputs. The fertilizer, labor, and access to irrigation variables also have a significantly positive effect on maize yield for landowners and non-landowners. Our results also show that variables such as education, cooperative membership, credit access, off-farm income, and livestock ownership have a positive and significant effect on the likelihood of owning full property rights to the land.

TI  - Smallholder Forestry in the Western Amazon: Outcomes from Forest Reforms and Emerging Policy Perspectives
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - The forest reforms unfolding during the last two decades in the western Amazon have embraced policy regimes founded on the principles of sustainable forest management. The policy frameworks adopted for smallholder forestry aimed to clarify forest rights including those of the indigenous people and smallholders, support the adoption of sustainable forest management and put a system in place to assure a legal timber supply. The emerging forest policy regimes have significantly shaped who has access to the forest, how the forest resources are used and the benefits that are utilized. We argue that forest reforms have not addressed some critical constraints facing smallholders in managing their forests either individually or collectively. Informal timber extraction persists with contradictory effects on smallholders and forests. Local participants continue to make a significant contribution in meeting a growing demand for timber through vigorous market networks that combine legal and illegal sources of timber supply. Some recent changes to forest policy frameworks emphasize approaches towards additional integrated forest management, simplification of regulations and incentives for improved forest management. We critically reflect on the scope, implementation and expected outcomes of these policy frameworks.

TI  - Uniform-Price Reverse Auction for Estimating the Costs of Reducing Open-Field Burning of Rice Residue in Nepal
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper describes the design, implementation and results of a uniform-price reverse auction and real payment system to incentivize the avoidance of open-field burning of rice straw by smallholder farmers in Nepal. The main objective of the study was to reveal the private costs to farmers of avoiding rice straw burning. The study used survey and auction data from a sample of 317 farmers from 18 villages in Southern Nepal. Using a sealed bid one-shot reverse auction a level of payment was determined at which farmers would find acceptable to not engage in residue burning. Based on the bid amount, 167 winner farmers were enrolled in a real payment programme. The results revealed that 86 % of the farmers complied with the programme to refrain from burning rice straw with an average payment of US$ 78.76/ha of paddy farm, which represents US$ 13.17/ton of of emissions. To identify the policy variables, linear and log-linear regressions were fitted with the bid amount using socioeconomic variables. Land area, farmer education, practice of joint household decision making, wage rate for farm labour and straw yield increased the bid amount. The design and methods of field implementation of the reverse auction gave useful information for the advancement of conservation auctions and their replication in developing countries.

TI  - Showing our story our way: exploring the learning processes of gender awareness videos in Papua New Guinea
T2  - DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE
AB  - In Papua New Guinea (PNG), smallholder farmers, particularly women and girls, are the backbone of food production and food security; therefore, engaging these farmers in learning and development programs is key. We present and analyse a project that developed a story-telling digital video for farmers with low literacy as a learning tool in the sensitive area of gender equity. Although the video was a cross cultural collaboration between PNG and Australian team members, the PNG team took responsibility for the video's vision, content, and process to ensure that the video resonated with the farmers' local culture and context. As adult learners make meaning from their interactions in their own social world and that world is culturally, linguistically, and place-specific, we conclude that a locally created video drama featuring a PNG family can facilitate situated, affective, collective, and transformative learning.

TI  - Mangrove forests and aquaculture in the Mekong river delta
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The mangrove area in Viet Nam is dramatically decreasing in the last decades. Since 1995, mangrove forests in south Viet Nam are allotted and contracted to households for protection, management and logging. Under this policy, households are allowed to convert 20-40% of the allotted forests into other uses, mainly shrimp fanning. Most households develop mixed shrimp-mangrove farming systems, in which shrimp ponds are mixed with mangrove forest. With the poor enforcement of the forest assignment policy, however, the mangrove forest is over-extracted as farmers are converting more than the allowed level for larger water surface areas for shrimp farming and higher returns. In this study, we examine the impacts of mangrove coverage of mixed mangrove shrimp ponds using the production and profit functions. Our analyses show that mangrove density has no impacts on shrimp farming. However, mangrove coverage affects productivity and profit of shrimp farming. The optimal mangrove coverage for shrimp farming is found to be approximately 60%. This implies that maintaining the level of mangrove coverage of 60% does not only to comply with the policy, but also bring about the highest level of output and profit for shrimp farmers.

TI  - Non-Farm Employment Experience, Risk Preferences, and Low-Carbon Agricultural Technology Adoption: Evidence from 1843 Grain Farmers in 14 Provinces in China
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Guiding and encouraging farmers to adopt low-carbon agricultural technologies is highly significant for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, mitigating climate change, and achieving agricultural production development and food security. This study used survey data from 1843 grain farmers in 14 provinces of China to empirically analyze the impact of non-farm employment experience and risk preferences on grain farmers' low-carbon agricultural technology (LCAT) adoption. The results show that for grain farmers: (1) non-farm employment experience significantly promoted the adopting of LCAT. The probability of adopting LCAT by those with non-farm experience is 23.5% higher than those without. (2) Non-farm employment experience reinforced their risk preferences and promoted the adoption of LCAT. The adoption probability of LCAT of those with high-risk preferences was 6.1% higher than those with low-risk preferences. (3) The impact of non-farm employment experience on adopting LCAT was more significant for those with high education and training. Non-farm employment experience outside the province and employment experience in the tertiary sector while working outside significantly affect grain farmers' LCAT adoption.

TI  - Effect of Farmland Transfer on Poverty Reduction under Different Targeted Poverty Alleviation Patterns Based on PSM-DID Model in Karst Area of China
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB  - Rural farmland transfer is a key factor in the successful implementation of targeted poverty alleviation strategies in China. In this paper, a multidimensional index system with 15 indicators from five dimensions, namely, natural, human, physical, financial, and social capital was established. It analyzed the effect of farmland transfer on poverty alleviation under four typical poverty alleviation models implemented in a karst area in China by using Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and Difference-in-Difference (DID) to analyze 467 rural households questionnaire responses from five representative villages in Guizhou Province. The results show that different models had different effects on poverty reduction. In the model of "three changes" + relocation for poverty alleviation + rural tourism + poor households, farmland transfer was the most effective in poverty alleviation, as attested by its average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) value of 0.44. Rural households' nonfarm income increased significantly to develop rural tourism after relocation from inhospitable areas. In the model of "farmland lease/shareholding" +cooperative + enterprise + poor households, farmland transfer had a moderate effect on poverty alleviation, with an ATT value of 0.06. Its effect on the total income of rural households was the lowest among the four models. This study's results can provide a theoretical reference for solidifying the benefits of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization strategies in karst areas.

TI  - Ageing threatens sustainability of smallholder farming in China
T2  - NATURE
AB  - Rapid demographic ageing substantially affects socioeconomic development(1-4) and presents considerable challenges for food security and agricultural sustainability(5-8), which have so far not been well understood. Here, by using data from more than 15,000 rural households with crops but no livestock across China, we show that rural population ageing reduced farm size by 4% through transferring cropland ownership and land abandonment (approximately 4 million hectares) in 2019, taking the population age structure in 1990 as a benchmark. These changes led to a reduction of agricultural inputs, including chemical fertilizers, manure and machinery, which decreased agricultural output and labour productivity by 5% and 4%, respectively, further lowering farmers' income by 15%. Meanwhile, fertilizer loss increased by 3%, resulting in higher pollutant emissions to the environment. In new farming models, such as cooperative farming, farms tend to be larger and operated by younger farmers, who have a higher average education level, hence improving agricultural management. By encouraging the transition to new farming models, the negative consequences of ageing can be reversed. Agricultural input, farm size and farmer's income would grow by approximately 14%, 20% and 26%, respectively, and fertilizer loss would reduce by 4% in 2100 compared with that in 2020. This suggests that management of rural ageing will contribute to a comprehensive transformation of smallholder farming to sustainable agriculture in China.

TI  - Impacts of cooperative membership on banana yield and risk exposure: Insights from China
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - The yield-increasing effects of agricultural cooperative membership have been widely examined in the literature. However, so far, little is known about whether cooperative membership has the potential to reduce farmers' exposure to production risk. We address this gap by estimating the impacts of cooperative membership on expected yield, yield variance (variability), and yield skewness (exposure to downside risk), using data collected from a survey of 626 banana farmers in China. We employ an endogenous switching regression model to address the selectivity bias issue. The empirical results show that cooperative membership increases banana yield by 3% and reduces the variance and downside risk exposure by 60% and 114%, respectively. The results are supported by robustness check estimates, using propensity score matching and inverse probability weighted regression adjustment models. Additional analysis reveals that the treatment effects of cooperative membership vary among members with different household and farm characteristics. Our findings suggest that agricultural cooperatives can be an effective institutional arrangement for reducing production risk and crop failure and point to the need for policies and programmes in developing cooperatives and increasing membership involvements of smallholder farmers.

TI  - Labor Market Outcomes and Reforms in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Over the past few decades of economic reform, China's labor markets have been transformed to an increasingly market-driven system. China has two segregated economies: the rural and urban. Understanding the shifting nature of this divide is probably the key to understanding the most important labor market reform issues of the last decades and the decades ahead. From 1949, the Chinese economy allowed virtually no labor mobility between the rural and urban sectors. Rural-urban segregation was enforced by a household registration system called "hukou." Individuals born in rural areas receive "agriculture hukou" while those born in cities are designated as "nonagricultural hukou." In the countryside, employment and income were linked to the commune-based production system. Collectively owned communes provided very basic coverage for health, education, and pensions. In cities, state-assigned life-time employment, centrally determined wages, and a cradle-to-grave social welfare system were implemented. In the late 1970s, China's economic reforms began, but the timing and pattern of the changes were quite different across rural and urban labor markets. This paper focuses on employment and wages in the urban labor markets, the interaction between the urban and rural labor markets through migration, and future labor market challenges. Despite the remarkable changes that have occurred, inherited institutional impediments still play an important role in the allocation of labor; the hukou system remains in place, and 72 percent of China's population is still identified as rural hukou holders. China must continue to ease its restrictions on rurala is an element of urban migration, and must adopt policies to close the widening rural-urban gap in education, or it risks suffering both a shortage of workers in the growing urban areas and a deepening urban-rural economic divide.

TI  - Does agricultural cooperative membership impact technical efficiency of maize production in Nigeria: An analysis correcting for biases from observed and unobserved attributes
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The formation of agricultural cooperatives has been widely promoted as an agricultural development policy initiative to help smallholder farmers cope with multiple production and marketing challenges. Using a nationally representative survey dataset of smallholder maize producers from rural Nigeria, this study assesses the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on technical efficiency (TE). We based our estimation approach on the combination of a newly developed sample selection stochastic production frontier model with propensity score matching to control for possible selectivity biases from both observables and unobservables. We estimate stochastic meta-frontiers to examine TE differences between cooperative members and non-members. Our results reveal that TE levels of members are consistently higher than that of non-members. This calls for continued policy incentives targeted at encouraging farmers to form as well as participate in agricultural cooperatives.

TI  - Savannah gendered transition: how woodlands dynamics and changes in fuelwood delivery influence economic autonomy in Mali
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study examined the interactions between social and ecological dynamics in a savannah ecosystem in Mali. In a context of cotton crises and of forest reform with the creation of rural woodfuel markets managed by woodcutters' cooperatives, we assessed the impact of changes in savannah characteristics (biomass, biodiversity) on the delivery of fuelwood by comparing woodcutting practices in selected savannah sites and households from 2003 to 2010. Our findings show that changes in the delivery of fuelwood over the study period led to a shift in activities and roles and consequently affected the social status of different savannah users. Marginalized users (women and young men) benefited from the changes in savannah structure to secure independent livelihoods, and opportunities emerged for women and young men to increase their economic autonomy. Although the observed trends did not produce a radical transformation of existing (unbalanced) gender- and age-based power relations, this study demonstrates how changes in the savannah structure may offer vulnerable people an opportunity to change certain power imbalances and limitations.

TI  - Labor off-farm employment and household forest management investment in Jiangxi, China: A perspective from gender influence of rural labor
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING
AB  - That numerous rural laborers migrate to urban areas to find off-farm jobs has become an outstanding economic phenomenon in China. To examine the impact of rural labor off-farm employment on household forest management, we built binary logistic models and Tobit models by applying a sample survey data of 500 households in rural Jiangxi in 2018. Households' participation and investment in forest management were measured by their labor and cash input. The results indicated that more off-farm laborers in household would hold back their participation in cash input. In contrast, a higher rate of female off-farm employment encouraged household monetary input. And households with more female agricultural laborers were more likely to participate in labor input. Neither off-farm employment nor female off-farm employment significantly influences households' labor input. Off-farm employment of the householder negatively influenced labor and cash input. Policy factors, such as obtaining forestry subsidies and forestry loans, joining forestry co-operative organizations, and better attitude to the logging quota system, also promoted households' participation and investment in forest management. Household head's age and education, forestry land status also affected participation in forest management. Our analysis could provide basis for managers to formulate policies to support sustainable forest management. Recommendations for Resource Managers:
   The econometric models applied in this research could reflect the influence of rural labor off-farm employment on household forest management behavior and provide a quantitative basis for formulating forest management policies. There were great differences between rural households' forest management cash input behavior and labor input behavior and households were more active in labor input compared with cash input. The gender structure of rural labor off-farm employment could impact households' forest management participation and investment. To achieve sustainable forest management, managers should pay attention to enhancing female forestry technique training and encouraging forest land transfer and consolidation in the collective forest regions of China.

TI  - China's Grassland Contract Policy and its Impacts on Herder Ability to Benefit in Inner Mongolia: Tragic Feedbacks
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Northern China's grasslands have been losing productivity since the 1980s, when a policy known as the "grassland contracting policy" allocated commonly used grazing lands to individual herder households. Examined here is the connection between implementation of the grassland contracting policy and the loss of grassland production using the analytic concepts of ability to benefit and community failure. A gacha (village) of the Sunite Left Banner of the Xilingol League in Inner Mongolia is used as a case study to compare herder ability to benefit from rangeland resources during adverse climate events before and after policy implementation. Social-ecological resilience, access to social and ecological assets, and institutions supporting crisis relief have been affected. We find that the privatization of grassland use rights has weakened pastoralist ability to benefit from rangelands by weakening or dismantling what are identified as the rights-, structure-, and relations-based abilities that enabled pastoralists to cope with nonequilibrium conditions. This has led to a community failure that engenders feedbacks of increased impoverishment and environmental deterioration. The inflexible boundaries of quasi-private household property rights have caused the pastoral system to lose capacity to respond to drought and weather events through the flexibility of "otor" and other forms of herd movement, increasing vulnerability to environmental change.

TI  - Food Environments, Food Security, and Household Food Availability of Circular Migrant Families: A Mixed-Methods Study Among Brick Kiln Laborers in Bihar, India
T2  - FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN
AB  - Background: Circular migration is the dominant pattern of movement in India and is a livelihood strategy used by many food insecure rural households. Repeated shifts in food environments have important implications on household food security and dietary patterns but have not been studied. Objective: To explore differences in the food environment, food security, and food availability between home and destination spaces. Methods: Mixed-methods research was conducted among circular migrant families working and residing on brick kilns in the state of Bihar. Utilizing stratified cluster sampling, 2 rounds of cross-sectional data were collected from 2564 families. Additionally, 25 in-depth interviews were conducted with circular migrant parents, kiln owners, and labor contractors. The Food Insecurity Experience Scale was validated for use in our study population. Bivariate analyses were conducted to estimate the association of food insecurity with sociodemographic variables. Qualitative data were analyzed using descriptive thematic methods. Results: Seventy percent of respondents utilized at least one nonmarket source of food at the origin; at the destination, sources of food were limited to the private market. Despite higher food prices at the destination, perceived food affordability was higher during periods of migration, resulting in improved food security. Tubers, rice, and wheat were typically available in the household daily, whereas fruits, eggs, and dairy were typically unavailable during the week. Conclusions: Circular migration can enable short-term food security by improving food affordability. Policy frameworks must address the root causes of chronic food insecurity, especially among rural-to-rural circular migrant families.

TI  - Gendered constraints for adopting climate-smart agriculture amongst smallholder Ethiopian women farmers
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB  - Although Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) can offer economic and food security opportunities for women farmers, success in the uptake of these technologies is contested by gendered constraints. Previous studies that use the household head as a unit of analysis to explain adoption patterns do not adequately demonstrate the extent to which women smallholders are restricted by gendered constraints. This study uses 344 women and men survey respondents involved in conservation agriculture (CA) and small-scale irrigation schemes (SSIS) as data sources for examining the effect of gendered constraints for adopting climate-smart agriculture amongst women in three areas in Ethiopia. Qualitative and quantitative data collections were applied using survey, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's chi-square test and binary logistic regression using statistical software for the social sciences (SPSS) version 24. Thematic and narrative analysis methods were used to analyze qualitative data. The findings show that women smallholders uptake is affected by limited access to credit, extension, restricted membership in cooperatives and water user associations, lack of access or user rights to land, skill training, information, and restricted mobility. Agricultural development interventions should be implemented by accepting and considering individual farmer's entitlement to development. Expanding off-farm diversification and rural employment opportunities through changing the land tenure system, which is currently state-owned, are essential to enhance women smallholders' access to land and other agricultural inputs.

TI  - Vulnerability of South African women workers in the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - On March 5th, 2020, the first SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) case was diagnosed in South Africa. Shortly after, President Cyril Ramaphosa, declared a National State of Disaster placing the country under "lockdown". Two years later the National State of Disaster was terminated on 15 March 2022 with more than 3.9 million cases of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 fatalities recorded. In the context of this pandemic the vulnerability of working women in South Africa increased considerably. In South Africa most women workers find themselves in vulnerable employment as domestic help in private households, traders in the informal economy, and small-scale agriculture with no employment contracts or health insurance cover. During the pandemic, women workers had to further deal with the socioeconomic vulnerability of their employment, dual domestic and working responsibilities and those infected with COVID-19, with the clinical sequelae of the disease. The government implemented several policies to assist workers and reduce the risk faced by vulnerable workers, including women. Despite these initiatives, long-term policies aimed at socioeconomic protection and employment creation that focus on women workers are required to address the negative impact of the COVD-19 pandemic as experienced by women workers in South Africa.

TI  - The Effect of Land Scarcity on Farm Structure: Empirical Evidence from Mali
T2  - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE
AB  - We analyze the individualization of farm units in Mali in the sense of a transformation of purely collective farms into mixed units in which private plots coexist with collective fields. Since a moral-hazard-in-team problem plagues production on the latter and the household head extracts his income from it, he faces a trade-off between efficiency and capture. We show, within the framework of a patriarchal farm household model, that private plots become profitable for the head once land becomes sufficiently scarce. Specifically, greater land scarcity raises both the probability to find private plots in afarm and the share of farmland allocated to these plots. On the basis of firsthand data collected in southern Mali, we test and confirm the two predictions yielded by the above theory. Moreover, we show that a higher number of married men within the household has the same effect as land scarcity, thus suggesting an interesting refinement of the moral-hazard-in-team argument.

TI  - Can land transfer through land cooperatives foster off-farm employment in China?
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Functioning land markets are necessary for an increase in off-farm employment. However, there is limited empirical evidence on the impact of land transfer on off-farm employment in rural China. This paper investigates the drivers of households' cooperative membership, which is equivalent to transferring land through land cooperatives, and its impact on off-farm employment. Using a two-step control function approach and data from Suzhou and Yangzhou (Jiangsu province), we do not find a general effect of cooperative membership on household heads' current off-farm employment, though the effect is large for households which had surplus agricultural labor before cooperative initiation. The effect is also positive and large for household heads without off-farm experience and households located in Yangzhou. Policy-makers should be aware of the distributional consequences of these heterogeneous effects.

TI  - Pesticide practices and suicide among farmers of the Sundarban region in India
T2  - FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN
AB  - Background. Deliberate self-poisoning by ingesting pesticides is a serious health problem among farmers, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Preventing these suicides is a priority for a public mental health agenda.
   Objective. To examine the role of pesticide poisoning in suicide and nonfatal deliberate self-harm, and clarify awareness of risks, safe practices concerning storage and use of pesticides, and associated self-injury, both unintentional and intentional, within farmer households of the Sundarban region, India.
   Methods. Retrospective record review of adult cases of deliberate self-poisoning at the Block Primary Health Centres of 13 Sundarban Blocks was performed to analyze the relative roles of various methods of self-harm and their lethality. Focus group discussions, questionnaires, and in-depth interviews were undertaken in a community study of farmer households to examine pesticide-related views and practices, with particular attention to storage, use, and health impact.
   Results. Pesticide poisoning was the most common method of deliberate self-harm in both men and women. Pesticide storage in most households was unsafe and knowledge was inadequate concerning adverse effects of pesticides on health, crops, and the environment.
   Conclusions. An intersectoral approach linking the interests of public health, mental health, and agriculture is well suited to serve the collective interests of all three agendas better than each in isolation. Such an approach is needed to reduce morbidity and mortality from unintentional and intentional self-injury in low-income agricultural communities like those of the Sundarban region.

TI  - Reforming capital subsidy scheme to finance energy transition for the below poverty line communities in rural India
T2  - ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - India's rural poor are caught in a downward energy poverty cycle with either a lack of access to modem energy sources or reliable grid electricity supply. Overcoming these barriers will require strategies that account for extremely low levels of income, lack of access to finance, poor awareness of alternative energy technologies and deficient post-installation service on solar home systems (SHSs). Our study is novel in examining reasons accounting for the slow adoption of SHSs in rural areas from the perspective of a rural (Grameen) bank. We reveal current government energy policies especially SHS subsidy scheme, largely exclude those below the poverty line. This self-induced socioeconomic barrier, in turn, limits the involvement of the banking sector who report additional barriers including higher lending costs and financial risks coupled with internally restrictive lending practices. We propose a revised framework the Rural Energy Transformation through Pro-Poor Subsidy to support an SHS capital subsidy scheme which specifically includes below poverty line households, and incorporates an electronic subsidy disbursement mechanism designed to improve efficiency and effective delivery between five key actors. These include the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, the Regional Rural Banks and suppliers deploying and maintaining subsidised SHS and the rural households. The framework would establish a contractual partnership between banks and suppliers, and at a policy level would require the government to mandate banks to lend at low margins and offer dedicated subsidy benefits to low-income populations to enable a rural energy transformation.

TI  - Crop appropriation, labour supply, and demand for farm inputs: Evidence from Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Crop appropriation occurs when portions of a farmer's crops are taken by individuals to whom she has no contractual obligation. While it is a reality in rural areas across developing countries, its economics has barely received attention. This paper uses data from Nigerian women farmers whom local patriarchal norms have typically had as crop owners rather than landowners to explore the question of how crop appropriation might affect levels of engagement in agriculture. I find the phenomenon to induce less time farming, greater participation in off-farm employment, and lower demand for farm inputs.

TI  - Factors affecting market outlet choices of pepper producers in Wonberma district, Northwest Ethiopia: multivariate probit approach
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - Pepper is an important cash crop for its contribution to income-generating, employment opportunity and improvement of food security to the majority of the rural households. However, enhancing pepper producers to reach the market is a key issue needed in Wonberma district. This study sought to analyze determinants of market outlet choices among smallholder pepper producers in Wonberma district of West Gojjam Zone of Amhara Region, Ethiopia. Both primary and secondary source of data were used to collect qualitative and quantitative data. Two-stage sampling method was used and data were collected from 130 pepper producers. Multivariate probit (MVP) model was used to analyze factors affecting market outlet choices of smallholder pepper producers. The MVP model results indicated that quantity of pepper produced, pepper farming experience, extension contact, year of schooling, bargaining power of the producer; post-harvest value addition, market distance, and livestock ownership had a statistically significant influence on choices of the market outlet. Therefore, this study underscores increasing productivity of pepper; enhancing post harvest value addition practices, improve farmers bargaining power through cooperative; strengthen institutional services and infrastructure development like road and transportation facility for policy implication.

TI  - Consumer cooperatives, food security and the sustainability of civil servants in urban cities of Ondo State, Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The issues of food security and family sustenance have been a major problem in recent times. A large number of the urban populace has not been able to provide the food need of their family. Due to urban expansion, there is limited or no land for subsistence farming. The few that have the opportunity withdrew due to pilfering and competing time for office work, home and the farm. In order to deal with the crisis, civil servants formed cooperative societies which engaged in the bulk purchase of food items for the co-operators. The bill of food items purchased serves as loans which were deducted from their salaries. The study examines the effectiveness of cooperative societies in ensuring household food security and sustainability of civil servants in urban cities of Ondo state. A total of 180 civil servants were randomly selected and interviewed for the study. Findings show that majority 48.33% of the respondents patronize the consumer cooperative societies monthly to purchase the food need of the family, while 32.78% patronize the societies quarterly. The most important reason for patronizing being getting cheaper food prices than the market price and the ease of payment. Some at the end of the month, after all deductions made from their salaries, rarely have something to take home but believe in a Yoruba adage which says Tebi bati kuro ninu ise, ise buse' literarily meaning that when hunger is out of poverty, then poverty is drastically reduced. Result of the probit model reveals a significant relationship between consumers' cooperatives and household food security, a positive significant relationship between educational status, income and food security. However, there is a negative relationship between family size and food security, indicating that the higher the family size, the greater the level of food insecurity.

TI  - Health, income and poverty: evidence from China's rural household survey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB  - Background Understanding the health status of the poor households and the influence of unhealthy on their income can provide some vital insights into the effectiveness and appropriateness of poverty reduction solutions. Methods Based on a nationwide cross-sectional survey of 29,712 rural poor households, this study systematically investigated the causes of poverty and health status of Chinese rural poor households, and revealed the relationship between health, income and poverty. Results The health status of the rural poor in China is not optimistic, with 51.63% attributing their poverty to the illness of household members. NCDs are the biggest health threat to the rural poor in China. Over 60% of all the households have at least one patient and more than a quarter of the households with patients cannot afford expensive medical expenses. Although 98% of all the households participate in China's a rural health insurance system - the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme - 16% are still unable to bear their medical expenses after reimbursement from the scheme. Further, high altitude, ill-health and low-income are interlinked and mutually reinforcing. The per capita net income of poor households was inversely proportional to the altitude of their places of residence, family aging and unhealthy status, but was positively correlated with the number of workforces in their families. Conclusions Poverty due to illness is one of the root causes of rural poverty in China. With the backward medical infrastructure in high altitude areas, people are more prone to fall into the vicious circle of poverty-unhealthy-low income-poverty. The establishment of effective long-term mechanism of disease prevention and intervention is an important prerequisite to enhance the endogenous development power of the poor and reduce poverty.

TI  - Do rice varieties matter? Climate change adaptation and livelihood diversification among rural smallholder households in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - While it is known that the threat of climatic stresses induces rural smallholders to diversify their livelihood strategies, a consensus has not been reached as to what type of stress induces which strategy, especially in the Mekong Delta Region (MDR) of Vietnam. Primary data were obtained from randomly selected 405 households producing rice (Oryza sativa L.) in three provinces in the MDR. Simpson's diversity index was used to assess the level of diversification, multivariate probit regression was utilized to examine the factors affecting farmers' adoption of livelihood strategies, and tobit regression was employed to examine the factors influencing the extent of farmers' diversification. The index showed relatively low levels of livelihood diversification in the study area. The results of the multivariate probit regression analysis of four livelihood strategies indicated that farmers who were exposed to drought or flood were more likely to cultivate conventional rice varieties than newer cultivars, likely because the newer varieties accessible in the study areas were of the resource-using type that were high-yielding under favorable conditions but susceptible to environmental stresses. Furthermore, those prone to salinity intrusion tended to engage in off-farm income opportunities. In addition, the results of the tobit regression analysis exhibited significant effects of asset endowment, extension services, public transport availability, agricultural inputs, and cooperative membership on the extent of livelihood diversification. To enhance rural livelihoods in the MDR, intervention programs should ensure to provide the resource-saving type of improved varieties as well as promote off-farm employment in salt-affected areas.

TI  - Econometric analysis of income, productivity and diversification among smallholders in Brazil
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Family farming plays important roles in agricultural production and the world's food security. This paper provides an econometric analysis of income, productivity and diversification of Brazilian smallholders. Using the most updated data from the Ministry of Agrarian Development (MDA) enables a more precise analysis than traditional agri-census data. The database contains approximately 4.7 million family farmers from all regions of the country. We used linear and tobit regression to untangle useful information behind these large datasets. The results demonstrated that the smallholders that are part of an agricultural cooperative or a member of a farmer's association positively affect income, productivity and diversification. The age of household heads is shown to have a non-linear relationship in the three cases, while the household head being female presented a negative effect in all regressions. Although recent technical assistance showed negative impacts on income and productivity, farmer's assistance positively affected the likelihood of a smallholder diversifying their production and, therefore, becoming less subject to price imbalances. The results support current views in the field of smallholder farming while presenting marked regional differences of a continental country, enabling policy makers to make better, more informed decisions.

TI  - Dataset on Women's empowerment, land and donor-driven agricultural interventions in Eastern Zambia
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
AB  - A survey was conducted with 235 randomly selected households to investigate women's empowerment, land and donor-driven agricultural interventions in Eastern Zambia [1] for aid programmes with (Norwegian) and without (Chinese) women empowerment goals. The survey was complemented by six focus group discussions (FGDs) and 12 key informant interviews. A triple-stream approach for focus discussions was used (i.e. women-only, men-only, and mixed gender). The results suggest that despite differing aid programme modalities, there was increased access to, and control over, productive resources by women farmers. At least 60% of the respondents reported joint ownership of all types of livestock and poultry, including large livestock such as cattle. Within households, decisions on cotton, groundnuts, and maize were made jointly by the husband and wife. Greater than 70% of the respondents in both Norwegian and Chinese aided households reported joint decision making by the husband and wife. Although both men and women farmers attended training sessions, the percentage of attending respondents was lower for Chinese-aid affiliated farmers. The majority (81% - Norwegian aid; 89% - Chinese aid) jointly earned and owned the income from cotton. When women entered into contract farming with the cotton company, operations management was performed by the entire household, and the applicable income was considered jointly earned.

TI  - Land rental market, off-farm employment and agricultural production in Southeast China: A plot-level case study
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - This paper performs a plot-level analysis of the impact of land rental market participation and off-farm employment on land investment, input use, and rice yields for 215 plots cultivated by 52 households in three villages in Northeast Jiangxi Province. Our findings show that households that rent extra land are relatively more productive, but contradict results of earlier studies which found that tenure status of plots affects the level of land investments. We further find that off-farm employment does not significantly affect rice yields. This result contradicts those of earlier studies which found that the negative lost-labor effect of off-farm employment dominates the positive income effect. Another novel finding is that people working locally off-farm tend to switch from green manure planting towards the use of organic manure on their rice plots. We conclude that policies that will further stimulate the development of land rental markets, which is still in its infancy, can contribute significantly to higher rice production in Southeast China. Another implication of our results is that worries about the negative impact that the continuously growing off-farm employment may have on China's goal to remain self-sufficient in grain production are less relevant at the moment for the region examined in our study.

TI  - Understanding herdsmen's rangeland rent-in behaviour under current rural land tenure system of China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Current rural land tenure system in China, characterized by the so-called "separation of three rights", i.e., the division and parallel of collective ownership, household contract right and transferable management right, provides a solid legal basis for rangeland transfer, which is deemed crucial for addressing a range of sustain-ability challenges. Drawn on the theory of planned behaviour and applying structural equation modelling to analyse a survey dataset, we investigate the effects of cognitive antecedents, and their possible interactions, on herdsmen's intention and behaviour in regards to rangeland rent-in. Our results show that the most important antecedent is subjective attitude, mainly influenced by herders' economic rationality regarding scale operation and expected benefit. This is followed by perceived behavioural control, in turn largely affected by herders' familiarity with policies and access to transaction information. Finally, subjective norms influenced by the opinions of relatives and friends are weighted stronger than those of authorities. Positive correlations are also found between the three antecedents. The findings are improving our understanding of factors influencing herders' heterogeneous responses in regards to rangeland rental, and can help inform policy interventions to harness individuals' psychology in the development of more prosperous rangeland transfer systems in pastoral regions of China.

TI  - Let the farmer decide: examining smallholder autonomy in large-scale land acquisitions with an agent-based model

AB  - Large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) can facilitate agricultural intensification in low- and middle-income countries, but they frequently dispossess smallholders of their land and thereby generate tradeoffs between market-oriented production and smallholder livelihoods. Given the global prevalence of LSLAs, it is important to understand how they can be structured to reconcile these goals. This paper focuses on contract farming (CF) as a means to reorient LSLAs to more effectively support smallholder land rights and food security. We develop an agent-based model of mixed crop-livestock smallholder livelihoods and calibrate it using household survey data from four LSLAs in Ethiopia. We apply the model to examine smallholder food security and regional productivity under three conditions representing increasing smallholder autonomy over land management: LSLA with smallholder displacement, LSLA with forced CF, and opt-in CF. Our modeling results indicate that supporting smallholder land rights through CF can mitigate the tradeoffs generated by LSLA-induced displacement. LSLAs that implemented a CF scheme improved food security and generated comparable productivity increases to LSLAs with displacement. Further, allowing smallholders to decide whether to participate in a CF scheme (i.e. avoiding land acquisition) resulted in greater alignment between the two outcomes, particularly due to improved food security for poorer households. Our results suggest that to realize these benefits it is important to ensure contract compliance and thereby maintain smallholder trust in the contracting firm. Thus, LSLA governance that fosters smallholder agency, empowerment, and security of land rights could contribute to sustainable development.

TI  - Enhancing adaptation to climate variability in the East African highlands: a case for fostering collective action among smallholder farmers in Kenya and Uganda
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - There is an increasing recognition of the role of climate change adaptation among smallholder farmers in rain-fed agriculture in Africa. Collective action among smallholder farmers has been suggested as influencing local adaptation processes hence the need to evaluate its impact in different contexts. This paper provides evidence of collective action in enhancing local adaptation to climate variability. It determines the importance of different forms of collective action for enhancing adaptation. Through simple random sampling, a survey of 240 households in Embu County in Kenya and 200 households from Kapchorwa district of Uganda was undertaken. Focus-group discussions involving farmer groups and local government representatives were performed to triangulate information collected through the surveys. The results show a positive relationship between membership in farmer groups and adaptation to climate variability in both sites. Four main components of collective action were identified in Embu and these included the development of internal group capacities, assets mobilization and management, collective marketing, and management of human and natural capital. In Kapchorwa, the development of internal group capacities, risk spreading, and financial resources were significant. We argue that local-level governance and institutional arrangements for collective action are critical for successful adaptation to climate variability.

TI  - Trends and socio-economic disparities in catastrophic health expenditure and health impoverishment in China: 2010 to 2016
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - Objectives To investigate trends and socio-economic disparities in the catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and health impoverishment in China after major reform of the health system and to examine the impacts of the chronic disease on CHE and impoverishment. Methods We obtained data from four rounds of the China Family Panel Studies 2010-2016, with a sample size of 14 960 households. We defined CHE as the point at which annual household health payments exceeded 40% of annual capacity to pay. Impoverishment is measured by the $1.90 per day poverty line. Multivariate logistic regression models were performed to identify impacts of the family member with chronic disease on CHE and impoverishment. Results Between 2010 and 2016, the incidence of CHE in China decreased from 19.37% to 15.11% and from 7.39% to 5.14% for health impoverishment; however, the decrease in level of impoverishment was less in rural areas (from 6.16% down to 3.03%) than in urban areas (from 8.46% down to 7.81%). The gap between impoverishment rates across the income quartiles is growing. Multivariable analysis showed that households with two or more members suffering chronic diseases were significantly more likely to incur CHE (aOR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.93-3.13) and impoverishment (aOR: 2.66, 95% CI: 1.87-3.78) than households with no members suffering chronic diseases, after adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Conclusions Important advances have been made in achieving greater financial protection for Chinese citizens. Nevertheless, greater attention to the poor households with chronic disease members is needed. Policymakers in China should focus on optimising integrated rural-urban health insurance by expanding the current benefit packages and strengthening poverty alleviation efforts.

TI  - Multinational oil companies in Nigeria and corporate social responsibility in the HIV/AIDS response in host communities
T2  - LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - We assess the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) of multinational oil companies (MOCs) on HIV/AIDS prevalence in Nigeria's oil-producing communities. One thousand, two hundred households were sampled across the rural communities of Niger Delta. Using logit model, the main result indicates that General Memorandum of Understandings (GMoUs) have not significantly impacted on factors behind the spread of HIV/AIDs in rural communities. This implies that the impact of the disease on MOCs business, employees and their families, contractors, business partners and the oil communities have not inclined downward. The findings suggest that CSR offers an opportunity for MOCs to help address HIV/AID prevalence through a business case for stakeholders' health in the region. It calls for MOCs to improve GMoUs health intervention on sensitisation campaigns, funding testing and counselling centres, subsidising anti-retroviral drugs, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, rehabilitation of orphaned and vulnerable children and other cares for people living with AIDS.

TI  - Beyond ecological synergies: examining the impact of participatory agroecology on social capital in smallholder farming communities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB  - The pivotal role of social capital in smallholder agriculture is widely acknowledged. The growth effect of social capital manifests in how networks and trust facilitate access to productive resources and knowledge sharing among farmers. While sub-Saharan Africa is considered a storehouse of rich social capital, recent literature indicates its rapid depletion due mainly to the rise of capitalist agriculture and concomitant reorganization of the relations of production that characterize smallholder agriculture. Agroecology is an alternative approach to agriculture aimed at addressing the adverse impacts of capitalist agriculture, including improving farmer-to-farmer networks. In this paper, we draw on longitudinal data from a five-year participatory agroecology intervention in Malawi using Difference-in-Difference (DID) to compare the social capital endowment of agroecology-practicing households (n = 514) and a control group of non-agroecology households (n = 400). We further employed linear regression to examine the relationship between social capital and agroecology adoption. Results from the DID analysis show a positive and statistically significant change in mean social capital for participatory agroecology households (beta = 0.325, p< 0.001) compared to non-agroecology households (beta = 0.108) after accounting for theoretically relevant factors. Overall, the average treatment effect of the intervention on social capital was positive (beta = 0.217, p< 0.01). We also found a bidirectional relationship between social capital and adoption of agroecology practices (beta = 0.12, p< 0.001). These findings reveal the positive inroads of agroecology beyond the farm-level and demonstrate the potential for policymakers to leverage these benefits to promote sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Technology adoption among cocoa farmers in Nigeria: what drives farmers' decisions?
T2  - FORESTS TREES AND LIVELIHOODS
AB  - Adoption of improved agricultural technologies is an important component for improvement in agricultural productivity especially in developing countries. This study assessed the adoption level and factors influencing farmers' decisions to adopt five improved agricultural technologies in Ondo State, Nigeria using cross-sectional data on 149 cocoa farmers. A Multivariate Probit model was specified to account for the simultaneous decision-making process farmers undergo to maximize utility given their budget constraint. Most of the farmers were male, old and cultivated an average of 7 hectares of cocoa. Most of them had adopted improved cocoa varieties (84.6%) and capsid control was the least adopted (53.0%) among the respondents. The MVP model results show that cocoa farmers that belong to cooperative groups have a greater likelihood of adopting all five technologies. Older farmers are more likely to adopt improved cocoa varieties, and those with large farms have a greater likelihood of adopting recommended spacing. Credit access, education and extension contact positively influence improved cocoa varieties' adoption, while household size negatively influences it. The study recommends the improvement of institutional capacities especially in the areas of credit provision and extension service delivery in order to promote technology adoption for increased agricultural productivity in Nigeria.

TI  - The effect of the health poverty alleviation project on financial risk protection for rural residents: evidence from Chishui City, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundIllness is the leading cause (44%) of poverty in China. Since 2016, The health poverty alleviation project, an integral component of the Targeted Poverty Alleviation in China, was implemented in 2016 to strengthen financial risk protection against illness for financially backward segments of the population. However, the effects of the health poverty alleviation project on financial risk protection have not been explored in the literature, this paper aims to bridge the gap.MethodsUsing panel data on 63,426 rural households in Chishui City, China, from 2014 to 2017, the difference-in-differences with propensity score matching method was employed.ResultsThe health poverty alleviation project reduces out-of-pocket payments by 15% on average and decreases the probability of catastrophic health expenditure (annual out-of-pocket payments exceeding 10% of annual household income) and impoverishing health spending occurrence (out-of-pocket payments are forcing a household into poverty or into deeper poverty) by 7.7 and 11.7%, respectively. Additionally, the project increases the number of annual hospitalizations per household by 0.035.ConclusionOur study demonstrates that the health poverty alleviation project significantly improves financial risk protection by reducing out-of-pocket payments and decreasing the probability of incurring catastrophic or impoverishing levels of health expenditure. Our study has implications for the poverty reduction policies and reform of the Chinese health financing system.

TI  - HEALTH INSURANCE AND MEDICAL IMPOVERISHMENT IN RURAL CHINA: EVIDENCE FROM GUIZHOU PROVINCE
T2  - SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - We analyze the effects of the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) on poverty, using micro-level household data from 17 villages in a poor area of China's Guizhou province. A four-wave panel dataset allows us to follow NCMS through its reforms. First-order impact assessments suggest NCMS helps reduce the poverty rate by up to 3 percentage points, and the poverty gap by up to 15 percentage points. It also reduces the contribution of health expenditures to inequality as measured by Gini coefficient. The benefits of NCMS in terms of poverty and inequality appear considerably larger after major reforms in 2009, which expanded benefits and coverage.

TI  - On Childhood and Risk: An Exploration of Children's Everyday Experiences in Rural Peru
T2  - CHILDREN & SOCIETY
AB  - Drawing on data from Peru, this article explores how poverty mediates diverse risks in rural children's lives. It offers four main arguments. First, risk is not simply a feature of 'extraordinary' childhoods, but integral to everyday, 'ordinary' lives. Second, children's responses to adversity are crucially shaped by sociomoral considerations. Third, children participate actively in household risk mitigation, their engagement structured by individual (biographical) and collective factors. Fourth, changing circumstances present new opportunities and challenges for children living with adversity. Current approaches focusing on so-called 'objective' risks neglect children's own priorities and subjective experiences. (C) 2012 The Author(s).

TI  - The implications of sugarcane contract farming on land rights, labor, and food security in the Bunyoro sub-region, Uganda
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Over the years, the Ugandan government had been promoting agricultural commercialization to become a middle-income economy by 2020. In 2012, the president remarked that if all the 40 million acres of arable land were put to full potential, everyone would be richer. Sugarcane commercialization, in the form of contract farming, has been praised as one of the preferred instruments to promote it, leading to the emergence of large and medium sugar corporations in Uganda's countryside. The study aims to provide insights into the commer-cialization process of smallholder agriculture through sugarcane contract farming (CF) and the implications on land rights, labor relations, and rural livelihoods, taking Uganda's Bunyoro sub-region as a case. To achieve this objective, the study used a qualitative approach and carried out in-depth interviews with a total of 75 partici-pants who were directly affected by the actions of the sugar production and or participated in the CF scheme (as outgrowers) as well as factory officials. The findings highlight that the wave of CF schemes around sugar, which was engineered by a convergence of power and interest between the Ugandan state and Indian capital in-vestments, adversely integrates rural farmers into sugar commodity production networks amidst unequal contractual relations, expanding agro-extractivist search for cheap land and labor rather than bringing inclusive rural development.

TI  - When should households be compensated for land-use restrictions? A decision-making framework for Chinese forest policy
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Competing uses of land mean that regulations aimed at environmental conservation often conflict with the land-use rights of rural households. Several reports suggest that this has occurred with the introduction of the Natural Forest Protection Programme (NFPP) in China, one of the world's largest logging ban programmes. This paper investigates whether households should be compensated for infringements on property rights, drawing on institutional economics literature on regulation. We distinguish between cases where regulation solves local collective action problems and increases the welfare of those affected, and those where regulation involves a redistribution of rights from one group to another. We apply this to the NFPP by estimating the net welfare impacts, using household level stated preference data with econometric techniques that explicitly account for zero and negative values of the dependent variable. We find that the ban on logging does not affect the net welfare of the affected forest communities. This indicates that the losses resulting from the restrictions on property rights are offset by the benefits from restrictions on other local households. We also find evidence that a partial reduction in logging would be welfare increasing, indicating that the NFPP is to some extent addressing local collective action problems in forest areas. Broader implications for the question of compensating for infringement of property rights as the result of regulatory interventions in contexts of institutional imperfections are also drawn.

TI  - Health payment-induced poverty under China's New Cooperative Medical Scheme in rural Shandong
T2  - HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB  - Objective To measure the incidence and severity of health payment-induced poverty of rural households under the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) in rural Shandong, China.
   Method We collected primary data from a household survey to identify catastrophic health payments and measure associated health payment-induced poverty in a county of Shandong province. From a stratified random cluster sample of 3101 households, 375 households that might be at risk of catastrophic payments were identified and interviewed. A validity test of the screening method was conducted, from which we obtained the adjusted total number of households with catastrophic payments in the sample of 3101. The health payment-induced poverty incidence and severity were compared without and with NCMS reimbursements.
   Results Before the NCMS intervention, 5.06% of the sample households fell below the national poverty line due to health payments in 2004, compared with 4.03% after reimbursements. With NCMS reimbursements, the health payment-induced poverty gap of those households still remaining below the Chinese national poverty line dropped by 19.2% to an average of 977.2 Yuan.
   Conclusion Out-of-pocket health payments remain a severe burden for rural households. Financial protection from the NCMS was limited.

TI  - Analyzing Herder Adaptive Capacity to Climate Change: A Case Study from an Ecologically Fragile Area in Inner Mongolia, People's Republic of China
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
AB  - Based on 224 face-to-face household surveys in an ecologically fragile grazing area in China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, this study analyzes herder (pastoralist) adaptive capacity for coping with climate change. The Composite Indicator Framework Method and Entropy Weighting Method were applied to calculate each herder's Adaptive Capacity Index (ACI) based on 16 indicators from seven determinants of adaptive willingness and adaptive capital. Results show that herders have an average ACI value of 0.40. Classifying herders into three groups of relatively high, medium, and low ACI values, we find that financial capital and social capital are the most significant determinants of herder adaptive capacity. Improving financial services and building herder social capital would be the most effective ways of enhancing adaptive capacity for coping with climate change. The methods and indicators developed can be generalized to other similar areas to facilitate better policy interventions for reducing poverty and improving rangeland management.

TI  - Patterns of rural collective action in contemporary China: An archetype analysis of rural construction land consolidation
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - The objective of this study is to identify and explain the underlying patterns for rural collective action based on the practices of rural construction land consolidation (RCLC) in contemporary China. To that end, an analytical framework is developed to decompose rural collective action into diagnostic attributes, design attributes and outcomes. Then, an archetype analysis is performed, and a total of eight patterns regarding the collective action for RCLC are extracted from 30 first-hand cases in eastern, central and western China. These patterns jointly demonstrate that the alignment between the diagnostic attributes of rural construction land and rural households and the design attributes of institutional mechanisms contributes to the collective action for RCLC. The research findings corroborate the classic theoretical propositions of rural collective action, including small group size, coercive power, exclusive incentives and unequal interest. More importantly, several distinctive implications are drawn: 1) the sizes, locations and quality of rural construction land raise governance demand or create favorable conditions for rural collective action; 2) despite the small group size, the government and enterprises, as external actors, still engage in RCLC motivated by their political and economic goals in the transitional context of China, and they contribute to divergent pathways to rural collective action; 3) self-governance mechanisms consisting of community control, decision-making and coordination differ to prevent opportunistic behavior, mitigate conflicts of interest and reach consensus, depending on group sizes, whether RCLC is implemented within a village group or an administrative village as well as the extent to which the social capital accumulates in a rural community; 4) given the small group size but the large area of rural construction land involved, government participation or the formal and institutionalized self-governance mechanisms with powerful rural leadership can overcome "the tragedy of the anticommons". In general, this study provides new insights into land-related rural collective action and references for subsequent research on other types of rural collective action or in other transitional countries.

TI  - Analysis of speed of improved maize (BH-540) variety adoption among smallholder farmers in Northwestern Ethiopia: count outcome model
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Low maize yield and productivity are major contributors to Ethiopia's severe food insecurity and poverty. Generous efforts have been made by various stakeholders such as producers, and governmental and non-governmental organizations, to increase the country's maize yield and productivity. However, the outcome is not as expected to achieve food security and poverty reduction. Hence, the purpose of this study was to determine factors influencing the speed of adoption of the improved maize (BH-540) variety in the Central Gondar zone. A three-stage sampling method was used to select a total of 385 smallholder farmers. Moreover, a negative binomial regression was used to determine factors influencing the speed of adopting the improved maize (BH-540) variety. The negative binomial regression model revealed that the age of the household head, farm size, and membership of the cooperative were statistically significant and positively affected the speed of adopting the improved maize (BH-540) variety, whereas distance to the nearest market and access to credit were statistically significant and inversely affected the speed of adopting the improved maize (BH-540) variety. Therefore, this study suggests that the native administration ought to organize skill division and provide short-range keeping fit packages to input suppliers, producers, traders, and development agents in each district. Moreover, supporting and strengthening the current agricultural cooperatives is advisable to strengthen farmer-to-farmer skill allotment by providing mindfulness conception, benefits, and numerous infrastructures. Furthermore, the trade and market development department should be designed to establish improved seed market institutions in each district.

TI  - New evidence regarding the effects of contract farming on agricultural labor use
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Contractual agreements between smallholder farmers and agribusiness companies have gained in importance in many developing countries. While productivity and income effects of contracting in the small farm sector were analyzed in many previous studies, labor market and employment effects are not yet well understood. This is an important research gap, especially against the background of continued population growth and structural transformation. Here, we investigate the effects of two types of contractual agreements between large international processing companies and smallholder farmers on agricultural labor use, household labor allocation, and hired labor demand in Ghana's palm oil sector. We use cross-sectional survey data and a willingness-to-pay approach to control for unobserved heterogeneity between farmers with and without contracts. We find that agricultural labor intensity is substantially reduced through the contracts, because contracting in Ghana is associated with the adoption of labor-saving procedures and technologies. Simple marketing contracts lead to reallocation of the saved household labor to off-farm employment, whereas resource-providing contracts lead to a stronger reallocation of labor within the farming enterprise. Household labor is more affected by labor savings than hired labor.

TI  - Impact of contract farming on land productivity and income of maize and potato growers in Pakistan
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - While the positive income effect of contract farming is well established in the literature, the heterogeneity of effects for different crops has not been widely investigated. This study compares the income and productivity effects of large-scale contract farming under contract schemes for potatoes and maize in Pakistan. In the area of the study, maize is a common staple crop, widely available in the market, while the potatoes produced by contract farmers are a special variety not sold in the market. We find that potato contracting is associated with significantly higher income for participating farmers, while maize contracting has no association with either income or productivity. We found no negative association between contract participation and income from other sources. Taken together, these results show a higher total household income for potato contract farmers. We also show unique evidence that potato contract farmers tend to employ more skilled workers under a salary system for the management of farms, which implies that contract farming may have positive spillover effects in the skilled labor market. Neither scheme, however, is associated with larger employment of agricultural labor for simple tasks.

TI  - Sources of agricultural information for women farmers in Tanzania
T2  - INFORMATION DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Women farmers constitute the vast majority of agricultural producers in Tanzania; however, it is not clear where they obtain information on modern farming innovations. Knowing these sources will enable the government and international aid organizations to more effectively channel information for increased productivity, leading to national food security, increased incomes for farm families and promoting gender parity in Tanzania. This study, which was carried out among 300 women farmers in Hai and Kilosa districts of Kilimanjaro and Morogoro regions respectively, aimed at identifying their sources of agricultural information. The theory that guided this study was Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations, especially Rogers and Shoemaker's Source-Message-Channel-Receiver-Effect (SMCRE) model. The study, which yielded a high response rate of 96%, found that radio and agricultural extension workers were the primary sources of agricultural information for women farmers. Therefore, the researchers recommend that the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security and Cooperatives (MAFC) should focus on community radio as the primary source of information dissemination to farmers and supply rural households with solar-powered radios free of charge or at subsidized cost. The finding that extension workers are women farmers' second main source of information on farming innovations also defeats the general contention that male extension workers are inaccessible to female farmers. A peculiar finding was that even though women farmers have access to mobile phones they do not use them to obtain agricultural information, perhaps, because the MAFC does not have a system for farmers to call in for information.

TI  - Two Major Clades of Bradyrhizobia Dominate Symbiotic Interactions with Pigeonpea in Fields of Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - In smallholder farms of Cote d'Ivoire, particularly in the northeast of the country, Cajanus cajan (pigeonpea) has become an important crop because of its multiple beneficial facets. Pigeonpea seeds provide food to make ends meet, are sold on local markets, and aerial parts serve as forage for animals. Since it fixes atmospheric nitrogen in symbiosis with soil bacteria collectively known as rhizobia, C. cajan also improves soil fertility and reduces fallow time. Yet, seed yields remain low mostly because farmers cannot afford chemical fertilizers. To identify local rhizobial strains susceptible to be used as bio-inoculants to foster pigeonpea growth, root nodules were collected in six fields of three geographically distant regions of Cote d'Ivoire. Nodule bacteria were isolated and characterized using various molecular techniques including matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and DNA sequencing. These molecular analyses showed that 63 out of 85 nodule isolates belonged to two major Glades of bradyrhizobia, one of which is known as the Bradyrhizobium elkanii super Glade. Phylogenies of housekeeping (16S-ITS-23S, rpoB) and symbiotic (nifH) genes were not always congruent suggesting that lateral transfer of nitrogen fixation genes also contributed to define the genome of these bradyrhizobial isolates. Interestingly, no field-, plant-, or cultivar-specific effect was found to shape the profiles of symbiotic strains. In addition, nodule isolates CI-1B, CI-36E, and CI-41A that belong to distinct species, showed similar symbiotic efficiencies suggesting that any of these strains might serve as a proficient inoculant for C. cajan.

TI  - Renegotiating gender roles and cultivation practices in the Nepali mid-hills: unpacking the feminization of agriculture
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - The feminization of agriculture narrative has been reproduced in development literature as an oversimplified metric of empowerment through changes in women's labor and managerial roles with little attention to individuals' heterogeneous livelihoods. Grounded in feminist political ecology (FPE), we sought to critically understand how labor and managerial feminization interact with changing agricultural practices. Working with a local NGO as part of an international, donor-funded research-for-development project, we conducted semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and participant observation with over 100 farmers in Mid-Western Nepal in 2017. Household structure and headship are dynamic in the context of male out-migration, pushing women to take on new agricultural duties and increasing household labor responsibilities. In this context, decision-making processes related to agricultural management and new cultivation practices illustrate ongoing renegotiations of gender and cultivation practices within and beyond the household. We contend that the heterogeneity of household power dynamics muddies the empowering impacts of migration and emphasize the importance of community spaces as a locus of subjectivity formation and social value. We conclude that FPE can illuminate complexities of power, space, and individual responses to socio-ecological conditions that challenge the current feminization of agriculture framework.

TI  - Local economic development: New generations of actors, policies and instruments for Africa
T2  - PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
CP  - International Symposium on Decentralisation and Local Governance in Africa
AB  - As decentralisation advances, the question of local economic development acquires more significance. How can local governments and other local actors such as local producers and their associations, community based organisations, as well as NGOs and donors contribute to local economic development and poverty reduction? This article begins by examining how the context for local economic development has drastically changed. It stresses lack of demand And the absence of meso-level institutions, i.e. institutions at the level of sector and area. Their absence deters investment responses by enterprises and households. In terms of local development initiatives, a distinction is made between community economic development and enterprise or business development. The first seeks to facilitate household economic diversification as an essential strategy of rural and urban livelihood; the second, enterprise development, seeks specialisation of the local economic base. These two lines are complemented by a third category, namely locality development, designed to create local public goods and positive externalities. The final section elaborates on the principal actors and their roles, stressing the importance of joint action and collective learning. Local governments have an important facilitating role, creating a favourable business environment and infrastructure conditions, and to contribute to convergence in decision-making.

TI  - Role of cooperative companies in sustainable rice production and poverty alleviation in Guilan state of Iran
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - This study was conducted in the districts of Guilan state of Iran to assess the impact of cooperative companies on the economic condition of rice farmers in the Guilan state. The research was conducted in the 2005 to 2007 periods. Three hundred respondents were selected for the study comprising equal number of participants and non-participants of producer cooperatives. Data were collected using survey questionnaire with a reliability test of 88% using Kronback Alfa Coefficient. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results showed that there were significant differences between members and non-members with respect to the production rate of paddy, income gained through sale of rice, level of participation, reduction of unemployment, increment of annual income and technical knowledge. Also, there was a positive correlation between the rate of paddy production per hectare with income resulting from the sale thereof, the income resulting from each hectare of the rice field with the annual income of the farmer, annual income of the farmer and rate of paddy produced and on participation in training courses and the production rate of paddy. According to above points, cooperative companies have a basic role in achievement sustainable rice production and reduction of poverty in Guilan state of Iran, thus cooperative companies should be organized and supported by government.

TI  - Changing Agro-Pastoral Livelihoods under Collective and Private Land Use in Xinjiang, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - After the founding of P. R. China, land use in rural China was organized under two successive paradigms: state-directed collectivization from 1958-1984 (the Collective Era), and privatization after 1984 (the Household Land Contract Period, HLCP). Taking Nileke County of Xinjiang as a case study, this research analyzed the livelihood changes of agro-pastoralists over the two periods using quantitative household livelihood assets-financial, physical, natural, human, and social capital-as indicators. Using annual series data of the five livelihood capitals, a comprehensive livelihood assets index (CLAI) was calculated by two-stage factor analysis. Higher CLAI scores meant better living and reduced poverty for agro-pastoralists. Quantitative results were validated and detailed with semi-structured household interviews. The results showed that CLAI slightly increased during the HLCP in comparison to the Collective Era, mainly due to increases in financial and physical capital. In contrast, natural and social capital showed downward trends, indicating that alleviation of poverty came at the cost of natural resources and social justice. Natural capital was the main contributor to agro-pastoralist livelihoods during the Collective Era, but diminished and was replaced by financial capital during the HLCP. Based on the findings, we put forward policy suggestions to improve community land management and sustainable livelihoods as part of future poverty alleviation efforts.

TI  - How off-farm work drives the intensity of rural households' investment in forest management: The case from Zhejiang, China
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - China's new round of forest tenure reform since 2006 has devolved the land-use rights of collective forests to individual households. Since then, policymakers have advocated household forestland transfers and large-scale forest holdings to increase the efficiency and returns from forest management. At the same time, there has been a rapid growth in off-farm working opportunities in urban areas of China. It is therefore important to analyze the impact of this increase in off-farm employment on the forest management investments of households with different scales of forestland holding. Based on the framework of the new economics of labor migration theory (NELM) and data obtained from surveying 300 households in 5 rural counties in Zhejiang Province, alternative econometric models were used to estimate how off-farm work drives the intensity of rural households investments in forest management. The findings reveal that households with large-scale forestland holdings (LHs) are usually willing to increase their investments in forest management due to the remittance effect of their off-farm employment. In contrast, households with small-scale forestland holdings (SHs) prefer to decrease their investments in forest management due to the out-migration effect of the growing off-farm employment opportunities. The results provide a clear explanation about the necessity of large-scale forest management under the backdrop of increasing out-migration of the labor force in China's rural areas. The paper concludes with recommendations for policymakers to develop initiatives that will promote and support large-scale forest management by households in rural China.

TI  - Credit, tenancy choice and agricultural efficiency: Evidence from the northern region of Bangladesh
T2  - ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY
AB  - Using both household level and plot-level data from Northern Bangladesh, this paper analyzes the difference in agricultural productivity across different contractual arrangements among ultra-poor households. Employing the fixed-effect model on the pseudo panel data, the paper finds evidence of sub-optimal use of inputs and, consequently, lower productivity for lands cultivated under sharecropping contracts. The inefficiency on the part of sharecroppers is also evident from the stochastic frontier model. Although the paper finds that credit has no direct impact on productivity, the results of Logit estimates suggest that availability of credit induces households to opt for fixed-rental contracts.

AB  - Coffee growers and processing firms in Costa Rica have developed a broad range of strategies since 1989 to face successive market crises, instability, and relatively somber or at least very uncertain prospects. Individual decisions have often been combined into complex household-level, collective, and corporate strategies with widely differing outcomes and degrees of success. Results attained by smallholders, cooperatives, and private firms must be understood in the context of the overall behavior of the coffee sector in this country and the historical experience of coffee producers.

TI  - Smallholder farmers' willingness to pay for scale-appropriate farm mechanization: Evidence from the mid-hills of Nepal
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - This paper analyzes smallholder farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) for the purchase of scale-appropriate farm mechanization in the hill ecologies of Nepal using the case of mini-tiller technology: a small, 5-7 horsepower two-wheel tractor primarily used for agricultural land preparation. Using primary survey data from 628 randomly-selected households, we find that farm size, local wage rates, out-migration, access to credit services, and associations with agricultural cooperatives positively influence the WTP for mini-tillers while the number of draft animals owned negatively influence the WTP for mini-tillers. On average, farmers were willing to pay 31% less than the actual price of a mini-tiller. Results also exhibited a heterogeneous demand in which the lowest quartile farm size households, typically the poorest farm households, were willing to pay 26% less for the minitiller than the top quartile of farms. In the context of labor scarcity and rising rural wages, agricultural policy on farm mechanization in Nepal should aim to prioritize small farms through robust service provision models in order to increase the level of farm mechanization in the country.

TI  - Farmer -led institutional innovations in managing smallholder irrigation schemes in KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape Provinces, South Africa
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB  - Farmer-led institutional innovations have been touted as the key to improving the management of water re-sources in irrigation schemes. However, little is known about them in South Africa. This study documents institutional innovations by 28 farmer groups located on four irrigation schemes in KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape provinces, South Africa. Induced institutional innovation theory, Ostrom?s eight design principles, and thematic analysis of interview transcripts were used to analyse the data. The study results show that 21 groups engaged in institutional innovations, indicating high levels of farmer-led innovative activity among these irri-gators. Examples of innovations include, among others, the introduction of a secret voting system to improve participation of marginalised people in decision-making processes, designing daily rotation rosters to reduce conflicts, as well as using an attendance register for participation in group activities, and rewarding members according to their participation levels. The majority of these innovations were designed to improve the graduated sanction mechanism (22.2%), enhancing the penalty system for non-compliance; improving collective action arrangements (27.8%); monitoring attendance of group meetings (18.5%); democratising decision making; and ensuring equitable water distribution. These innovations focused mainly on addressing challenges, rather than exploiting opportunities, and were mostly incremental (94%), involving an adjustment or reinterpretation of rules and regulations. Radical institutional innovations constituted only 6%. The innovative groups were smaller in size and experienced less conflict than the non-innovative groups. Both groups had low levels of education and were mostly dominated by female farmers. The study recommends that the government should build on the agency of the irrigators to improve the effectiveness and legitimacy of institutional arrangements in irrigation schemes. The study?s findings suggest that small groups should be actively promoted, while tailored training should be offered based on the groups? specific needs, to improve institutional innovations in the smallholder irrigation sector in South Africa.

TI  - The Random Quantity Mechanism: Laboratory and Field Tests of a Novel Cost-Revealing Procurement Mechanism
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - Information on private costs can improve the efficiency of programs that provide payment for environmental services in contexts involving information asymmetries and heterogeneous private costs. Using data from laboratory and field experiments, this paper presents and evaluates a novel private cost revealing mechanism, termed the random quantity mechanism (RQM), that can advance research in conservation contracting, payments for environmental services, and other similar settings. We examine the RQM's performance in a laboratory setting using induced costs and report results obtained from the first field implementation of this mechanism, with smallholder farmers in Zambia. We show that the RQM is incentive-compatible, that participant decision-making maximizes expected payoffs, and that the mechanism provides non-parametric estimates of private costs. The paper contributes to economic field studies by introducing a new incentive-compatible mechanism that elicits individuals' minimum willingness to accept across intensive margins, enabling researchers to estimate the supply of a service or commodity, and provides for exogenous variation in contract terms, which can aid in separately identifying the impacts of incentives and of participants' willingness to accept on contract outcomes.

TI  - Impacts of farmers' participation in social capital networks on climate change adaptation strategies adoption in Nigeria
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Most studies on climate change adaptation strategies adoption have focused on economic factors with little or no attention to the impact of collective actions and social capital networks. This paper investigates how farmers' participation in social capital networks influenced climate change adaptation strategies adoption in Nigeria. This study was carried out in the South-western Nigeria. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, binary probit regression, multinomial logit regression, endogenous switching regression and multinomial endogenous switching regression models. The results suggest that significant differences exist in the years of membership in the social capital networks, access to weather information and market between farm managers who adopted climate change adaptation strategies and those who did not. Plot managers who adopted climate change adaptation strategies are found to have obtained much mean yield and farm revenue than their counterparts. The results further show that participation in the social capital networks does not only significantly influence plot manager's decision to adopt but also influences the choice of climate change adaptation strategies adopted by farmers. The study concludes that a farmer who chooses to participate in social capital networks has a higher level of adopting climate change adaptation strategies than what a random farmer would have had in Nigeria. We recommend that policies aimed at increasing the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies among farmers should be channelled through locally organised farmers-based social capital networks.

TI  - Unofficial Hanoians: Migration, Native Place and Urban Citizenship in Vietnam
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY
AB  - Independent migration to Hanoi has surged dramatically over two decades of deepening market reforms, blurring the distinctions between urban and rural lives once maintained so carefully by the Communist Party of Vietnam. However many urban migrants face ongoing legal and social obstacles in Hanoi, tied to an outmoded system of household registration (ho khau), and widespread anxieties about the floating population' threatening to overwhelm the city. This article shows how one group of unofficial Hanoians'migrant motorbike taxi drivers from Nam Dinh Provincenavigate a system of differentiated urban citizenship by forging communities and mutual assistance networks around shared native places' (que huong) to find employment, housing and social support in the city. It also reveals how Hanoi's marginal urban spaceshome to entrenched migrant communities of ambiguous legalityemerge as key arenas in the negotiation of Vietnamese citizenship, forcing national leaders, city officials, landlords and residents to grapple with questions of free movement and the rights of rural citizens to transgress urban space.

TI  - Impact of outsourced agricultural extension program on smallholder farmers' net farm income in Msinga, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - This paper examines the determinants of participation in an outsourced extension programs and its impact of smallholder farmers' net farm income in Msinga, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to obtain cross-sectional farm-level data from a sample of 300 farm households, using a structured questionnaire for the interview. The determinants and impacts of participation were estimated using the propensity score matching (PSM) to account for sample selection bias. The results show that participation in an outsourced extension program is influenced by age, education, membership of a farmers' group, and off-farm income, farm size, awareness, trust and participation incentives. Participation in an outsourced extension program was found to have significantly contributed to an increase in net farm income of the participants by about R2700. Policy implications for scaling up outsourced extension service delivery are discussed.

TI  - Do coffee cooperatives benefit farmers? An exploration of heterogeneous impact of coffee cooperative membership in Southwest Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Smallholder farmers' participation in agricultural cooperatives is often promoted as a promising strategy for overcoming market imperfections and to increase farmers' productivity and income. In recognition of this potential, in recent years, Ethiopia has shown renewed interest in promoting cooperatives. However, there is lack of empirical evidence of the impact that cooperatives have on farmers' performance in Ethiopia. Using a matching technique, we evaluate the impact of coffee cooperatives on the performance of their member households in terms of income and coffee production. We use data from coffee farmers in south-west Ethiopia. The overall results suggest that members of cooperatives are not faring much better than non-members. The treatment effects we measured were not statistically significant from zero. Yet, the aggregate figures mask differences between cooperatives and amongst individual cooperative members. Average treatment effects on members differ between cooperatives, in general older members, those who have benefitted from more education and those with larger coffee plantations seem to benefit more from membership. Our analysis sheds light on the heterogeneity in the impact that membership of a cooperative can have: this differs by cooperative and by members within cooperatives, a finding that has important policy implications.

TI  - Efficiency of Decisions under Membership Heterogeneity and Government Regulations: Insights from Farmer Cooperatives in China
T2  - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE
AB  - The Cooperative Law, passed in 2007, aims to support and regulate farmer cooperatives in China. The adoption of its regulations is uneven, with most regulations followed except the one-person, one-vote rule. We model investment decisions of Chinese cooperatives and measure the efficiency of capital allocation under heterogeneous membership and alternative governance policies. We show that relative membership heterogeneity in equity and patronage holdings and a cooperative's dividend policy are crucial in determining the optimal level of governance centralization. Centralizing the governance to major equity holders and following other regulations reflect a trade-off faced by cooperatives between obtaining financial support from the government and achieving efficient decision-making.

TI  - Increasing egg availability through smallholder business models in East Africa and India
T2  - MATERNAL AND CHILD NUTRITION
AB  - Availability and consumption of eggs, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, is low despite their apparent benefits. We investigated constraints in egg production in four countries; Kenya, Ethiopia, Malawi, and India and identified five business models that are viable and sustainable. They are (a) micro-franchising, (b) microfinancing, (c) co-operative farming, (d) enterprise development, and (e) out-grower model. All of them involve smallholder farmers to increase egg production. These farmers have access to soft loans and use improved inputs and extension services to varying degrees. Inputs include resilient breeds of day-old chicks or point-of-lay hens, feed, vaccines, medicines, and housing. Outgrower and enterprise development models have a significant potential of rapidly increasing egg yields, achieve self-sufficiency, operate at or near scale, and provide a high income for the farmers. This study shows how a range of actors in commercial, not-for-profit and microfinance sectors with specialized skills, can facilitate the transformation of the egg production sector. Specific skills include brooding (hatchery operations), feed milling, aggregation, and training of smallholder farmers or large-scale rearing. The five archetypes we describe here are promising ways to increase egg availability in rural areas.

By adopting a Bourdieusian framework to analyse interview data collected from fathers, mothers, sons and daughters in 10 rural Punjabi households, we expose the intersections of education, gender, poverty and rurality. The concept of a rural family habitus focuses attention on the collective, relational and dispositional worlds of such families. Three dimensions are used to analyse reproduction and transformation in each narrative set: intergenerational educational dynamics; on-going gender dynamics; and, social dynamics within the rural field. The findings challenge the stereotyping and assumed homogeneity of rural families whose gender cultures and positive educational dispositions are diverse and complex. The gendered histories of parental education, their aspirations, and their social status in the rural field intersect with the changing gender relations which result from schooling, and the increasing differentiation between educated and uneducated rural families.

TI  - Contribution of ecosystem services to rural livelihoods in a changing landscape: A case study from the Eastern Himalaya
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Ecosystem services (ES), or tangible and intangible goods and services from nature, are an integral part of the rural economy in Nepal. However, there is limited recognition of their contribution to human wellbeing. To understand the linkages between local people and ES, an integrated assessment based on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment framework was undertaken in Rautamai Rural Municipality of Udayapur District, Eastern Nepal. The study applied three broad approaches and multiple tools. This included a set of participatory tools (10 focus group discussions and 36 key informant interviews), followed by a household survey (439 households), and complemented by geospatial tools. The study identified three major ecosystems, namely forest ecosystems, agroecosystems, and freshwater ecosystems on which over 75% households were dependent for their livelihood. Collectively, these ecosystems provide 27 provisioning services, 14 regulating, 6 cultural, and 4 supporting services. Among the three ecosystems, the forest ecosystem provides the maximum number of services (40%). However, about 69% households depend on agro-ecosystems as their primary source of livelihoods. There have been subtle changes in land use over the last 18 years, which has had notable impacts on the flow of ecosystem services, and it reflected in people's perceptions. The study highlights the importance of ecosystem services and the implications of land use change on the flow of these services and wellbeing of people in rural Nepal. The findings of this study will be instrumental for land use planning and incentive-based conservation being planned by Nepal aimed at building socio-ecological resilience.

TI  - How do climbing beans fit in fanning systems of the eastern highlands of Uganda? Understanding opportunities and constraints at farm level
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Climbing beans offer potential for sustainable intensification in the East-African highlands, but their introduction requires a major change in the cropping system compared with the commonly grown bush bean. We explored farm-level opportunities, constraints and trade-offs for climbing bean cultivation in the eastern highlands of Uganda. We established current food self-sufficiency, income, investment costs and labour, and assessed the ex-ante, farm-level impact of four climbing bean options on these indicators. Input for this assessment were a detailed characterization of 16 farms of four types, and on-farm, experimental data of adaptation trials of climbing bean. Climbing beans generally improved food self-sufficiency and income, but often required increased financial investment and always demanded more labour than current farm configurations. Opportunities for integration of climbing beans on small farms were limited. Although some of the poorest farmers accrued the largest absolute benefits from climbing beans, their ability to make the necessary investments is questionable. The analysis was translated into a simple-to-use modelling tool to enable participatory analysis of the outcomes with farmers of the four farm types to understand their perspectives and decision-making. The discussions revealed a recent increase in market prices for climbing bean resulting in growing interest in their cultivation in the eastern highlands. A lack of seed and stakes was limiting climbing bean cultivation, and a sufficient amount of climbing bean seed needs to be ensured through strengthening of farmer cooperatives and improved storage.

TI  - Smartphone use and income growth in rural China: empirical results and policy implications
T2  - ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH
AB  - The diffusion of mobile information and communication technologies (ICTs) has important implications for rural economic development. Many studies have investigated the potential contributions of mobile ICTs to agricultural production and poverty reduction, but have failed to consider the wider income effects of the use of updated ICTs, such as smartphones. Our findings, based on household-level survey data from rural China and an endogenous switching regression model, indicate that gender, farmers' education, farm size, and off-farm work participation are the main drivers of smartphone use. Further, we find that smartphone use increases farm income, off-farm income and household income substantially and there is a statistically significant difference in the income effects between male and female users of smartphones. Possible policy interventions from our findings include: (1) support to increase use of smartphones by households headed by women; and (2) a 'win-win' approach to rural development that includes improved hard (roads) and soft (education) infrastructure and encompasses the increased use of smartphones so as to increase both off-farm employment opportunities and farm and off-farm incomes.

TI  - The impact of coffee certification on small-scale producers' livelihoods: a case study from the Jimma Zone, Ethiopia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - What is the impact of product certification on small-scale farmers livelihoods? To what extent does the participation of Ethiopian small-scale coffee farmers in certified local cooperative structures improve their socioeconomic situation? To answer these questions, this article employs household data of 249 coffee farmers from six different cooperatives collected in the Jimma zone of Southwestern Ethiopia in 2009. Findings show that the certification of coffee cooperatives has in total a low impact on small-scale coffee producers livelihoods mainly due to (1) low productivity, (2) insignificant price premium, and (3) poor access to credit and information from the cooperative. Differences in production and organizational capacities between the local cooperatives are mirrored in the extent of the certification benefits for the smallholders. Good cooperatives have reaped the benefits of certification, whereas bad ones did not fare well. In this regard the cooperative effect overlies the certification effect.

TI  - The Impact of Off-Farm Employment on Farmland Production Efficiency: An Empirical Study Based in Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - The secret to ensuring food security and the growth of agricultural development is farmland production efficiency. In the context of urbanization, this means that farmers need to increase their off-farm employment behavior. The research goal of this paper is to explore whether this will have a impact on farmland production. This paper is based on the data of the China Land Economic Survey conducted by Nanjing Agricultural University and uses Tobit and other methods to conduct empirical tests. The main findings of this paper are as follows: (1) When the proportion of the household's off-farm employment time is less than 73%, an increase in off-farm employment reduces farmland production efficiency. When the proportion of the household's off-farm employment time exceeds 73%, an increase in off-farm employment increases the farmland production efficiency. (2) This paper eliminates the scale efficiency contribution in farmland production efficiency to obtain pure technical production efficiency. After verification, off-farm employment and farmland pure technical production efficiency show a U-shaped correlation and the inflection points of the two U-shaped curves coincide. (3) The reason for the inflection point is that after the off-farm employment of farmers reaches the inflection point, with a further increase in off-farm employment, the renting-out behavior of farmland increases and there is increased input of labor-saving technology in agricultural land production, because of which the production efficiency and pure technical efficiency of the farmland increase. To sum up, off-farm employment does not necessarily mean reduced farmland production efficiency. Farmland leasing behavior plays a key role in mitigating the impact of off-farm employment on farmland production. Therefore, in the process of urbanization, the improvement of the land transfer market, the development of agricultural socialized services, and the promotion of cooperative operation will help to ensure the productivity of farmland.

TI  - REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE WITH PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP IN THE IRRIGATION SUBSECTOR
T2  - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
AB  - ABSTRACT
   Over the last few years, the number of initiatives of public-private partnerships in irrigation has increased significantly. PPPs have been developed to accelerate irrigation expansion, improve operation & maintenance services, and eliminate or reduce O&M subsidies. This paper shares the lessons learned from the experiences of the 'pioneer' countries, reviewing: (i) recent PPP transactions under implementation (Morocco, Peru and Ethiopia) and (ii) some transactions under preparation (Brazil, Morocco and Ethiopia).
   The main lessons learned to date for the promotion and development of PPPs in irrigation cover the following areas:
   an analysis of what constitutes a favourable environment to promote and develop a PPP, considering the potentially conflicting objectives of farmers, public and private sectors. This paper illustrates that the PPP model (with financial contribution of a private party to the CAPEX, capital investment) is more appropriate for new and modern irrigation schemes with solid irrigation services demand from commercial farmers, while other designs of private sector involvement, like management contracts, should be considered when conditions are different (smallholders with subsistence agriculture, etc.);
   a description of good and bad practices for transaction design to reduce demand and payment risk and to increase attractiveness of the operation;
   a discussion on the intrinsic role of PPP in irrigation, advising not to consider it as a new 'panacea' but rather as an additional tool to be used cautiously and only when some specific conditions are met. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Collaborative Governance: Analysing Social Audits in MGNREGA in India
T2  - IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - In the history of social protection programmes in India, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is the most expansive and ambitious programme ever. In 2009/10 alone, over 380 billion rupees (US$8 billion) were spent to employ over 50 million households under this scheme. To oversee such expansive coverage, an elaborate monitoring and evaluation system has been enshrined in the law. It was also realised that non-state actors need to be included in the monitoring process for collective accountability and ensuring transparency. Social audits are unique collaborative governance mechanisms which are not only participatory programme evaluation exercises but also lead to empowerment of the poor. They are a platform for the vulnerable to raise their 'voice' and assert their 'rights'; to hold the administration accountable and assume collective responsibility, thereby potentially transforming social protection to social justice. This article analyses the social audit framework from a policy design perspective, in light of field reports and recent changes in the rules and aims, to unravel why, despite the merits, it is not yet the 'magic silver bullet' for poverty alleviation.

TI  - As You Sow, So Shall You Reap: The Welfare Impacts of Contract Farming
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Contract farming is widely perceived as a means of increasing welfare in developing countries. Because of smallholder self-selection in contract farming, however, it is not clear whether contract farming actually increases grower welfare. In an effort to improve upon existing estimates of the welfare impacts of contract farming, this paper uses the results of a contingent-valuation experiment to control for unobserved heterogeneity among smallholders. Using data across several regions, firms, and crops in Madagascar, results indicate that a I-percent increase in the likelihood of participating in contract farming is associated with a 0.5-percent increase in household income, among other positive impacts.

TI  - Gender Inequality and the Oppression of Women within Minangkabau Matrilineal Society: A Case Study of the Management of Ulayat Forest Land in Nagari Bonjol, Dharmasraya District, West Sumatra Province, Indonesia
T2  - ASIAN WOMEN
AB  - Gender inequality within the Melayu clan of a Minangkabau matrilineal community in Dharmasraya District, West Sumatra Province in Indonesia, leads to the clan's women experiencing injustice when it comes to the management of communal forest land (ulayat). This inequality is most clearly shown in situations in which men sell communal forest land for their own personal interests. Moreover, the distribution of nucleus estate smallholder oil palm plantation (NESHP) plots disadvantages women. Although these plots are supposed to be distributed fairly among community members, the system used is controlled by the male communal ruler, who holds rights over the community as a whole. The practices used to manage ulayat forestland within the Melayu clan prove that women within the matrilineal system used by the Minangkabau group, of which the Melayu clan is a part, are not treated equally in terms of the management of natural resources. This inequality arises due to an imbalance that exists between men and women over the rights they have to manage the ulayat forest. The findings of this study challenge previous studies which have suggested that gender inequality is mainly an issue within patrilineal societies; the finding suggests that it also occurs within matrilineal systems such as within the Melayu clan in Bonjol village.

TI  - Perceived water-related risk factors of Buruli ulcer in two villages of south-central Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background
   Buruli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is a neglected tropical skin disease that is primarily endemic in West and Central Africa, including Cote d'Ivoire. Studies indicate that M. ulcerans infections are caused by contact with an environmental reservoir of the bacteria, governed by specific human biological conditions. Yet, the nature of this reservoir and the exact mode of transmission remain unknown.
   Methodology
   To identify ecologic risk factors of Buruli ulcer in south-central Cote d'Ivoire, we pursued a qualitative study matched with geo-referencing inquiry. Embedded in a broader integrated wound management research project, we (i) mapped households and water sources of laboratory confirmed Buruli ulcer cases and (ii) interviewed 12 patients and four health care workers to assess exposure to surface water and to deepen the understanding of perceived transmission pathways.
   Principal findings
   Water availability, accessibility, and affordability were reported as key determinants for choosing water resources. Furthermore, perceived risks were related to environmental, structural, and individual factors. Despite the presence of improved water sources (e.g., drilled wells), communities heavily relied on unprotected surface water for a multitude of activities. The nearby Bandama River and seasonal waterbodies were frequently used for washing, bathing, and collection of water for drinking and cooking. Many residents also reported to cross the river on a daily basis for agricultural chores, and hence, are exposed to stagnant water during farming activities.
   Conclusions/significance
   Our study in two Buruli ulcer endemic villages in south-central Co te d'Ivoire revealed a wide range of water-related domestic activities that might expose people to an increased risk of contracting the disease. Environmental, biological, social, and cultural risk factors are closely interlinked and should be considered in future investigations of Buruli ulcer transmission. Active participation of the communities is key to better understand their circumstances to advance research and fight against Buruli ulcer and other neglected tropical diseases.
   Author summary
   Buruli ulcer is a bacterial skin disease, which is endemic in West and Central Africa. The disease mostly affects children and can progress to large lesions primarily located on upper and lower limbs. While current evidence suggests that the causative bacterium, Mycobacterium ulcerans, is hosted in aquatic environments, the exact transmission route is still not clear. In our study, we investigated two endemic villages in the south-central part of Cote d'Ivoire. Framed in a larger research initiative, we mapped households and water sources of Buruli ulcer cases. Additionally, we interviewed people with Buruli ulcer as well as health care workers about water contact patterns and perceived risk factors. Despite drilled wells installed in the villages, the nearby river (Bandama), seasonal ponds, and low-lands are key water resources for the residents. Our research revealed a variety of activities where people get in touch with water that are related to domestic and subsistence work. Environmental, social, and cultural risk factors were mentioned, underlining the complexity on the local level. We conclude that the communities' perspective and their knowledge must be considered in future research to reduce the burden of Buruli ulcer and other neglected tropical diseases.

TI  - Peasant Resistance in Burkina Faso's Cotton Sector
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIAL HISTORY
AB  - This article examines how and why smallholder peasants mobilize for collective action to put forward their claims. Taking the resistance by cotton farmers in Burkina Faso as a case study, it demonstrates that institutions of neoliberal governance - which are presented by their proponents as making governance more "effective" by improving the participation of various public and private stakeholders in different degrees - nevertheless fail to represent the interests of the large population of agrarian poor. In the 2010s, the cotton sector in Burkina Faso became a field of contention, with smallholder cotton producers mobilizing on a massive scale to take collective action. It is argued that the mobilization of cotton farmers can be explained through the effects of the sector's liberalization. Economic liberalization, which has been promoted by the World Bank since the mid-1990s, has changed the institutional setting of the sector and has significantly impacted the ways and means of collective claim-making available to farmers. Building on primary data (qualitative interviews, focus group discussions, observations) collected during several months of field research between 2018 and 2020, and analyses of press reports and a variety of documents, recent protests by cotton farmers are examined and related to these liberalization policies.

TI  - The Impact of Collective Forestland Tenure Reform on Rural Households' Inputs: Moderating Effects Based on Off-Farm Employment
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Collective Forestland Tenure Reform has confirmed the forestland tenure of rural households and made forestland property rights clearer. In order to explain whether this policy is effective in improving rural households' expected returns and sense of forestland tenure security, we built models to study the impact of off-farm employment on forestland input in the context of labor migration to urban areas. We used data from the rural household tracking survey conducted by the Development Research Center of the National Forestry and Grassland Bureau from 2003-2016, which includes nine provinces (districts) and 1227 sample rural households in China. Regression models with the forestland titling program as the key influencing factor were constructed, controlling for household characteristics, household head characteristics, forestland characteristics, village level characteristics, market characteristics, and policy factors. Forestland leases had no significant on cash outlays and labor inputs. Forest tenure mortgage loans had a significant positive effect on cash outlays and labor inputs. For households' off-farm employment, the moderating effects of labor migration on labor inputs and cash outlays are modeled separately. The study indicated that the forestland tenure titling certificates increase households' enthusiasm in forestland production and promote cash outlays and labor inputs in forestland management. The results regarding the moderating effect indicated that labor migration has a positive moderating effect on rural households' forestland inputs including labor inputs and cash outlays.

TI  - Impact of livelihood capital endowment on poverty alleviation of households under rural land consolidation
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Poverty eradication is the primary goal of equitable and sustainable development and has received extensive attention from the international academic community. Rural land consolidation (RLC) is designed to achieve sustainable land use by combining land system reform and policy innovation; this has become an important means to promote China's poverty alleviation. From the perspective of micro-farmers, this paper takes the Sustainable Livelihood Approach (SLA) to reveal the influence of livelihood capital endowment on households' income growth and poverty alleviation under different modes of RLC. According to the survey data of registered poor households in four counties (cities) of Hubei Province and Guizhou Province, this paper uses fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to empirically study several combinations of initial livelihood capital endowment after the implementation of different modes of RLC. The results show that RLC improves households' initial livelihood capital endowment, reduces the vulnerability of the livelihood, thus promoting the accumu-lation of households' livelihood capital and the optimization of livelihood strategies and urging households to obtain a sustainable livelihood, so as to contribute to poverty alleviation. Whether in the government-dominated mode area or Public-Private Partnership(PPP)mode area, the five types of livelihood capital endowments of households are interdependent and collectively affect income growth and poverty alleviation. However, the requirements for households' initial livelihood capital endowments are far lower after the implementation of PPP mode RLC than those after the implementation of government-dominated RLC. Based on these findings, this paper presents corresponding policy recommendations to improve the effectiveness of RLC poverty alleviation policy, and also provides China's experience and reference for other developing countries to formulate targeted antipoverty policies.

TI  - Dynamics of decline in small-scale sugarcane production in South Africa: Evidence from two 'rural' wards in the Umfolozi region
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Using evidence from two rural wards in the Umfolozi region, this paper critically investigates the dynamics and constraints of small-scale sugarcane production under conditions of decline. The rapid decline in small-scale sugarcane production was historically underwritten by regulatory reforms that paired processes of enhanced representational inclusion with measures of rationalisation, resulting in deteriorating terms of exchange and the retraction of intensive interventions in production by sugar millers (Dubb, 2015). It is argued that, together with drought, these changes severely undermined the efficiency of capital services offered by local tractor-owning contractors and the productivity of small growers as a whole, while social grants have acted as a barrier to intensifying the exploitation of neighbours. The resultant cost-price squeeze has rendered cane an increasingly unattractive site of investment of labour and wages, and witnessed the severe decline or exit of most growers. For some, social grants have nonetheless provided a consumptive base from which to commit homestead labour without drawing down on cane proceeds, and hence enabled them to 'hang in' or marginally 'creep-back' into production. Only contractor-growers have managed to increase production, but this in turn is premised on the precarious cross-subsidization of their dual enterprises. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - To sell, not to sell, or to quit: Exploring milk producers' approaches after a supply chain disruption in Northwest Cameroon
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The Northwest is the second largest milk producing region of Cameroon. In Bamenda, the region's capital, the shutdown of the only milk processing plant in mid-2016 and political unrest later that year disrupted its dairy supply chain. Producers had to decide whether to continue selling milk, to momentarily stop selling milk, or to quit the dairy business entirely. We investigate the approaches considered by producers in response to the supply chain disruption using household survey data from 2017 with 320 active and inactive dairy market participants. By means of binary and multinomial logit models, we examine household characteristics, farm resources, and institutional factors that may have driven producers' responses one year after the disruption. Our analysis reveals that pastoral and sedentary milk producers should be examined separately. Results show that livestock diversity, land titles, and dairy-focused trainings are helpful to sedentary producers to continue milk sales, whereas pastoral sellers are encouraged by greater access to production factors, and by being members of cooperatives. Generally, younger producers in non-urban areas are most likely to remain milk sellers, regardless of production system. This study sheds light on producers' different approaches after supply chain disruptions and highlights farm-level factors that help them stabilize and maintain their livelihoods. This knowledge can contribute to the design of more appropriate mitigation strategies against the repercussions of such events in the future, particularly for cattle and dairy development programs.

TI  - Local droughts and income risk among Thai households
T2  - REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper investigates the extent to which households in rural Thailand across the income distribution are able to mitigate income risks in the face of shocks. It uses especially high-quality household income and consumption data spanning 64 Thai villages over 15 years. The paper identifies income shocks by village-level variations during drought conditions. It finds that richer households are better able to mitigate income risk than poorer households, in contrast to some studies of the South Asian subcontinent. These possibilities for managing income risk are shown to be correlated with the type of contract the head of household is likely to be employed in, the share of salaries in total household income, the education level of the head, the relative youth of the heads of richer households, and location effects.

TI  - The economic impacts of agricultural cooperatives on smallholder farmers in rural China
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - This paper examines the impacts of agricultural cooperative membership on output price, gross income, farm profit, and return on investment (ROI) utilizing a recent household survey data of 481 apple producers in China. We employ a treatment effects model to account for potential selection bias that arises from the fact that cooperative members and nonmembers are systematically different in terms of both observable and unobservable factors. Our analysis reveals that cooperative membership has a positive and statistically significant impact on apple price, gross income, farm profit, and ROI. In addition, we find that the highest profit effect of cooperative membership does not in fact result in the highest ROI effect of the membership, revealing differences in farm income and profitability of investment.

TI  - The contribution of cooperative irrigation scheme to poverty reduction in Tanzania
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB  - Irrigation system is a scare resource in most of drought-stricken Africa. How to manage and maintain the existing irrigation facilities in Africa is a debatable issue to both policy makers and beneficiaries. Irrigation facilities run by farmer cooperatives are considered ineffective, unsuccessful and dysfunctional in Tanzania by many researchers. A cooperative irrigation scheme is a mechanism that features the collective management of rural irrigation facilities by farmers? cooperative with some government intervention and external support. There is an increasing emphasis on the roles of cooperative irrigation scheme in the development of the agriculture sector and poverty reduction of smallholder farmers. In this study, the authors investigated the management and services of this scheme and analyzed its contribution to poverty reduction of smallholder rice farmers and community development in Tanzania through both quantitative and qualitative methods. The results showed that the scheme helped smallholder farmers increase the rice production and brought better market opportunities. The farmers? net income was also increased. Profit generated from rice farming not only improved the livelihoods of smallholder farmers but also created more employment opportunities in the rural communities. The research also revealed that the scheme was faced with a number of challenges due to resource and institutional constraints and low-level human capacity for both management and members. The research provides a feasible approach to effective management of small-scale agricultural infrastructure for poverty reduction in Africa.

TI  - Does a joint United Nations microfinance 'plus' program empower female farmers in rural Ethiopia? Evidence using the pro-WEAI
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Microfinance is thought to be an effective tool for empowering women. Yet, previous studies that eval-uate microfinance programs have mixed findings. This is in part because there are large variations in the interventions that are evaluated, but also that there is not a standardized metric of empowerment that is implemented consistently throughout the literature. This study investigates the effectiveness of a joint United Nations program aimed at empowering rural women through women-run rural savings and credit cooperatives in Oromia, Ethiopia, using the project-Women's Empowerment in Agricultural Index. Building on more than a decade of studies and validation of different versions of the Women's Empowerment in Agricultural Index, the tool aims to provide a standardized and comparable metric of women's empowerment that is flexible enough to measure impacts of development projects. This study finds that the program had a positive impact on intrinsic agency for the beneficiaries with continued access to credit through the RUSACCOs between the baseline and endline. For this group of beneficiaries, the program seemed to increase the trust and respect between spouses. There is a second group of ben-eficiaries that appeared to have dropped out at the initial stages of the program or lost access to credit, suggesting there may have been problems with the program or possible resistance by spouses or commu-nity members. The study expands our understanding of how to measure women's empowerment impacts of development projects within the context of a smallholder agricultural households.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Spatially heterogeneous effects of collective action on environmental dependence in Namibia?s Zambezi region
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Many poor rural households depend on products from non-cultivated environments for subsistence and commercialization. Collective action schemes, such as community-based natural resource management (CBNRM), aim at maintaining natural resource quality and thus potentially contribute to the sustainabil-ity of environmental income sources. Little is known about whether and under which contextual condi-tions these schemes effectively promote environmental income generation or imply trade-offs between wildlife conservation and socioeconomic development. We rely on a unique combination of original farm-household data with a rich set of spatiotemporal covariates to quantify environmental income and dependency in Namibia's Zambezi region at the heart of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. We then estimate the effect of CBNRM on environmental income and dependency in a quasi-experimental regression-based approach. Controlling for historical variables that affected selection into formal CBNRM schemes, we further explore the role of contextual variation in exposure to tourism activity. Results suggest that CBNRM fosters livelihood strategies that are, on average, more dependent on the environment. However, this effect is driven by outcomes of households that live in close proximity to touristic enterprises, where such livelihood strategies align better with other income generating opportunities than in areas where agriculture represents the only viable economic alternative.(c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Cost-benefit efficiency and determinants of marketing channel choice by rice farmers in rural Tanzania: evidence from Mbeya Region, Tanzania
T2  - CUSTOS E AGRONEGOCIO ON LINE
AB  - Rice production is considered an increasing source of income and food security for smallholder farmers in many parts of Tanzania. Improving market access for rice farmers is essential to raise rural incomes and reducing poverty. This study aims to determine the cost-benefit efficiency of different rice marketing channels and factors affecting marketing channel choices of smallholder rice farmers. The analysis has been conducted using various efficiency indicators and Multinomial Logit Model on quantitative data collected from 213 rice farmers in Mbeya, one of the main rice production regions in Tanzania. The results showed that out of the studied channels, the miller-wholesale marketing channel is the most efficient market. Regarding the factors, the results show that although most farmers in rural areas still sell their produce to local collectors, favorable prices and reduced transaction cost due to ownership of transportation and storage facilities, access to market information, credit access, transportation infrastructure improvement, and collective action through associations influences farmers to choose better marketing channels. The findings suggest that policies aimed at improving extension services, access to productive assets, access to formal credit, improvement of rural infrastructure and post-harvest facilities, reducing transaction costs, promoting the use of farmers' production and marketing groups to access appropriate marketing information could enhance marketing efficiency and inclusion of smallholder farmers in markets.

TI  - Social transitions in the Savannah: The decline and fall of social risk management amongst Fulani in the subhumid zone of Nigeria
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to explore social risk management strategies amongst Fulani in the subhumid zone of Nigeria; and second, to determine current status and nature of reciprocal exchange networks, risk pooling and social support for pastoral livelihoods in North-Central Nigeria.
   Design/methodology/approach Surveys of cattle productivity and pastoral livelihoods were carried out amongst Fulani pastoralists on the Jos Plateau: between 2008 and 2013 using participatory epidemiology methods and the sustainable livelihoods framework. Qualitative and quantitative data on livelihood activities, knowledge, attitudes and practices of animal husbandry and disease control, wealth grouping, herd entries and exits was gathered to determine the current state of cattle productivity and pastoral livelihoods in the study area.
   Findings Results show that reciprocal exchange networks for risk management have mostly disintegrated and patron-client relationships have become an important social risk management strategy.
   Practical implications This research has significant implications for sustainability of Fulani livelihoods and communities: decreased social risk-management strategies and increased self-reliance means that the most vulnerable households will find it more difficult to withstand shocks and climb out of poverty. Wealthier households may cope better with high incidence/low severity shocks like but are more vulnerable to low incidence/high severity shocks. Likewise, decreased social cohesion reduces the ability of communities to mobilise and act collectively in the face of community-level shocks. This is very important for engagement with the state - a crucial process, given current levels of acrimony and conflict.
   Originality/value Given the high levels of farmer-herder conflict and civil unrest in this region over the past 15 years this research is valuable in providing insights into economic drivers of conflict, current dynamics of pastoral livelihoods and social cohesion within and between communities.

TI  - Impact of cooperative membership on production efficiency of smallholder goat farmers in Nepal
T2  - ANNALS OF PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - Goat is a source of cash income to smallholders in many developing countries. The productivity of goat farmers is poorly understood and assumed similar across all households. Cooperatives are hailed as an institution that can provide market power to smallholders in developing countries. We assess the impact of cooperatives on the technical efficiency of goat farmers in Nepal. Multistage sampling and in-person interviews were used to collect information from 334 nonmember and 327 member cooperative farmers from two prominent goat production districts in Nepal. We use translog production function to calculate the technical efficiency. The endogeneity associated with cooperative membership is addressed through an instrumental variable approach. The one-step analysis was used to avoid bias due to the one-sided stochastic frontier analysis error. All conventional inputs have significant and positive impact on performance. Cooperative membership shows positive and significant impact on technical efficiency. The average technical efficiency score of cooperative members was 93.2%, while of nonmembers was 90.7%, and the difference was significant. Variables positively affecting technical efficiency include number of family members in agriculture, education, and training on goat production. Cooperative membership encourages farmers to embark on commercial production, fodder tree planting, farm byproducts utilization and kitchen waste utilization.

TI  - Effect of input credit on smallholder farmers' output and income Evidence from Northern Ghana
T2  - AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of input credit on smallholder farmers' output and income using Masara N'Arziki support project in Northern Ghana. Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional primary data set was used to estimate the effect of project participation on farm output, yield and income using propensity score matching (PSM) methods.
   Findings - The findings are that project participation is skewed towards experienced farmers with big-sized households and farms. The effect of project on outcomes is somewhat unsatisfactory in the sense that participation only raises output and yield, but not income.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper only examined the project effect on farm outcomes among smallholder farmers participating in the programme in just one operational area in the Northern region. Future research should consider all the operational areas for an informed generalisation of findings.
   Practical implications - Greater benefits to farmers from programme participation would require project management to review the contractual arrangement so that the high cost of input credit is significantly reduced.
   Originality/value - The paper applied the PSM to estimate the effect of project participation on farm output, yield and income among smallholder farmers which is non-existent in the literature on the study area, at least as far as we know. This paper can inform future policy on the direction and nature of support for smallholder farmers in Northern Ghana.

TI  - Catastrophic Outpatient Health Payments and Health Payment-induced Poverty under China's New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES AND POLICY
AB  - In 2003, the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) was initiated in China to provide rural inhabitants with financial protection against health risks. The benefit package was extended to outpatient care in 2007. Using the China Health and Nutrition Survey of 2009, this paper examines the relationship between the households participating in the NCMS and the level and distribution of catastrophic health payments and health payment-induced poverty resulting from outpatient care. The study finds no significant difference in terms of catastrophic health payments and health payment-induced poverty before and after NCMS reimbursement. The out-of-pocket payments (OOP) are concentrated disproportionately among the poor even after the insurance reimbursement. This heavy burden of OOP payments has become a poverty trap for the poor. This study calls for a more comprehensive insurance and effective insurance package.

TI  - Difference in dependence on forest resources between first generation migrants and their descendants in southern Shan State, Myanmar
T2  - TROPICS
AB  - Forest resources have the potential to act as a safety net for those who live in or migrate to rural areas. The aim of this study was to assess the difference in dependence on forest resources between first generation migrants and their descendants in a village in the southern Shan State of Myanmar that includes different ethnic groups and has experienced population growth. Their perceptions of collective action for sustainable forest resource management were also analyzed. Primary data were collected through semi-structured interviews with households, interviews with key informants, and focus group discussions. The first generation had a greater diversity of income sources than the second generation; in addition, households that earned income from non-timber forest products (NTFPs) were found to have a lower total annual income than those that did not, across the generations. This result demonstrates the function of NTFPs as a safety net for rural migrants whose livelihood is dependent on forest resources. Furthermore, participation by first and second generation migrants in collective action for sustainable forest resource management was found to be low. Rather, the heterogeneity of villagers should be taken into consideration by policy makers and implementing agencies for sustainable forest resource governance.

TI  - Are Sustainable Coffee Certifications Enough to Secure Farmer Livelihoods? The Millenium Development Goals and Nicaragua's Fair Trade Cooperatives
T2  - GLOBALIZATIONS
AB  - In December 2001, green coffee commodity prices hit a 30-year low. This deepened the livelihood crisis for millions of coffee farmers and rural communities. The specialty coffee industry responded by scaling up several sustainable coffee certification programs, including Fair Trade. This study uses household-and community-level research conducted in Nicaragua from 2000 to 2006 to assess the response to the post-1999 coffee crisis. A participatory action research team surveyed 177 households selling into conventional and Fair Trade markets in 2006. In an effort to dialogue with specialty coffee industry and mainstream development agencies, results are framed within the context of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Findings suggest that households connected to Fair Trade cooperatives experienced several positive impacts in education, infrastructure investment, and monetary savings. However, several important livelihoods insecurities, including low incomes, high emigration, and food insecurity, persisted among all small-scale producers.

TI  - Does outsourcing affect agricultural productivity of farmer households? Evidence from China
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose Previous studies focused on the influence of outsourcing (labor division) on productivity, especially in the industrial economy. However, few studies have focused on how labor division in agriculture affects agricultural productivity. To bridge this gap, this study uses survey data from 4864 farmer households in China to explore the impacts of outsourcing on agricultural productivity. Design/methodology/approach This study employs an endogenous switching regression to account for selection bias and a counterfactual framework to measure the degree of influence. Thus, this study analyzes determinants of outsourcing and the impacts of outsourcing on agricultural productivity under the same framework. Findings The results revealed the following. (1) Farmer households with the below average productivity tended to outsource; conversely, farmer households with the above average productivity tended to cultivate the land by themselves. (2) Productivity increased by 25.61% for farmer households who choose to outsource. Moreover, if nonoutsourcing farmer households would choose to outsource, their productivity would increase by 10.86%. Originality/value This study furthers one's understanding of how outsourcing affects agricultural productivity among farmer households.

TI  - Smallholders? livelihoods in the presence of commercial farms in central Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - We study smallholder households livelihood profiles in central Kenya in an area characterized by the presence of many large commercial farms. We surveyed 375 smallholder households, compared them according to three categories (employed, contract farmers, households non-engaged with commercial farms), and constructed a livelihood index. The results show that contract farmers and households employed on farms are only a small fraction of all smallholders. Employed and non-employed households show little difference in overall livelihood profiles. Results suggest that employment on large commercial farms is mainly a coping strategy for younger households or in times of need. Contract farmers were found only in a specific location and had better access to irrigation water and higher livestock holdings. Comparison with earlier data shows the persistence of precarious livelihood levels and household strategies aiming at diversification of activities, with little evolution over the last 20 years despite the presence of commercial farms. Overall, there is little evidence that the proximity to the commercial farms offers a way out of poverty for nearby smallholder farmers.

TI  - Pitfalls of External Institutional Facilitation of Farmer Organizations: Insights from Farmer Companies in Sri Lanka
T2  - MILLENNIAL ASIA
AB  - Farmer companies (FCs) were a form of farmer-owned firms established in Sri Lanka during the mid-1990s. These have been facilitated by state institutions. Maximization of returns through commercial agriculture has been the main objective of FCs. However, no FCs were operating by the year 2010. This article explains that the institutional facilitation is a strong ingredient in the establishment of FCs in Sri Lanka. This article explains how the institutional and governance arrangements of FCs were influenced by the facilitating institutions during the institutional facilitation. It also suggests that institutional facilitation affected the performance of FCs. Six failed FCs were studied. Strategic facilitation was responsible for the performance and sustainability of FCs while operative facilitation provided the basis for direction and operations. Results indicate that poor performance and failure of FCs were due to institutional facilitation that has introduced weak institutional and governance arrangements. There was nonshareholder influence on the Boards of Directors; geographically restricted shareholding; democratic voting rights; and shareholder rights not linked to equity or patronage. Governance problems included voting by the raise of hand; managers not reporting to the Boards directly; shareholders did not elect all the directors. Institutional facilitation of FCs in Sri Lanka has been done by the state facilitating institutions. They have been excessively authoritative on their respective FCs. Therefore, changing the label from cooperatives to companies would not result in better performance. Some recommendations are that facilitating institutions empower FCs through capacity-building; participatory approach in facilitation; remove the geographical restriction in shareholding; install variable shareholding; build capacity of managerial staff; use secret ballots at voting, and practice proportional voting. Understanding the role of facilitating institutions and the dynamics of facilitation would be useful to promote farmer collectives in smallholder farmer dominant developing countries.

TI  - Contract Farming and Vulnerability to Poverty among Oil Palm Smallholders in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - This article addresses smallholder oil palm farming in Indonesia and the risk of falling into poverty by comparing contract and non-contract smallholders. We use an asset-based approach to define vulnerability and apply propensity score matching analysis to assess the impact of contract farming. Data were collected from a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2010 of 245 oil palm smallholder households, 126 of which were contract smallholders. The study finds that approximately 40 per cent of oil palm smallholders can be classified as stochastic-transient poor. We also show that while contract participation reduces the negative impact of oil palm price shocks, this is not the case for production shocks. The study concludes that despite positive income effects, contract smallholders also remain vulnerable to poverty.

TI  - Technology and Managerial Gaps in Contract Farming: The Case of Specialty Crop Production
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - We use a stochastic frontier approach corrected for self-selection to separate technology and managerial gaps between the treatment and control groups of smallholders in baby corn production in India. We also assess the impact of contract farming on output prices, profitability, and resource usage. We find that technical efficiency is consistently higher among contract farmers than among independent farmers and that significant technology and managerial gaps exist between contracted and independent growers. Ultimately, contract farming intervention benefits the livelihood of smallholders, increases efficiency, and reduces environmental degradation without compromising yield.

TI  - Effects of China's New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme on reducing medical impoverishment in rural Yanbian: An alternative approach
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Backgroud: This study aimed to measure the poverty head count ratio and poverty gap of rural Yanbian in order to examine whether China's New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme has alleviated its medical impoverishment and to compare the results of this alternative approach with those of a World Bank approach.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on a stratified random sample survey of 1,987 households and 6,135 individuals conducted in 2008 across eight counties in Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin province, China. A new approach was developed to define and identify medical impoverishment. The poverty head count ratio, relative poverty gap, and average poverty gap were used to measure medical impoverishment. Changes in medical impoverishment after the reimbursement under the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme were also examined.
   Results: The government-run New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme reduced the number of medically impoverished households by 24.6 %, as well as the relative and average gaps by 37.3 % and 38.9 %, respectively.
   Conclusions: China's New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme has certain positive but limited effects on alleviating medical impoverishment in rural Yanbian regardless of how medical impoverishment is defined and measured. More governmental and private-sector efforts should therefore be encouraged to further improve the system in terms of financing, operation, and reimbursement policy.

TI  - Climate-Smart Agriculture and Non-Agricultural Livelihood Transformation
T2  - CLIMATE
AB  - Agricultural researchers have developed a number of agricultural technologies and practices, known collectively as climate-smart agriculture (CSA), as part of climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. Development practitioners invest in scaling these to have a wider impact. We use the example of the Western Highlands in Guatemala to illustrate how a focus on the number of farmers adopting CSA can foster a tendency to homogenize farmers, instead of recognizing differentiation within farming populations. Poverty is endemic in the Western Highlands, and inequitable land distribution means that farmers have, on average, access to 0.06 ha per person. For many farmers, agriculture per se does not represent a pathway out of poverty, and they are increasingly reliant on non-agricultural income sources. Ineffective targeting of CSA, hence, ignores small-scale farming households' different capacities for livelihood transformation, which are linked to the opportunities and constraints afforded by different livelihood pathways, agricultural and non-agricultural. Climate-smart interventions will often require a broader and more radical agenda that includes supporting farm households' ability to build non-agricultural-based livelihoods. Climate risk management options that include livelihood transformation of both agricultural and non-agricultural livelihoods will require concerted cross-disciplinary research and development that encompasses a broader set of disciplines than has tended to be the case to date within the context of CSA.

TI  - What could promote farmers to replace chemical fertilizers with organic fertilizers?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - To lessen the negative environmental impact of chemical fertilizers, replacing chemical fertilizers with more organic fertilizers for famers is a good choice. However, most of the farmers would like to use chemical fertilizers instead of organic fertilizers in developing countries, mainly because they fear that they may lose income if they use organic fertilizers instead of chemical fertilizers. From this point, policy makers need to find strategies to incentivize farmers to use organic fertilizers instead of chemical fertilizers. Therefore, a randomly selected household survey on the use of chemical and organic fertilizers by apple growers in China was conducted from July 2016 to October 2016. Its aim is to find out what could promote farmers to replace chemical fertilizers with organic fertilizers partially or completely. We have analyzed farmers' choices involving prospect utility, risk, and environment based on Kahneman's prospect theory and Lewin's field theory. Twelve psychological and socio-economic variables were included in a tobit regression model to explain farmers' choice between organic fertilizers and chemical fertilizers. We find that membership in agriculture cooperatives, subsidies on organic fertilizers, and farm size play positive roles in influencing farmers' choice of organic fertilizers instead of chemical fertilizers. The results will be helpful to update extension policy of organic fertilizers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - How do farmland rental markets affect farmers' income? Evidence from a matched renting-in and renting-out household survey in Northeast China
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Promoting farmland transfer through the farmland rental market is an essential instrument to achieve the scale economy of agricultural production in China. However, past literature on the land reform in China pays more attention to the renting-in household or the renting-out household, respectively, less to both types of households together. Using a large-scale survey of farm households in China, we examine the determinants of participation in the farmland rental market and quantify the impact of the rental market on farmers' income. Findings show household off-farm income, family members' part-time employment, agricultural subsidies, and participation in agricultural cooperatives significantly affect farmers' participation in the farmland rental market. Participation in the farmland rental market significantly increases the income of renting-in households, while it decreases the income of renting-out households, which might result from the temporary lag effect of the land system reform.

TI  - Plantations, outgrowers and commercial farming in Africa: agricultural commercialisation and implications for agrarian change
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - Whether or not investments in African agriculture can generate quality employment at scale, avoid dispossessing local people of their land, promote diversified and sustainable livelihoods, and catalyse more vibrant local economies depends on what farming model is pursued. In this Forum, we build on recent scholarship by discussing the key findings of our recent studies in Ghana, Kenya and Zambia. We examined cases of three models of agricultural commercialisation, characterised by different sets of institutional arrangements that link land, labour and capital. The three models are: plantations or estates with on-farm processing; contract farming and outgrower schemes; and medium-scale commercial farming areas. Building on core debates in the critical agrarian studies literature, we identify commercial farming areas and contract farming as producing the most local economic linkages, and plantations/estates as producing more jobs, although these are of low quality and mostly casual. We point to the gender and generational dynamics emerging in the three models, which reflect the changing demand for family and wage labour. Models of agricultural commercialisation do not always deliver what is expected of them in part because local conditions play a critical role in the unfolding outcomes for land relations, labour regimes, livelihoods and local economies.

TI  - Gender and intergenerational challenges to Women's economic empowerment initiatives in Rwanda
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Women's Economic Empowerment (WEE) based approaches to social justice have attracted increasing attention among scholars and development-based organisations as a means of improving women's access to economic resources and increasing women's empowerment. A growing literature discusses the degree to which women's economic empowerment initiatives have been successful. Most of these studies have tended to rely on the use of economic proxies that capture the level of income earned by women. Based on qualitative information collected in five rural districts of Rwanda between July 2016 and January 2017, this paper explores how existing gender relations at the household level in rural Rwanda stimulate, promote/impede robust participation in WEE initiatives and explores the strategies used by rural women involved in WEE to challenge power relations at the household level. The research used a social justice and transformative approach, employing an interpretivist methodology and qualitative methods. Overall 126 women and 48 men participated in the research. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the information collected and three main themes were identified: cultural norms, expectations and women's participation; women's voice and agency from their engagement in economic activities; and the different generations of women who use different coping mechanisms and strategies to deal with adverse gender power relations. The research shows that if WEE initiatives are to reach their full potential, they must address cultural and structural norms that underpin gender inequality at the household and community levels. Thus WEE initiatives, as well as providing economic opportunities for women (and also men) must also address social justice issues that are harmful and affect women's participation in such initiatives and should support a transformative environment with respect to gender power relationships in rural households and communities.

TI  - Farmland Rental Participation, Agricultural Productivity, and Household Income: Evidence from Rural China
T2  - LAND
AB  - The rural land rental market is playing an increasingly important role in the agricultural transformation period for developing countries, including China, where rural farmland rental is highly context-specific with the implementation of the collective-owned rural land system; thus, in turn, the access to farmland rental markets for rural households has profoundly influenced their livelihood strategies and income earnings. This paper investigates the income impact differences caused by rural households' farmland rental participation activities and explores such impact mechanisms by further evaluating the income impacts caused by rental area and household agricultural productivity. Data from the Chinese national household survey were used for estimating the empirical models. Our results show that farmland renting has positively affected households' on-farm and total income, but there is no significant effect upon off-farm income. According to income differences across quantiles, we find households with high on-farm income are more sensitive about enlarging their farm size by renting farmland, and households with middle and upper-middle off-income may benefit more from renting out their farmland. Furthermore, the joint effects of renting area and household agricultural productivity on lessee households' farm income is significantly positive. For lessor households, our results indicate that renting out farmland did not improve their off-farm and total income as it may have a limited effect on farm household labor distribution. Our findings suggest that engaging in farmland rental activity can enhance farming productivity efficiency and poverty alleviation among rural households. Under the collective-owned rural land system, it is urgent and necessary to initiate and design incentive policies to encourage highly efficient large farms to expand the farm size and provide smallholders with equal opportunities to engage in farmland rental activities.

TI  - Solid waste collection by the private sector: Households' perspective - Findings from a study in Dar es Salaam city, Tanzania
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The issue of poor solid waste management (SWM) is a challenge throughout the world, in both developed and developing countries. People always generate solid waste through their daily activities. This solid waste needs to be properly managed in a way that minimises risk to the environment and human health, which means storage, collection and proper disposal. At the same time solid waste creates livelihoods for the urban poor in terms of employment and business. This paper looks into one aspect of SWM, namely collection service.
   The importance of SWM is now recognised at international, national and community level. The Agenda 21 declaration of the United Nations [UN. (1993). The global partnership for environment and development: A guide to agenda 21 (pp. 88-94). New York: United Nations] addresses the issue of environmentally sound management of solid waste, with emphasis on the extension of solid waste service coverage to all urban and rural areas worldwide.
   SWM is a service for which local governments are usually responsible. However, due to inadequate capacity in the public sector, in many developing countries the private sector has stepped in to fill the gap in service provision. Dar es Salaam (DSM), Tanzania, is one such developing country city in which the private sector has become involved in solid waste collection services. The sector comprises Non-Government Organisations (NGOs), Community-Based Organisations (CBOs), and local private companies [Kassim, S. M., & Ali, S. M. (2003). Private solid waste collection SERVICE, Dar es Salaam Tanzania. In Proceedings of the 29th WEDC international conference: Towards millenium development goals. Abuja Nigeria, Water and Engineering Centre WEDC]. The private sector in solid waste collection in DSM has been promoted by Sustainable DSM Programme (SDP) through Environmental Planning and Management (EPM) [UNCHS. (1994a). Sustainable Human Settlements Development: Implementing Agenda 21; UNCHS. (1994b). UNCHS (Habitat) Activities; New Envoy to UNCHS from the United Republic of Tanzania. Habitat News, 16, 1-3].
   Contracting out of solid waste collection services to the private sector has emerged to fill the gap in service delivery. In 1991 the city was generating 1400 tonnes of solid waste per day out of which only 5% was being collected. Currently daily solid waste generation is estimated at about 2500 tonnes and approximately 48% of the total waste generated is collected. At present, privatisation covers 44 out of 73 city wards, and 451 active registered private companies are involved [Chinamo, E. B. M. (2003). An overview of solid waste management and how solid waste collection benefits the poor in the city of Dar es Salaam. Solid waste collection that benefits the poor, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Collaborating Working Group on Solid Waste Management in Low and Middle-Income Countries (CWG)]. This paper presents the findings of a study that explored the households' perspective on solid waste collection services provided by the private sector. The study showed that the solid waste collection service by the private sector is greatly influenced by households' attitudes and behaviour. Their participation, demand for service, awareness, satisfaction level and views on cost recovery are important in the sector. The study concludes that the above factors would be superior if customers (households) were more involved in the planning and decision-making. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effectiveness of Rubber Plantation on Villagers' livelihood Improvement in the Northern Part of Laos
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
AB  - Rubber plantation processes had been involved with villagers' livelihood improvement as well as poverty reduction in Laos, the rubber plantation had been introduced among Lao farmers in 2000s. This study investigated to examine the effectiveness of rubber planting activities on the poverty criterion that Lao government had focused on the enhancement of local livelihood. 3 villages in Luangnamtha province were selected to investigate their outputs from the rubber plantation such as smallholder planting, contract farming and villagers who had become the employees in the rubber plantation field of investors. Comparison study on the sample households' livelihood in each period (before, during or after rubber plantation) for 3 selected villages, it can be concluded that smallholder planting is evaluated as a rubber planting model with positive impact on their livelihood improvement; and that cases of contract farming and employing of villagers in the rubber plantation field of investors are challenging to their livelihood improvement.

TI  - The visibility of women's work for poverty reduction: implications from non-crop agricultural income-generating programs in Bangladesh
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - This article explores mechanisms for making poor rural women's work visible by drawing on Amartya Sen's intra-family "cooperative conflict'' theory to explain the workings of two Bangladesh non-governmental organization's income-generating programs (rearing poultry and rearing silkworms). On the assumption that cooperation surpasses conflict in the intra-family relations when women's work is visible, the article identifies factors that influence intra-family conflict and cooperation. At entry, cooperation in a family depends on how successfully the family can make women's income-generating activities compatible with their existing household responsibilities and with continuation of the male breadwinner's income source. In women's continuing work, the level of cooperation depends greatly on the amount and frequency of women's income and the family's level of indebtedness. Families with a male breadwinner having a regular income source tended to offer a more cooperative environment to women's work than those with a breadwinner involved in casual labor. Women's work as a second regular income source can make their work more visible and contribute to their families' upward mobility.

TI  - Effect of private-led contract farming on rice growers' yield, cost, selling price and return: evidence from Vietnam's central Mekong Delta
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - This study attempts to examine the effects of contract farming on rice growers' productivity and profitability in terms of yield, cost, selling price and return in Vietnam's Mekong Delta using different propensity-score matching techniques. By using cross-sectional data collected from 166 rice farmers located in the central Delta, the findings reveal that participation in a contract scheme has a robust positive significant effect on rice farmers' output price and return but has no impact on yield and variable cost. The results of this study suggest that contract farming led by export enterprise enables rice farmers to raise their output price and profitability, which may magnify their household income.

TI  - Tree biodiversity in farmer cooperatives of a shade coffee landscape in western El Salvador
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Conservation of tropical biodiversity in agricultural landscapes has become more important as the area covered by natural ecosystems decreases. We analyzed the effects of local livelihoods, cooperative types, and selected biophysical variables (elevation, slope, percent shade, distance to the forest, coffee density, and coffee age) on tree biodiversity in shade coffee cooperatives of El Salvador.
   Tree inventories from 51 quadrats in coffee cooperatives included 2743 individuals from 46 families and 123 identified tree species. Species richness and tree diameters differed among some cooperatives, with greater richness associated with greater stein density; other biophysical variables had little impact on diversity. The amount of shade in the coffee plantations differed among cooperatives, particularly in the wet season. Of the tree species reported in a recent study of a neighboring forest and in the cooperatives (N = 227 species combined), 16% were present at both sites. The three coffee plantations shared 35% of total species reported from all cooperatives.
   Our research shows that the number of tree species found in a coffee plantation increases with the density of shade trees included in the system. In turn, agroecological management, as influenced by farmer livelihood strategies and cooperative types, directly affects shade canopy composition. Important factors to take into account are the types of farmer organizations present, the cost of maintaining species of conservation concern, and the potential benefits that conservation could bring to the livelihood strategies of farm households.

TI  - The profits of excludability and transferability in redistributive land reform in central Namibia
T2  - DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB  - Policies which redistribute property rights to land can improve the well-being of rural households and can have overall growth effects. In many cases, however, land reforms are driven mainly by politically justified objectives. Under such circumstances, little emphasis is placed on whether and, if so, how property rights can increase productivity. Following 18 years of land reform implementation in Namibia, we evaluated 65 beneficiaries in Namibia. We assess to which degree land rights affects their farm income. The study focuses on Namibia's two main commercial land reform instruments, namely the Farm Unit Resettlement Scheme and the Affirmative Action Loan Scheme. We find evidence that the majority of land reform projects are not profitable. Further, our study confirms the importance of the right to restrict land access compared with the right to transfer. The long-term leasehold contract seemingly provides sufficient incentives to make productive use of the land.

TI  - Adoption and diffusion of improved technologies and production practices in agriculture: Insights from a donor-led intervention in Nepal
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Adoptions of improved technologies and production practices are important drivers of agricultural development in low-income countries like Nepal. Adopting a broad class of such technologies and practices is often critical for meeting the multifaceted goals of efficiency, profitability, environmental sustainability, and climate resilience. This study aims to address the knowledge gaps that still exist concerning what determines the adoption of improved technologies and production practices, the factors affecting their diffusion, the impact of interventions on productivity and crops grown, and the variability of impact within a particular country context. In this paper we address these questions using data collected as part of the USAID-led Knowledge-Based Integrated Sustainable Agriculture in Nepal (KISAN) project. We adopted a multistage sampling technique and surveyed 988 beneficiary households and 997 non-beneficiary households in KISAN intervention districts and non-intervention districts. Our findings suggest that, in Nepal, adoption of improved technologies and practices is significantly increased by improved access to markets, private sector involvement in selling improved seeds and disseminating information, membership in progressive farmers groups and cooperative societies, participation in agricultural training and farm visits, provision of subsidies for seeds, and access to credit. We also found the probability of the adoption of improved practices to be affected by farmers' sources of information; for instance, the adoption of improved practices was increased when farmers obtained information from informal sources, cooperatives/farmers organizations, and public and private extension programs. The effects of KISAN projects vary significantly across the different crops grown, based on the evaluation models that address self-selection of both project participation and crop choices. These implications may also apply to other parts of the world facing similar challenges as Nepal, where limited market access, insufficient knowledge and resource capacity of farmers constrain their adoption of improved technologies and practices in agriculture.

TI  - A role-playing game as a tool to facilitate social learning and collective action towards Climate Smart Agriculture: Lessons learned from Apui, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - Addressing the global challenges of climate change (CC), food security and poverty alleviation requires enhancing the adaptive capacity and mitigation potential of land use systems. To this end, Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) aims to identify land use practices that sustainably increase productivity, enhance climate change (CC) adaptation and contribute to CC mitigation. A transition towards CSA requires technical, but also socio-institutional changes, for improved smallholder agricultural systems. Such changes may be triggered by stakeholder participation processes that stimulate social learning and collective action. This article evaluates whether a role-playing game (RPG) is an effective participatory tool to encourage social learning and collective action among local stakeholders towards adoption of CSA strategies. We designed and implemented an RPG with three groups of farmers in Apui (Southern Amazonas), evaluating the game's impact on social learning by interviewing each farmer before and after the RPG. Our findings show that the RPG induced not only technical learning, but also socio-institutional learning and engagement for collective action, though outcomes varied between different RPG sessions and among farmer participants.

Based on a repeated household survey, we measure the impact of the scheme on the income of participants and the economic mechanisms behind these effects. We find substantial benefits from the scheme, driven primarily by the establishment of credible incentives for farmers to adopt technologies which improve cocoa quality. There is also evidence of broader trends of market deepening and increased productivity, probably due to positive spillovers.

TI  - Livelihoods-conservation initiatives: Evidence of socio-economic impacts from organic honey production in Mwingi, Eastern Kenya
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Community-based initiatives with a double objective of improving rural livelihoods and conserving forest resources face the challenge of balancing the two objectives without creating trade-offs. Our study investigates the socio-economic performance of a community-based initiative that uses cooperative-driven organic certification of honey producers in Mwingi, Eastern Kenya, to improve livelihoods and acacia woodland management. Data were collected through a household survey of 303 beekeepers from 38 organic certified and 16 non-certified beekeeper groups. More data were collected using key informant interviews, informal conversations, participant observation, participatory rural appraisal, internal document reviews and secondary sources. The survey included questions regarding beekeepers' livelihood activities, organisation involvement, quantity of honey produced and sold, net honey income and welfare perceptions after certification (2015) and before certification (2008), retrospectively. The results showed minimal to no significant impacts of certification on households' incomes, honey quantity or sales prices, as the general development, though positive, followed that of the non-certified households. The lack of impacts stemmed from failure to monitor and technical backstopping of certified beekeepers, a poor cooperative management and mistrust among the members and Mwingi organic cooperative board. The board mainly bought honey from a non-certified middleman thereby undermining the Mwingi organic cooperative's values as well as their own potential niche market. On a positive note, the cooperative's honey market place, receiving customers from afar, has the potential to support the development of a niche organic market outlet. However, this requires reconnection of the cooperative to its members, trust rebuilding and transparent management of the cooperative. The study exemplifies a case of community-based livelihoods-conservation initiative which did not take local community capacity development and more general long-term project sustainability into consideration.

TI  - Access to Credit and Economic Well-Being of Rural Households: Evidence from Eastern India
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - We evaluate the impact of access to credit on rural households' per capita annual income using an endogenous switching regression approach, an increasingly popular method of tackling the selection bias issue in impact analyses. Using a large survey of rural households in eastern India, we find that access to credit is strongly associated with rural households' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Additionally, access to credit increases rural households' economic well-being; nonborrower rural households would benefit the most from access to credit. Access to credit affects recipients heterogeneously, implying that credit policies should be adaptable to different rural household groups.

TI  - Family Farms, Agricultural Productivity, and the Terrain of Food (In)security in Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Despite economic development and social improvements, millions of family farmers in Ethiopia are still struggling with food insecurity. Lack of technology adoption by family farmers is often considered as the root cause for low agricultural productivity and persistence of food insecurity. Based on a study of family farms in southwestern Ethiopia, we show the complex nexus between family farming, food insecurity, and agricultural productivity. We collected qualitative and quantitative data through 300 sample household interviews; expert interviews with elders and village chairmen, agricultural extension agents, farmers' cooperative heads, as well as experts in NGOs, research institutes, and state agencies; and on-farm observations with in-depth interviews and discussions with individual farmers. Our findings illustrate that everyday experiences, culture, knowledge, and priorities of farmers coupled with ecological and political factors play crucial roles-and need more consideration than the classic 'lack of technology' theorem.

TI  - Law and disorder: Local implementation of Mongolia's Land Law
T2  - DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
CP  - 8th Biennial Meeting of the International-Association-for-the-Study-of-Common-Property (IASCP)
AB  - With the dismantling of herding collectives in Mongolia in 1992, formal regulatory institutions for allocating pasture vanished, and weakened customary institutions were unable effectively to fill the void. Increasing poverty and wealth differentiation in the herding sector, a wave of urban-rural migration, and the lack of formal or strong informal regulation led to a downward spiral of unsustainable grazing practices. In 1994, Mongolia's parliament passed the Land Law, which authorized land possession contracts (leases) over pastoral resources such as campsites and pastures. Implementation of leasing provisions began in 1998. This article examines the implications of the Law's implementation at the local level, based on interviews with herders and officials in all levels of government, and a resurvey of herding households. Amongst many findings, the research shows that poorer herders were largely overlooked in the allocation of campsite leases; that the poor had become more mobile and the wealthy more sedentary; that there had been a sharp decline in trespassing following lease implementation, but that many herders and officials expected pasture leasing to lead to increased conflict over pastures. The Land Law provides broad regulatory latitude and flexibility to local authorities, but the Law's lack of clarity and poor understanding of its provisions by herders and local officials limit its utility. The existing legal framework and local attitudes stand in clear opposition to the implied goal of land registration and titling - an all-embracing land market and the supremacy of private property rights.

TI  - EFFECT OF ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT PROGRAM ON MARKET PARTICIPATION AND PROFIT EFFICIENCY OF INDIGENOUS VEGETABLE PRODUCTION IN SOUTH AFRICA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - African indigenous vegetables (AIVs) play a very significant role in food security of poor households. However, some AIVs are still underutilised in many African countries. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of farm support program on market participation and profitability of AIV production in South Africa. Data were collected from 86 AIV farmers from South Africa. Probit regression and Stochastic Frontier efficiency analyses were employed for data analyses. The results revealed that infrastructure support assisted farmers to improve participation in markets. In addition, engagement in growing spinach and amaranth vegetables, farm income, gender, cooperative membership and access to EDSP significantly increased the probability of participating in informal markets (p<0.05). Also, the determinants of indigenous vegetable farmers' profit were seed input, land area cultivated, interactions of fertilizer with fertilizer, seed with seed and fertiliser with seed. Profit efficiency was significantly influenced by farm distance, road conditions and access to EDSP. It was concluded that EDSP enhanced farmers' access to informal markets and profit efficiency.

TI  - Risk Preferences and Farmers' Livelihood Strategies: A Case Study from Eastern Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Low-return livelihood strategies are crucial drivers of food insecurity that may cause irreversible long-term damage to livelihoods. Experiments and survey results were used to examine the relative importance of risk preference and socio-economic characteristics for households' decision to engage in specific livelihood strategies in rural Ethiopia. Agricultural intensification and diversification are prevailing strategies, and farming households who participate in non-farm activities are better off than others. Education, information access, household income and cooperative membership correlate significantly with high participation rates in non-farm activities and on-farm diversification. Risk preference is an especially important barrier to households' participation in these strategies. Therefore, policy interventions that help to expand farmers' asset base and reduce entry barriers to these strategies are required to improve smallholders' welfare.

TI  - Why Does Sharecropping Survive? Agrarian Institutions and Contract Choice in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan
T2  - COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - A century ago, Alfred Marshall demonstrated the inefficiency associated with farmers receiving only a portion of their marginal product. Farmers will supply less labor than under arrangements in which they receive their marginal product; output will be sub-optimal. Explanations of sharecropping are based on market imperfections, e.g., high transactions costs or inability to insure against risk, suggesting that sharecropping should disappear with economic development. Nevertheless, sharecropping survives. In Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, sharecropping has no legal status but farm surveys provide evidence of its existence. Despite farmers' awareness of the Marshallian paradox, institutional uncertainty contributes to the persistent attractiveness of sharecropping.

TI  - Scale-appropriate mechanization impacts on productivity among smallholders: Evidence from rice systems in the mid-hills of Nepal
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Smallholder farmers in the mid-hills of Nepal are facing an acute labor shortage due to out-migration which, in general, has affected the capacity to achieve timely crop establishment, harvest, and inter-cultural operations. These effects are more visible in the case of labor-intensive crops such as rice and promoting higher levels of rural mechanization has emerged as the primary policy response option. Nevertheless, quantitative evidence for the ability of mechanization to offset the adverse effects of shortages increasing labor prices in these systems is largely absent. This study investigates the impacts associated with adoption of mini-tillers (5 to 9 horsepower) for land preparation on smallholder rice productivity in the mid-hills of Nepal. We use an endogenous switching regression that accounts for both observed and unobserved sources of heterogeneity between mini-tiller adopters and non-adopters. Findings demonstrate that rising on-farm rural wage rates and an emerging decline in draft animal availability are driving adoption of the mini-tiller. Among users, the mini-tiller increased rice productivity by 1,110 kg/ha (27%). Further, regression results suggest that mini-tiller non-adopters would be able to increase their rice productivity by 1,250 kg/ha (26%) if they adopt. Moreover, our analysis revealed that very small farms (<= 0.25 ha) that adopt mini-tillers are benefited the most in terms of gains in rice productivity. These findings support policies that favor the expansion of small-scale mechanization in the hill production ecologies of South Asia and highlight the need to foster the emergence of an associated service economy that will permit smallholders access to capital-intensive machinery such as the mini-tiller.

TI  - Community dominance in the use of pastoral territories: Impacts on livelihoods and implications for rangeland management in the Oriental region of Morocco
T2  - CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB  - Fifteen years after the creation of the pastoral cooperatives in the Oriental region of Morocco, collective management of the rangelands still represents a great challenge. in order to better understand how the pastoral zone is appropriated and exploited by the different groups in presence, a multi-level analysis has been undertaken on the area traditionally controlled by the Northern Beni Guil tribe. The rangelands were delimited and characterized following a participative approach, and then socio-economic surveys were conducted in an exhaustive way for all the segments of the tribe (fraction, douar, fiakhda) and in a representative way with 137 households. Main results of this study show that two types of dominance in rangeland use prevail in this zone: some fractions select the best rangelands and are able to exclude other groups from it, others respond by ploughing extensive areas as a way to secure access of the surrounding pastures. After detecting the main determinants of this dominance phenomenon by linking it to the community (douars) characteristics (demographic structure, governance, heterogeneity of assets, social capital...), their impact on the individual pastoral strategies is studied. Findings show that herders belonging to the fractions that are dominating the area by appropriating the best rangelands, are the less vulnerable since they have a lower probability to quit the breeding activity and to migrate. Therefore, to be equitable and effective, rangeland management in this zone has to be organized at tribe level, where pastoral cooperatives have to address these conflicting forces. The recently created union of cooperatives offers a formal and functional framework to initiate negotiations.

TI  - Attitudes of Kazakh Rural Households towards Joining and Creating Cooperatives
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - The government of Kazakhstan is currently developing strategies and policies to stimulate milk production at an industrial production level to increase milk processing capacity. We use and expand the reasoned action approach as a framework to study the factors underlying the rural household's motivation to participate in a governmental programme aimed at increasing rural cooperative production in Kazakhstan to increase milk production using primary data acquired from 181 randomly selected dairy households in the Akmola region of Kazakhstan. We account for the rural household's psychological factors and socio-demographic characteristics along with the household's risk attitudes, production structure, level of information about the government support programme and cooperatives, cultural aspects as well as the household's proximity to the main market. A bivariate probit model is used to jointly estimate the impact of these factors on the rural household's intention to join and create a cooperative. The results show that rural households which hold positive views towards cooperatives, have a relatively high production capacity, are aware/know of cooperatives, and do not have a dairy business as a source of household income are relatively keen to participate in collective actions. Perceived social norms and household risk attitudes also play a significant role in the rural household's intention to participate in collective actions. Finally, gender and nationality are found to be positively associated with joining and creating a cooperative, while higher educated rural households are found to be less motivated to participate in the programme. In order to stimulate milk production at an industrial production level through a policy that encourages collective action, we recommend a policy that (a) supports rural households which have the capacity to produce and are in need; (b) is attractive to rural households which consider dairy as a source of income; and (c) is well disseminated and well explained to the targeted rural households.

TI  - Can Agricultural Machinery Harvesting Services Reduce Cropland Abandonment? Evidence from Rural China
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Ending hunger, achieving food security, and promoting sustainable agriculture are the main targets of sustainable development goals. It is well known that cropland resources are the most essential factor in achieving sustainable development goals. However, China has been facing the problem of a continuous reduction in cropland resources. Reducing the abandonment of cropland has become an important way to curb the reduction in cropland resources. Can agricultural machinery harvesting services reduce cropland abandonment in rural China? To answer this scientific question, this study employs the Survey for Agriculture and Village Economy data from 8345 samples of 12 provinces in rural China. The extended regression models (i.e., the extended probit regression model and the extended interval regression model) are used to empirically analyze the relationship between agricultural machinery harvesting services accessed by farmers and cropland abandonment. The results are as follows. Agricultural machinery harvesting services accessed by farmers significantly reduced the probability of cropland abandonment and the proportion of the area of abandoned cropland in farmers' contracted cropland area decreased by 18.5% and 20.3%, respectively. Moreover, the heterogeneity analysis results showed that farmers' access to agricultural machinery harvesting services significantly reduced cropland abandonment in small-scale groups, without elderly households, with nonagricultural income groups, and in the eastern region. This study also provides some policy implications for policymakers to reduce cropland abandonment in rural China.

TI  - Vulnerability to Poverty in Chinese Households with Elderly Members: 2013-2018
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In Chinese households, there is a significant shift away from basing poverty alleviation on the relative poverty line as opposed to the absolute poverty line. Based on VER and the concept of poverty capacities, this study evaluated the impact of development capacities and indicators on the vulnerability to poverty of elderly households. The three most important findings are as follows: (1) This study employed the multidimensional vulnerability methodology to evaluate the effects of potential factors on the Chinese elderly household's vulnerability. Rather than analysing current poverty, this study focused on the estimation of future poverty, which is prospective. (2) Contrary to the expectations of empirical studies, the application of difference-in-difference and propensity score matching in this study revealed that the government's institutional pension reform decreases the vulnerability rate further. (3) Both development capacities and indicators are critical determinants of further poverty, and in order to effectively alleviate poverty, policymakers should strengthen capacities and grant rights to vulnerable households.

TI  - Costs of Lost opportunities: Applying Non-Market Valuation Techniques to Potential REDD plus Participants in Cameroon
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has been systematically advanced within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, implementing REDD+ in a populated landscape requires information on local costs and acceptability of changed practices. To supply such information, many studies have adopted approaches that explore the opportunity cost of maintaining land as forest rather than converting it to agricultural uses. These approaches typically assume that the costs to the smallholder are borne exclusively through the loss or gain of the production values associated with specific categories of land use. However, evaluating the value of land to smallholders in incomplete and messy institutional and economic contexts entails other considerations, such as varying portfolios of land holdings, tenure arrangements, restricted access to capital, and unreliable food markets. We suggest that contingent valuation (CV) methods may provide a more complete reflection of the viability of REDD+ in multiple-use landscapes than do opportunity cost approaches. The CV approach eliminates the need to assume a homogenous smallholder, and instead assumes heterogeneity around social, economic and institutional contexts. We apply this approach in a southern rural Cameroonian context, through the lens of a hypothetical REDD+ contract. Our findings suggest local costs of REDD+ contracts to be higher and much more variable than opportunity cost estimates.

TI  - The Labor Contract Law and the economic integration of rural migrants in urban China
T2  - ASIAN AND PACIFIC MIGRATION JOURNAL
AB  - This study examines the income determinants of rural migrants versus urban residents in the urban labor market of China during the 2008 Labor Contract Law era. We focus on the effects of employment contracts, enterprise ownership and social networks on income using data from the 2009 Rural-Urban Migration in China survey and applying ordinary least squares regression and propensity score matching analyses. The results showed that urban residents were more advantaged with guaranteed respectable job earnings, stable employment contracts and involvement in state-owned enterprises and public organizations compared to rural migrants. Rural migrants earned much less than their urban counterparts across ownership sectors. Although rural migrants benefited from urban networks, social exclusion impeded their accumulation of urban ties. Despite the Chinese Government's call in recent years to fully support the citizenization of rural migrants by revising the Labor Contract Law and reforming the household registration (hukou) system, the study showed that the integration of rural migrant workers in urban China has a long way to go.

TI  - Coping with local peoples' livelihood dependence on the transboundary Dinder-Alatish National Parks in Sudan and Ethiopia from the Sudanese Perspective
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The local peoples' dependence on Dinder National Park, Sudan, for their livelihoods and economic and conservation implications of the livelihood activities were analyzed. Our study attempted to answer major questions about the main livelihood strategies, their economic and conservation implications as well as the perceptions of local people and park administration on the use and management of the park and cooperation for TBPA management. A mixed research method was employed in this study in data collection Households' livelihood strategies are ranked according to their share in households' total income. Accordingly, 92% of respondents ranked agriculture as a primary source of livelihood in the rank 1 category, and 33% of respondents ranked livestock rearing as the primary source in the rank 2 category important source of livelihood. The ranking of second and third options varied across both households and villages. Households collect forest products to supplement their livelihoods and the collection of other environmental goods is irregular and difficult to quantify. Further human activities in the area are compiled from different publication and annual reports. Agricultural expansion into the park and livestock trespassing are the major threats to Dinder and neighboring Alatish National Park. A cooperative transboundary response will be helpful to cope with these challenges.

I employ panel data from Mozambique to investigate how membership in farmers' organizations impacts smallholders' welfare. Using difference-in-difference estimators that control for unobservable selection bias, I find a positive impact of membership on the marketed surplus (25%), the value of agricultural production (18%) and on total income (15%, and more than 20% for those whose main source of cash income is the agricultural sector).

TI  - Strengths and weaknesses of organized crop seed production by smallholder farmer: A five-country case study
T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - In many countries, smallholder farmers play a key role in food crop seed production. So far, the community roles, operational structures, seed production efficiency, aspects of sustainability, and the social and policy environments in which these groups operate have been poorly studied and described. The present study attempts to better understand these factors by drawing cases from twenty-five seed producer groups in five countries (Vietnam, Uganda, Zambia, Niger, and Guatemala) that deal with nine crops in total (rice, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, common bean, cowpea, soybean, groundnut, potato and sweet potato). Results of the study show all groups supply a significant share of seed offered in local markets. It appeared that all groups received major support for capacity development from a broad range of actors including local and national governments, public institutions, national seed companies and development organizations. Several groups operate under seasonal contracts with institutional seed buyers, whereas other groups sell most of their seed in local markets to fellow farmers. To support seed quality and render product branding meaningful, most groups have established subgroups for crop monitoring and seed inspection, and for gathering and using market intelligence. Some, but not all groups depend on formal seed certification. Two key challenges stand out across seed producer groups interviewed. First, most seed producer groups experience difficulties in accessing good-quality early generation seed (EGS) on time, like in the formal seed sector in many countries. Second, in most groups packaging and labelling of the seed produced and offered in local markets is suboptimal, hindering further professionalization. Moreover, groups invariably have a poor understanding of applicable seed policy and legislation. Our observations point at actions that external stakeholders could undertake to strengthen smallholder farmer seed production in recognition of their contribution to food and nutrition security.

TI  - Competition between biofuel feedstock and food production: Empirical evidence from sugarcane outgrower settings in Malawi
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB  - This paper analyses the implications of the expansion of biofuel feedstock production in Malawi on local food crop production. This represents a trade-off between two provisioning ecosystem services: biofuel feedstock (i.e. sugarcane) and food crops. Specifically, we assess household-level linkages between biofuel feedstock and food crop production among farmers involved in outgrower schemes around a large-scale plantation, sugar mill and ethanol distillery complex in Dwangwa, Central Malawi. Our analysis is based on a farm household survey that targeted sugarcane outgrowers (intervention group) and households not growing sugarcane (control group). We apply econometric and matching techniques to assess the impact of household participation in biofuel feedstock production on agricultural input expenditures for food crop production, land under food crops and investment in agricultural assets. In spite of limitations to establish causality, our results suggest that participation in sugarcane outgrower schemes is associated with larger amounts of land under staple food crops and higher purchases of farm inputs compared to the control group. The results further suggest that the expansion of biofuel feedstock production does not necessarily compromise household food production for those households involved in outgrowers schemes due to potentially positive intra-household linkages. We discuss under which circumstances this is possible, and whether and how other ecosystem services may be affected by sugarcane expansion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Livestock and Private Tree Holdings in Rural Ethiopia: The Effects of Collective Action Institutions, Tenure Security and Market Access
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - This article uses househld panel data spanning the period 2000-2007 to test hypotheses from the literature that secure land tenure, market access and collective action promote accumulation of private capital assets in rural highland Ethiopia. The three natural capital assets analysed in the article, livestock, eucalyptus trees and non-eucalyptus trees on households' farm plots, make up virtually 100 per cent of privately held disposable assets. Incomes and capital stocks are extremely low and constant and tree assets are at least as important as livestock. We find that collective action and secure land tenure have strong positive effects on accumulation of livestock and other trees, but not eucalyptus. We also find evidence that market access promotes eucalyptus holdings and that other types of wealth tend to be positively associated with private natural capital stocks.

TI  - Marketing efficiency and determinants of marketing channel choice by rice farmers in rural Tanzania: Evidence from Mbeya region, Tanzania
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - Rice production is an increasing source of income and food security for smallholder farmers in many parts of Tanzania. Improving market access for rice farmers is essential to raise rural incomes and reduce poverty. This paper aims to determine the most efficient rice marketing channel and analyse the factors affecting marketing channel choices by smallholder rice farmers. Marketing efficiency was tested using Acharya and Aggarwal's composite index method. A multinomial logit model was used to analyse the marketing channel choices. The results showed that the miller-wholesaler marketing channel is the most efficient. The results show that most farmers in rural areas still sell their rice to local collectors because of failure, fear or inability by farmers to venture out of the farm gate into the markets. The findings suggest that there is a need to improve rural infrastructure, market information systems, smallholder access to productive assets, prudent use of credit and strengthening collective action through well-organised farmer groups in the country.

TI  - "We are the city lungs": Payments for ecosystem services in the outskirts of Mexico City
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have emerged as an incentive-based policy instrument to manage and secure the flow of ecosystem services for human wellbeing. PES implementation has been mostly examined in rural areas but very few studies have paid attention to experiences in rural-urban landscapes that provide critical ecosystem services for densely populated areas. Informed by household surveys and focus groups, we analyze the implementation of Mexico's federal program of Payments for Watershed Services (PSAH in Spanish) in two communities located in the rural-urban fringe of Mexico City, paying attention to landowners' dependence on ecosystem services and both perceived benefits and costs of participating in the PSAH program. We demonstrate that landowners are generally aware of the critical services they provide to the city and beyond but there is a skewed level of knowledge regarding the program objectives and an uneven sharing of its benefits. The latter is influenced by collective organization and environmental history, with higher knowledge and more equitable benefit sharing present in the community with a more long-standing commitment to forest conservation. The PSAH incentive contributes to household income but it is clearly insufficient to motivate strong family and collective action towards halting land-use change beyond the PSAH targeted area. We thus argue that conservation policy in urban-rural fringes needs to be accompanied by effective land-use planning at regional level. This should involve multiple stakeholders and the re-conceptualization of Mexico City surrounding agricultural lands and forests as spaces to be governed for the provision of ecosystem services rather than as areas over which the city can expand.

TI  - Impact of contract farming on yield, costs and profitability in low-value crop: evidence from a low-income country
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - Lentils, a low-value and highly nutritious crop, are Nepal's largest pulse cash crop. However, the majority of the nation's smallholders produce lentils on very small plots of land. The large gap in lentil yields between Nepal and other lentil-producing countries underscores the importance of improving yields and income of smallholders. When it comes to the financial viability of small farms, particularly in developing countries, and globalisation, contract farming (CF) may prove useful in achieving efficiency and profitability in smallholder lentil farms in Nepal. This study employs the propensity score matching approach to examine the effects of the adoption of CF on yields, profitability and costs of smallholder lentil farms in Nepal. Findings from this study reveal that contrary to popular belief, CF adoption by lentil producers in Nepal has a positive and significant effect on per-hectare revenues, profits and yield and a negative impact on variable and transportation costs. The study finds that only very smallholder lentil farms (0.01-0.05 ha) benefit from CF.

TI  - LOCAL PERCEPTIONS-OF MIGRATION FROM NORTH-WEST GHANA
T2  - AFRICA
AB  - The Upper West Region in northern Ghana is a major source area of migrants who travel to southern Ghana seasonally or for longer periods. This has important implications for the lives and livelihoods of the migrants themselves and their relatives at home. Almost invariably the impact of out-migration on sending areas has been studied using 'Western' academic parameters. Little is known about how the people themselves value the profound changes that migration causes in their societies. In this article, findings are presented from interviews with 204 rural household heads who were asked to express their opinion about the consequences of seasonal, long-term and return migration, A quantitative approach to qualitative data was adopted to differentiate between collective perceptions and individual opinions. It was found that almost all respondents were positive about the consequences of seasonal labour migration. They applauded its contribution to food security and considered it one of the few ways of gaining access to money and goods. The respondents were much more ambivalent about the consequences of long-term migration and return migration. On the positive side, they emphasized that out-migration reduced the pressure on farmland, and that some migrants attain higher living standards, both for themselves and for their relatives at home. On the negative side, many long-term migrants are not able to improve their livelihoods or lose their interest in the home community. The lack of support of some migrants is greatly lamented, especially if they later return empty-handed and become a burden on their relatives at home. The methodology used in this study yielded a holistic view of the consequences of migration on the source area as seen through the eyes of the home community.

TI  - Multinationals vs. Cooperatives: The Income and Efficiency Effects of Supply Chain Governance in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - The impact of multinational firms on the domestic agricultural sector in developing countries is controversial, in particular in India. Relying on a unique set of household-level data from the state of Punjab, we study the biggest dairy company in the world (Nestle) in India and compare its vertical spillover effects on upstream suppliers to other market channels (informal sector and cooperatives). We find that farmers that supply informal channels are less efficient and earn lower profits per dairy animal than farmers supplying the cooperative and the multinational sector. Furthermore, we find that farmers using the multinational channel are more efficient than farmers in the cooperative channel, but equally profitable. Hence, we do not find that supplying the cooperative channel is more beneficial for local dairy farmers than supplying the multinational channel. Overall, however, dairy productivity and profitability levels are still dramatically low, with substantial scope for dairy development.

TI  - Disentangling the Effects of Fair Trade on the Quality of Malian Cotton
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The increasing importance of premium segments and private labels raise skepticism about the ability of Fair Trade to help smallholders compete in high value-added markets. Using panel data collected in Mali, this paper contributes to the debate by estimating the impact of Fairtrade certification on the quality of Malian cotton. Controlling for the nonrandom certification of producers, results show a significant impact on the quality of cotton produced by both certified and geographically close noncertified growers via spillover effects. The analysis suggests that contract farming enforced by third-parties and demonstration effects foster the adoption of innovative agricultural practices. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Household wealth and adoption of Integrated Striga Management (ISM) technologies in northern Nigeria
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Agricultural households in developing countries often are unable and unwilling to adopt new technologies due to the deterrents to adoption imposed by numerous socio-economic, institutional and ecological factors. However, economic theory predicts that relatively wealthy households have better ability to cope with production and price risks and as a result are more willing to adopt improved farm technology compared to poor households. Cross-sectional farm-level data collected from 643 households in Kano and Bauchi states in northern Nigeria in the 2013/2014 cropping season was used for the study. The study first categorized households into two wealth groups - poorly-endowed and well-endowed, to test whether differences in their wealth/stock of productive assets affects their Integrated Striga Management (ISM) technologies adoption and use intensity decisions. Separate double-hurdle models were estimated for each wealth groups. Empirical results show that factors explaining adoption decision and use intensity of ISM technologies differ across the two wealth groups. Hence, it is imperative that policies that are aimed at increasing the adoption and use intensity of ISM technologies and their subsequent impacts on households' food security and livelihood target different wealth groups.

TI  - Co-evolving dynamics in the social-ecological system of community forestry-prospects for ecosystem-based adaptation in the Middle Hills of Nepal
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - This paper analyses prospects for ecosystem-based adaptation, through examining diverse forest-people interactions in Nepal's community forestry as a social-ecological system (SES). We examine the linkage between social-ecological resilience and societal adaptation in the Middle Hills of Nepal and, based on this, discuss the prospects of this system for climate adaptation. In doing so, we also discuss the prospects of community forestry for ecosystem-based adaptation in the rural agrarian context, focussing on a few attributes of resilience: diversity, modularity, and flexibility. We find that community forestry provides multiple pathways for both reactive and anticipatory adaptation, often reinforcing community resilience. Our finding also shows that, while ecological processes in community forestry (CF) are being managed by local institutions with an explicit goal to enhance the overall resilience of the SES, the underlying social and political dynamics of CF tend to be neglected in adaptation policy and planning. This prevents local organizations from harnessing the benefits of ecological resilience to enhance their adaptive capacity. The contribution of ecological resilience to societal adaptation has been constrained by large scale social and political drivers, especially bureaucratic structures underpinning the governance of forest in Nepal. Based on these findings, we recommend that ecosystem-based adaptation is fully informed by, and takes account of, local power dynamics. For instance, aligning governance and decision-making with the needs of marginalized groups can increase the resilience and adaptive capacity of social-ecological systems.

TI  - The Alfredo Namitete Agroecology Credit System: A New Business Model That Supports Small-Scale Lending
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - A major obstruction in the development of sustainable agriculture is the weakness of the financial and banking sectors in supporting smallholder farming. While farmers need to invest in their farms, they struggle to find credit schemes adapted to their specific needs. This study explores the literature on a range of credit systems applied in different geographical and historical contexts to analyse the underlying drivers of their successes or otherwise. In light of this review, the study investigates a farmers' association, Alfredo Namitete (AN), in Mozambique, offering a range of agroecology credit modalities. It is then assessed as to whether a new business model initiated with seed funding could be self-managed by the association itself and lead to greater autonomy. The AN pilot tested three schemes between 2015 and 2019. Based on the findings, i.e., better production, increased revenue and greater self-determination, the study combines elements for a new business model for small-scale lending. It concludes that to be effective, a credit scheme needs to meet several conditions simultaneously: believe in the genuine will to repay, abolish the lender-borrower distance, ensure a role for women in decision making, add a savings mechanism, combine individual and collective investments and, finally, reserve funds for solidarity and climate issues.

TI  - Impacts of cooperative membership on rice productivity: Evidence from China
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Productivity growth is essential for food security and sustainable development of agriculture. Since rice is a major staple food in China, understanding factors affecting the performance of rice total factor productivity (TFP) is of great importance for China's future food security. Despite the growing importance of agricultural TFP, rigorous evidence-based studies on the impacts of cooperative membership on agricultural TFP, especially rice TFP, are scant, hindering the understanding about the potential contribution of agricultural cooperatives to TFP growth. This study examines the impacts of cooperative membership on rice productivity in China by using country-representative survey data from 2014 to 2018. An endogenous switching regression model is employed to account for selection bias. The empirical results show that cooperative membership has a positive and significant impact not only on rice TFP but also on TFP change, technical change and technical efficiency change. The results are robust to alternative choice of instrument variables. The effects of cooperatives on rice productivity are highly heterogeneous with regard to regions, farm scales and mechanization levels. Rice TFP gains through cooperatives are larger for producers in the eastern and central regions, while the effect on TFP growth is the highest in the western region. Regarding farm scales, cooperative membership has a positive and significant impact on rice TFP for small and medium farms but not for large farms. Moreover, cooperatives help improve rice productivity for provinces with low mechanization level of producers. This study further explores the underlying channels through which cooperative membership impacts rice productivity, and identifies that mechanical cultivation, high-quality inputs and technical training appear to be the main channels.

TI  - An assessment of farmers' satisfaction with land consolidation performance in China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Rural land consolidation has been a very important and efficient development tool all over the world for a century and is now an indispensable instrument for rural sustainable development in China. The Chinese central government has devoted large sums of money to rural consolidation projects each year in an effort to help protect cultivated land, to improve agricultural production, to enhance the socio-economic development of rural communities, and to help build rural landscapes. However, little attention has been paid to evaluating the performance of land consolidation projects from the view of community members, which is sorely needed. Household satisfaction with land consolidation projects is a key indicator of consolidation performance. Understanding the factors that influence household satisfaction is an effective way of dealing with problems in the interactions between land restructuring and human behaviors in rural areas and can help improve project performance. This paper examines the performance of land consolidation in terms of rural households' levels of satisfaction in rural China and analyses the most influential factors of satisfaction. Data were gathered via questionnaires and analyzed with a pro bit model. Results indicated three significant points. First, overall satisfaction rate was 76.5%, meaning that most rural households in the regions of Hangzhou, Changsha, and Guiyang were satisfied with land consolidation projects. Second, 11 factors significantly affected rural residents' satisfaction with consolidation. These factors included farmers' level of education, employment characteristics, family size, input level of agricultural production, agricultural produce transportation methods, level of agricultural mechanization, the characteristics of land transfer in the village and within their own families, the perceived importance of land consolidation, their level of social insurance support, and their participation in rural production cooperatives. Third, six of these factors had positive effects on performance; four had negative effects, and one (employment characteristics) demonstrated a significant influence. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Organic cultivation and farm entrepreneurship: a case of small tea growers in rural Assam, India
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - A few small tea growers in Assam, India, shifted to organic production of tea considering the ecological and economic benefits of organic cultivation. However, lack of sufficient training, technical know-how, inadequate experience, and market access posed serious threats to sustaining their business. Amidst the difficulties, some of these growers managed to overcome the initial problems of the production of organic tea. The present study uses a mixed method, multi-site, collective case study approach to understand the situation of these growers and to analyze it within the framework of farm entrepreneurship. The organic growers displayed entrepreneurial characteristics of being innovative, risk-taking, and opportunity seeking to overcome the initial difficulties. The findings suggest that the development of entrepreneurial skills among small growers would be crucial to promoting organic cultivation in the small tea growers sector.

TI  - Does Culture Affect Farmer Willingness to Transfer Rural Land? Evidence from Southern Fujian, China
T2  - LAND
AB  - This research explored the impact of culture on farmer willingness to transfer rural land. Data from 30 interviews and 537 valid survey questionnaires were collected in three villages in Zhangzhou, Fujian, China that are representative of typical Southern Fujian culture. First, a qualitative analysis was conducted based on interview data using NVivo11. Thereafter, a quantitative analysis using structural equation modeling was completed. The results of the field interviews indicated that cultural, economic, and individual factors were the three main influences on willingness of farmers to transfer land. Cultural factors were further classified into folk, religious, language, and family cultures. Religious belief culture had a significant negative impact on farmer willingness to transfer land, while language, family, and folk cultures had significant positive associations with farmer land transfer intentions. It was found that rural culture had a significant influence on farmer willingness to transfer land. The findings will help in developing a more comprehensive theoretical framework for research on this topic.

TI  - Assessment of Ngo SARA activities on sustainable agriculture and poverty reduction in Benty, Guinea
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - Agriculture is the principal activity of households and primary source of income, the high rate of poverty among farmers in Benty was about 63%. The type of agriculture practiced in Guinea being mainly subsistence farming, the cultivated areas are generally low. Although about 94% of farming households have hand tools (machetes, hoes, rakes and wheelbarrows), just one in ten has animal-drawn or mechanized tools. In these conditions, yields and sales capacity cannot be high. These results clearly indicate the need to prioritize the development of agriculture and rural areas in general, for rapid poverty reduction. This paper presents a socioeconomic analysis of Ngo SARA activities in Benty and prospects of improvement of farmer's living conditions. In order to better understand Ngo SARA' s activities on poverty reduction, a semi structured survey consisting of 20 farmers chosen from nine villages was carried out from April to June 2011. Three complementary ways were identified to improve farmer's living conditions: (1) support to supply and production; (2) support to Marketing and (3) support of peasant organizations.

TI  - Increased climate variability and sedentarization in Tanzania: Health and nutrition implications on pastoral communities of Mvomero and Handeni districts, Tanzania
T2  - GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - African pastoralists are undergoing significant changes in livelihood strategies, from predominantly mobile pastoralism to agro-pastoralism in which both livestock raising and cultivation of crops are practiced, to agropastoralism combined with wage labor and petty trade. These changes often result in fixed settlements or a process known as sedentarization. Previous research indicates that sedentarization and increased climate variability are prominent forces shaping livelihood opportunities and constraints in East Africa, but the effects of these co-occurring processes have yet to be investigated. This paper develops theory, using qualitative data collected in Morogoro and Tanga Regions of Tanzania, explaining the relationships between climate variability, pastoral sedentarization, livelihood outcomes, and resulting nutritional status. We observed that the co-occurring processes of increased climate variability and sedentarization among pastoralists in these regions have dramatic impacts on communities' economic prosperity, health status, and nutritional outcomes. Due to risks associated with climate and sedentarization, land tenure policies that allow continued practice of highly mobile livelihood strategies, namely, legal recognition of collective land rights, should be adopted.

TI  - Pastoralist Dilemmas: Where to Go and When to Move, or with Whom to Talk?
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
AB  - Pastoralists in Western Mongolia face a range of challenges during their annual grazing cycle due to the simultaneous but conflicting needs for secure allocation rules and a high degree of flexibility. In this paper, I analyze the seasonal arrangements and corresponding strategies that households adopt to deal with unpredictable environmental conditions and the demands of supplying livestock with sufficient forage throughout the year. In contrast to game theory simulations, I argue that dilemmas are: a) often not a question of cooperating or not, but form continua of more or less; and b) socially embedded as people operate in a multitude of relationships that influence their decision-making. Therefore, sharing information in a manner that prioritizes the requirements of individual households while not jeopardizing social reputation is crucially important. Rhetorical skills play an important role in this regard, but there are also situations when herders blatantly ignore state law or local institutional arrangements and risk confrontation to ensure the survival of livestock leading to a situation where free-riding may at times become the dominant strategy.

TI  - Poverty Alleviation and Interhousehold Transfers: Evidence from BRAC's Graduation Program in Bangladesh
T2  - WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Poor households often rely on transfers from their social networks for consumption smoothing, yet there is limited evidence on how antipoverty programs affect informal transfers. This paper exploits the randomized rollout of BRAC's ultra-poor graduation program in Bangladesh and panel data covering over 21,000 households over seven years to study the program's effects on interhousehold transfers. The program crowds out informal transfers received by the targeted households, but this is driven mainly by outside-village transfers. Treated ultra-poor households become more likely to both give and receive transfers to/from wealthier households within their village; and less likely to receive transfers from their employers. As a result, the reciprocity of their within-village transfers increases. The findings imply that, within rural communities, there is positive assortative matching by socio-economic status. A reduction in poverty enables households to engage more in reciprocal transfer arrangements and lowers the interlinkage of their labor with informal insurance.

TI  - Payments for ecosystem services and agricultural intensification: Evidence from a choice experiment on deforestation in Zambia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Agriculture is considered to be one of the major drivers of deforestation worldwide. In developing countries in particular this process is driven by small-scale agriculture. At the same time, many African governments aim to increase agricultural productivity. Empirical evidence suggests, however, that win-win relationships between agricultural intensification and forest conservation are the exception. Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) could be linked to agriculture support programmes to simultaneously achieve both goals. Due to potentially higher profits from intensified agriculture than from pure cash transfers, potential payment recipients may prefer in-kind over conventional cash payments. Nevertheless, little scientific evidence exists regarding the preferences of potential PES recipients for such instruments. We report from a discrete choice experiment in Zambia that elicited preferences of smallholder farmers for PES contracts. Our results suggest that potential PES recipients in Zambia value in-kind agricultural inputs more highly than cash payments (even when the monetary value of the inputs is lower than the cash payment), highlighting that PES could potentially succeed in conserving forests and intensifying smallholder agriculture. Respondents who intended to clear forest within the next three years were found to require higher payments, but could be motivated to enrol in appropriately designed PES. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Agricultural modernisation and rural livelihood strategies: the case of rice farming in Laos
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES-REVUE CANADIENNE D ETUDES DU DEVELOPPEMENT
AB  - This article examines how agricultural households in Laos have been affected by policies designed to transform agriculture from a subsistence-oriented sector into a dynamic and competitive one through intensification and commercialisation, and how the livelihood strategies of these households have in turn affected the modernisation goals established by the government. While overall rice output in Laos has grown significantly over the past few decades, market institutions related to the rice sector remain critically weak, and pervasive coordination failures are a disincentive to farmers to change their livelihood strategies. A more active government role, to improve market coordination, is needed for a successful modernisation of the sector.

TI  - Design of an agent-based model to examine population-environment interactions in Nang Rong District, Thailand
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - The design of an agent-based model (ABM) is described that integrates Social and Land Use Modules to examine population environment interactions in a former agricultural frontier in Northeastern Thailand. The ABM is used to assess household income and wealth derived from agricultural production of lowland, rain-fed paddy rice and upland field crops in Nang Rong District as well as remittances returned to the household from family migrants who are engaged in off-farm employment in urban destinations. The ABM is supported by a longitudinal social survey of nearly 10,000 households, a deep satellite image time-series of land use change trajectories, multi-thematic social and ecological data organized within a GIS, and a suite of software modules that integrate data derived from an agricultural cropping system model (DSSAT - Decision Support for Agrotechnology Transfer) and a land suitability model (MAXENT - Maximum Entropy), in addition to multi-dimensional demographic survey data of individuals and households.
   The primary modules of the ABM are the Initialization Module, Migration Module, Assets Module, Land Suitability Module, Crop Yield Module, Fertilizer Module, and the Land Use Change Decision Module. The architecture of the ABM is described relative to module function and connectivity through uni-directional or bi-directional links. In general, the Social Modules simulate changes in human population and social networks, as well as changes in population migration and household assets, whereas the Land Use Modules simulate changes in land use types, land suitability, and crop yields. We emphasize the description of the Land Use Modules the algorithms and interactions between the modules are described relative to the project goals of assessing household income and wealth relative to shifts in land use patterns, household demographics, population migration, social networks, and agricultural activities that collectively occur within a marginalized environment that is subjected to a suite of endogenous and exogenous dynamics.

TI  - Timing of first antenatal care visits and number of items of antenatal care contents received and associated factors in Ethiopia: multilevel mixed effects analysis
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB  - Background Receiving quality antenatal care (ANC) from skilled providers is essential to ensure the critical health circumstances of a pregnant woman and her child. Thus, this study attempted to assess which risk factors are significantly associated with the timing of antenatal care and the number of items of antenatal care content received from skilled providers in recent pregnancies among mothers in Ethiopia. Methods The data was extracted from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey 2016. A total of 6645 mothers were included in the analysis. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression analysis and multilevel mixed Negative binomial models were fitted to find the factors associated with the timing and items of the content of ANC services. The 95% Confidence Interval of Odds Ratio/Incidence Rate Ratio, excluding one, was reported as significant. Results About 20% of the mothers initiated ANC within the first trimester, and only 53% received at least four items of antenatal care content. Being rural residents (IRR = 0.82; 95%CI: 0.75-0.90), wanting no more children (IRR = 0.87; 95%CI: 0.79-0.96), and the husband being the sole decision maker of health care (IRR = 0.88; 95%CI: 0.81-0.96), were associated with reduced items of ANC content received. Further, birth order of six or more (IRR = 0.74; 95%CI: 0.56-0.96), rural residence (IRR = 0.0.41; 95%CI: 0.34-0.51), and wanting no more children (IRR = 0.61; 95%CI: 0.48-0.77) were associated with delayed antenatal care utilization. Conclusions Rural residences, the poorest household wealth status, no education level of mothers or partners, unexposed to mass media, unwanted pregnancy, mothers without decision-making power, and considerable distance to the nearest health facility have a significant impact on delaying the timing of ANC visits and reducing the number of items of ANC received in Ethiopia. Mothers should start an antenatal care visit early to ensure that a mother receives all of the necessary components of ANC treatment during her pregnancy.
   Plain language summary The third Sustainable Development Goals prioritizes maternal mortality reduction, intending to lower the worldwide maternal mortality rate to 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030. Regular antenatal care from a skilled provider reduces maternal mortality by 20%. The overall quality of ANC service is determined collectively by the timing of ANC, and the contents of ANC received. Though there is an increase in ANC visits and the quality of services received, only 74% of women who gave birth in 2019 received antenatal care from a skilled provider, ranging from 85% in the urban to 70% in the rural. Thus, the quality and content of care might remain poor while the coverage of ANC visits is high. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the levels and risk factors that affect the timing of ANC visits and contents to assess the quality of ANC services. This is the focus of the current study's research. In this study, nationally representative data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey was employed. Our study shows that rural residences, the poorest wealth quintile, no education level, unexposed to mass media, unwanted pregnancy, without decision-making power, and being far from the nearest health facility were found to be factors that hinder early initiation of ANC visits and reduce the number of items of ANC received. In conclusion, we ought to initiate an ANC visit early for a frequent antenatal care visit so that a mother will receive the necessary ANC components.

TI  - The ex-post impact of agricultural technology adoption on poverty: Evidence from north Shewa zone of Amhara region, Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE & ECONOMICS
AB  - This study investigates the impact of agricultural technology adoption on poverty reduction in north Shewa zone of Amhara region of Ethiopia in 2020. Using the selection model, this study finds that farm household's decision to adopt agricultural technologies are mainly influenced by sex of the household head, credit access, saving, extension visit, farm cooperatives and distance from market. Using an endogenous switching regression model, this study finds that adopters of agricultural technologies have higher food consumption expenditure per adult. Moreover, the significant difference in food consumption expenditure per adult equivalent between the actual and counterfactual scenario is very high. The result of the study confirmed that adoption of agricultural technology has a direct and significant impact on increasing household's consumption expenditure while also reducing household poverty. The findings of the study suggest that increasing the access and adoptions of agricultural technologies significantly improves the welfare of farm households.

TI  - Analyzing Households' Dependency on Non-timber Forest Products, Poverty Alleviation Potential, and Socioeconomic Drivers: Evidence from Metema and Quara Districts in the Dry Forests of Amhara Region, Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
AB  - Examining the household's dependence on non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and analyzing their determinants has significance for policy decisions. Therefore, this study examines the contribution of NTFPs to rural livelihoods, its potential in poverty alleviation, and socioeconomic drivers of households' collection of NTFPs. The study is based on primary data collected by using a structured questionnaire survey of 450 randomly selected households in Metema and Quara districts of Amhara region, Ethiopia along with key informant interviews, focus group discussion with residents, and from government offices. We adopted an income accounting model for apportioning components of total income for finding income from NTFPs and applied the Tobit regression model for our analysis and found that households are considerably dependent on NTFPs. Income from NTFPs accounts for 23.1% of the total household income. However, the level and pattern of reliance on these forest products vary across different socioeconomic groups. Income from NTFPs also helps 20% of the households to remain above the poverty line. Moreover, the study shows that age, household size, landholding, cooperative membership, per capita income, and access to extension service influence households' dependence on NTFPs. Thus, we suggest that any policy intervention in dry forest areas should be planned without destructing the forest ecosystem.

TI  - Estimation of profit efficiency of smallholder rice farmers in Uganda: A stochastic frontier approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH
AB  - Although rice has been regarded as a strategic crop for increasing incomes and food security in Uganda, the sub-sector is still characterized by yield gaps, post-harvest losses, poor coordination and improper marketing systems. These have resulted into low productivity and inefficiency. This study assessed the level of profit efficiency, its distribution by marketing models and the sources of inefficiency among smallholder rice farmers in northern Uganda. A single-step stochastic profit frontier approach was employed to predict profit efficiency and sources of inefficiency of 442 smallholder rice farmers using Maximum Likelihood Estimation techniques. Results revealed that seed, labor and transport costs were significantly high, while the mean profit efficiency level of rice farmers was 59%. Further, farmers who engaged in group marketing exhibited a higher profit efficiency level (65%) compared to those in contract marketing (56%) and individual marketing (59%) models. The major sources of inefficiency were use of hired labor and access to market information. However, inefficiency in rice production had a negative relationship with group marketing, marital status (married), gender of household head (male) and cultivation of both upland and lowland rice varieties. The study contends that tapping the unutilized profit efficiency potential in rice production and marketing will lead to improvement of smallholder farmers' performance in rice markets. The study therefore, recommends the need for establishing farmer-affordable local seed businesses, strengthening farmer groups, developing labor-saving technologies and providing market-tailored trainings to farmers. Moreover, the geographical-based differences in profit efficiencies requires location-specific interventions and benchmarking among the best performers.

TI  - Determinants of adopting improved bread wheat varieties in Arsi Highland, Oromia Region, Ethiopia: A Double-Hurdle Approach
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - The improvement of agricultural productivity using technology is an important avenue for increasing output and reducing poverty in sub-Saharan countries. However, the low adoption of high yield varieties has been identified as one of the main reasons for low productivity in sub-Saharan Africa. Consequently, the study examined the effect of demographic, socioeconomic and institutional factors affecting adoption and adoption-intensity of improved wheat varieties (IWVs), using data obtained from randomly selected farm households in the Arsi Highland of Ethiopia. We estimated a Double hurdle model to analyze the determinants of the intensity of IWVs adoption, as adoption and use intensity were two independent decisions influenced by different factors. The results also show that Double hurdle model is more appropriate than the Tobit model. Empirical estimates of the first hurdle reveal that wheat farming experience, distance to cooperatives, renting a tractor and combine harvester, Urea application, and net income from the wheat grain sale all significantly increased the likelihood of IWVs adoption. Estimates of the second hurdle revealed that the decision to use the optimal intensity of IWVs by smallholder farmers was influenced by seed availability, row planting, and distance to cooperative all significantly and positively. The intensity of adoption was also found to be negatively related to the proportion of farmland allotted for wheat production. Accordingly, policies and interventions that are informed about such factors are required to accelerate the adoption and adoption-intensity of IWVs in Ethiopia to realize a wheat Green Revolution and fight food insecurity in a sustainable manner.

TI  - Does cooperative membership impact the yield and efficiency of smallholder farmers? Evidence from potato farmers in Mongolia
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on potato production and technical efficiency. Design/methodology/approach A combination of propensity score matching technique and sample selection stochastic frontier framework that addresses potential selection bias due to observable and unobservable attributes is used to estimate the effect of participation between cooperative members and non-members. Using a stochastic meta-frontier approach, the technical efficiency of farmers was estimated and compared. Findings The empirical results show that the effect of participation in agricultural cooperatives is associated with increased yield and technical efficiency. A comparison of group-specific frontiers indicates that cooperative members perform better than non-members. Cooperative membership decisions is significantly associated with household and farm characteristics (e.g. education, participation in off-farm work, total farmland, distance to market and geographic location). Practical implications The findings of this study demonstrate that cooperative organisations can be an important tool to enhance the productivity and efficiency of smallholder farmers. Successful cooperative models together with training programs designed to enlighten farmers on the importance and tangible benefits of collective action should be used to enlarge participation in cooperative organisations. In addition, governments and development agencies should implement targeted investment and capacity building programs related to irrigation management, gender-sensitive awareness and development of the internal institutional mechanisms in cooperatives for the transfer of knowledge and mutual learning so that all members benefit from cooperatives. Originality/value Despite the pervasive evidence of the impact of cooperatives on productivity and technical efficiency in the Asian region, this study is probably the first attempt in the crop sector in Mongolia. It provides a rigorous empirical analysis of the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on potato production and technical efficiency through a counterfactual design.

TI  - Rural organizations and adaptation to climate change and variability in rural Kenya
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - Numerous studies have shown that collective action affects the type and efficiency of short- and long-term adaptation to climate change. This empirical study contributes to the body of the literature on collective action and adaptive capacity by demonstrating how organizations frame responses to climate variability and change in rural Kenya by promoting local rural institutions. By analyzing interviews, role-playing games, and household surveys, we ask how local rural organizations shape coping strategies to climate variability and how they may structure future adaptations to climate change. We also investigate what types of households participate in those organizations and how their participation may impact their vulnerability to climate change and variability. Our analysis shows that in places rendered especially vulnerable to climate change by arid climatic conditions, the disengagement of governmental services, and a limited access to income-generating activities, local rural organizations increase livelihood security. Those organizations reduce local vulnerabilities and enhance collective action. In contrast to common diversification and livelihood security strategies which rely on the access to urban or peri-urban structures, local rural institutions and organizations allow for rural and grassroots sustainable adaptation strategies. In that respect, they constitute a resilient and mostly untapped resource for visibly strengthening livelihood security and adaptive capacities in rural Kenya.

TI  - Property rights and grassland degradation: A study of the Xilingol Pasture, Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The semi-private property rights arrangement called the Household Production Responsibility System (HPRS) was started in the early 1980s in Xilingol pasture of Inner Mongolia (China), and stimulated the development of stockbreeding. The grassland has been degrading severely with increasing numbers of livestock. Based on a historical review of property rights regimes in Inner Mongolia and empirical surveys in Xilingol pasture during 2001-2003, this paper assesses the implementation of HPRS and its impacts on incomes of households as well as the environmental impact on the grassland. It was found that HPRS does not mitigate the "Tragedy of the Commons", instead it has exacerbated the situation. It was also found that co-management of grassland and livestock among a few households presents a sustainable use of grassland to develop livestock breeding. We conclude with the recommendation that small-scale collective property rights systems should be encouraged in Xilingol pasture of Inner Mongolia. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The hidden layer of indigenous land tenure: informal forest ownership and its implications for forest use and conservation in Panama's largest collective territory
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - A growing body of evidence points to the effectiveness of indigenous territories in reducing tropical deforestation, and global development goals call for increased legal recognition of indigenous land tenure. Yet indigenous land tenure systems are typically complex and multi-layered, and as such remain poorly understood in terms of the pathways through which embedded layers, rules, and norms influence the use and maintenance of forests. This paper illustrates one example of this multi-layered tenure in the case of indigenous communities in the Comarca Ngabe-Bugle, a semi-autonomous, shared territory in western Panama. While the comarca holds one formal collective title, research across five communities reveals an informal system of forest ownership that influences how forest resources are managed, and that has implications for longer-term forest conservation efforts. The findings show that indigenous households use and manage a wide range of plant species, but that access to forest resources is uneven, and pressure on existing forests continues to increase, even from within the comarca through population growth. Mature forest surrounding the communities is held in de facto ownership by individuals and families who restrict access to resources, and this informal tenure system appears to be slowing deforestation, at least over the short-term. Many of these forest stewards wish to protect at least part of the forest over the long-term, while several forest parcels are being kept in reserve for the next generation of farmers. This hidden form of forest tenure, embedded within the communally-held lands of the comarca, highlights an important research need for those looking to improve the effectiveness of forest conservation programs in reducing deforestation and improving indigenous livelihoods.

TI  - Social Capital and Sustainable Coffee Certifications in Costa Rica
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
AB  - Social capital has many applications in the adoption and management of voluntary certifications such as Fair trade, Rainforest Alliance, Utz, and CAFE Practices. We used a mixed-methods approach to assess social capital in five Costa Rican coffee cooperatives. We applied this information to its effects on the management of sustainable coffee certifications We found that the level of social capital affects the manner in which cooperatives manage certifications in terms of incentivizing certified members, distributing the profits from certification, and cooperating with outside organizations. Generalized trust was found to have an important link with voluntary participation in Rainforest Alliance certification when no financial incentive was provided. However, given the small differences among the cooperatives in micro-scale social capital, we conclude that certifications have not or have not yet made great impacts on the social capital on the micro-scale. This research presents important considerations for employing certifications and other sustainable development projects in different national contexts.

TI  - RISK FACTORS FOR MALARIA INFECTION AMONG RUBBER TAPPERS LIVING IN A MALARIA CONTROL PROGRAM AREA IN SOUTHERN THAILAND
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Rubber tappers work begins at midnight during the feeding time of Anopheles maculatus and An. minimus, two common malaria vectors in southern Thailand. We studied the association between rubber tapper behavior and malaria infections as reported to the Notified Disease Surveillance System during 2010 in Prachuab Khiri Khan Province, Thailand. In that province insecticide treated bednets are distributed free to the population and insecticide residual spraying is performed annually. A random sample of 394 rubber tapper households was interviewed from October 2010 to May 2011. Twenty-six households (6.6%) had at least one family member who contracted malaria during 2010. Poisson regression was used to identify potential characteristics associated with malaria. Multilevel Poisson regression was used to test for simultaneous effects of tapper behavior and household risk for malaria infection. The estimated incidence rate ratio (IRR) for contracting malaria among those owning a farming hut was 2.9 (95% CI 1.1-7.3, p<0.05) after controlling for other variables. Even in areas where control programs are in place, malaria infection among rubber tappers is common. Given the Thai Government's plan to expand the rubber plantation areas to other regions of the country without specific prevention for this at-risk population, the malaria burden in Thailand may increase.

TI  - HEALTH-SEEKING BEHAVIOR AND HOSPITAL CHOICE IN CHINA'S NEW COOPERATIVE MEDICAL SYSTEM
T2  - HEALTH ECONOMICS
AB  - Since the dissolution of the Rural Cooperative Medical System at the end of the commune period, illness has emerged as a leading cause of poverty in rural China. To address the poor state of health care, the Chinese government unveiled the New Cooperative Medical System in 2002. Because local governments have been given significant control over prop-ram design, fundamental characteristics of the program vary from one county to the next. These differences may influence the decision to seek health care as well as the choice of hospital conditional oil that initial decision. In this paper, we use a nested logit model to analyze household survey data from 25 Counties to analyze the determinants of such health-seeking behavior. We find that age, the share of household expenditures allocated to food consumption (a measure of relative income), and the presence of other sick people in the household negatively affect the decision to seek health care while disability has a positive influence. Further, conditional oil seeking treatment, the reimbursement scheme in place in each County and the average daily expenditure associated with hospitalization strongly influence hospital choice.

TI  - Domestic Violence and Women's Land Rights in Rural China: Findings from a National Survey in 2010
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - In recent decades, China undertook a series of agricultural land tenure reforms to increase the security of land use rights for rural households. While these reforms boosted agricultural production, they also increased landlessness among women due to patrilocal and patrilineal customs. Utilising data from China's Women Social Status Survey conducted in 2010, this paper examines the impact of women's land rights on the incidence of domestic violence in rural China. The results show that women who have lost claims to contract land or have no residential land face significantly higher risks of being physically or psychologically abused by their husbands.

TI  - Role of market participation on smallholder vegetable farmers' wellbeing: Evidence from matching approach in Eastern India
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - The study identifies determinants of vegetable farmers' market participation and evaluates their impact on households' welfare. In this study, we collected 175 cross-sectional household data and employed a probit regression model to identify the determinants of vegetable farmers' market participation. The study estimates the impact of market participation on households' income and per capita consumption using the propensity score matching approach (PSM). Subsequently, the study used the endogenous switch regression (ESR) model to control sample selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity. ESR also evaluates the robustness of PSM outcomes. Results from PSM and ESR approaches suggest that vegetable market participation positively and significantly impacts smallholders' income and consumption expenditure. The study rejects the null hypothesis that vegetable market participation does not significantly impact farmers' welfare. Results show that vegetable market participation increases the farmers' monthly income and annual per capita consumption expenditure on average by Indian rupee (INR) 8360 and INR 26,410, respectively. Findings also indicate that household size, distance to market, off-farm income, access to training, price information, vehicle ownership, and storage systems are critical determinants of vegetable farmers' market participation. Identified determinants may support policymakers in designing suitable agricultural marketing policies to reduce market entry barriers and motivate farmers for market participation.

TI  - Lending to Parents and Insuring Children: Is There a Role for Microcredit in Complementing Health Insurance in Rural China?
T2  - HEALTH ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper assesses the causal impact on child health of borrowing formal microcredit for Chinese rural households by exploiting a panel dataset (2000 and 2004) in a poor northwest province. Endogenous borrowing is controlled for in a dynamic regression-discontinuity design creating a quasi-experimental environment for causal inferences. There is causal relationship running from formal microcredit to improved child health in the short term, while past borrowing behaviour has no protracted impact on subsequent child health outcomes. Moreover, formal microcredit appears to be a complement to health insurance in improving child health through two mechanismsit enhances affordability for out-of-pocket health care expenditure and helps buffer consumption against adverse health shocks and financial risk incurred by current health insurance arrangements. Government efforts in expanding health insurance for rural households would be more likely to achieve its optimal goals of improving child health outcomes if combined with sufficient access to formal microcredit.

TI  - Determinants of smallholder farmers' participation in banana markets in Central Africa: the role of transaction costs
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - A bivariate probit model was employed to jointly and separately estimate banana market participation decisions of buying and selling households in Rwanda and Burundi using household survey data. Selectivity bias was corrected for estimating the transacted volumes using Heckman's procedure. The results showed that transaction cost-related factors such as geographical location of households, market information sources, and travel time to the nearest urban center influence market participation. Non-price-related factors such as security of land tenure, labor availability, off-farm income, gender of the household head, and years of farming experience had a significant influence on the transacted volumes. Output prices had a significant correlation with sales volume, indicating price incentives increased supply by sellers. Generally, the findings suggest that policies aimed at investments in rural road infrastructure, market information systems, collective marketing, and value addition of banana products may provide a potential avenue for mitigating transaction costs and enhancing market participation and production of marketed surplus by rural households.

TI  - Impacts of large-scale land acquisitions on smallholder agriculture and livelihoods in Tanzania
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Improving agricultural productivity is a foundational sustainability challenge in the 21st century. Large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) have important effects on both well-being and the environment in the Global South. Their impacts on agricultural productivity and subsequent effects on farm incomes, food-security and the distribution of these outcomes across households remain under-investigated. In particular, prior studies do not sufficiently attend to the mechanistic nature of changes in household agricultural practices that affect LSLA outcomes. To address these challenges, we use a novel household dataset and a quasi-experimental design to estimate household-level changes in agricultural productivity and other LSLA outcomes in Tanzania. We use causal mediation analysis to assess how four common mechanisms-contract farming, land loss, market access and technology adoption around LSLAs-influence agricultural productivity. We find that households near LSLAs exhibit 20.2% (95% CI: 3.1%-37.3%) higher agricultural productivity, primarily due to increased crop prices and farmer selection of high-value crops. Importantly, the direction and magnitude of effect sizes associated with the different mechanisms vary. The presence of contract farming explains 18.1% (95% CI: 0.56%, 47%) of the effect size in agricultural productivity, whereas land loss reduces agricultural productivity by 26.8% (95% CI: -71.3%, -4.0%). Market access and technology adoption explain little to no portion of the effect size on agricultural productivity. Despite higher agricultural productivity mediated by contract farming, we do not find increased household incomes or food security. Plausible explanations include limited market access, higher crop prices restricting food access and elite capture of contract farming concentrating income effects to a few households. Our results stand in contrast to assumptions that technological spillovers occur through LSLAs and are the principal drivers of LSLA-induced agricultural transformation. We find instead that access to contract farming and high-value crops lead to greater agricultural productivity, but also that benefits related to these mechanisms are unequally distributed.

TI  - "Los meses flacos': seasonal food insecurity in a Salvadoran organic coffee cooperative
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - Central American coffee farmers commonly refer to annual periods of food insecurity as los meses flacos' - the thin months - indicating a recurring season in which they are unable to meet household food needs. Although this is a common phenomenon, little empirical research has documented the seasonal food insecurity that many small-scale coffee farmers face. Household surveys and focus groups were conducted with 29 members of an organic coffee cooperative in western El Salvador to determine the causes of, and responses to, seasonal food insecurity. Ninety-seven percent of households faced food shortages during some period of the year. The two most common proximate causes of food shortages were lack of income-generating opportunities to buy food and running out of staple food crops. Families coped with seasonal food shortages by borrowing money and food, seeking work outside of the community, changing diet, and selling livestock. It is clear that small-scale coffee farmers seek to maintain a balance between coffee, which provides income, and food crops, which provide staple food. Livelihood and income diversification are important coping strategies that should be supported; however, we conclude that efforts to address food insecurity in coffee regions require deeper structural changes to support peasant farmers.

TI  - Certified Organic Agriculture as an Alternative Livelihood Strategy for Small-scale Farmers in China: A Case Study in Wanzai County, Jiangxi Province
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Organic agriculture can sustain rural development and ease poverty. However, whether it could be a viable pathway to improve the livelihoods of small-scale farmers in the context of urbanisation and demographic change has been less studied. To understand this, household surveys were conducted in 2007 and 2014 in Wanzai, Jiangxi Province China, where organic farming started in 2000. The results show that organic farming did contribute to higher farm incomes for small-scale farmers ( < 1 ha land) compared to those practicing conventional agriculture, regardless of whether the profitability is measured on a per land unit or per household basis. The annual farmers household net income increased from 2007 to 2014, however, the farm income of small-scale farmers only makes up a minor part of total household income and its percentage becomes less and less over time. For medium-scale organic farmers ( > 1 ha land), the proportion of income from farming was higher (56% in 2007 and 77% in 2014), leading to average farm incomes of USD16,108 in 2014. Among organic farmers, cooperatives members performed better economically than those not in cooperatives. Organic agriculture can ensure stable and sustainable alternative livelihoods, especially in a situation where available land offers opportunities for scaling up.

TI  - The influence of contracts on smallholder pepper (Piper nigrum L.) producers in Costa Rica under different market conditions
T2  - FRUITS
AB  - Introduction. Costa Rica's pepper production (Piper nigrum L.) is relatively low, but for the farmers involved it presents an interesting cash cropping activity. This paper aims to analyse whether contracts with processing firms offer an incentive for farmers to invest in pepper production and thereby increase their income. We analysed the characteristics of farmers with formal and informal contracts to see if this influences their way of producing pepper, their yields and income. The second goal of our work was to study whether market conditions (one or more buyers) influence contract uptake and pepper production. Materials and methods. A survey was conducted in 2000 among 63 farmers, 32 of whom had access to only one buyer and 31 of whom could sell to three potential purchasers. Characteristics of farmers, farms and pepper production were compared in terms of market conditions and forms of contract. A subsample of 24 farmers was revisited in 2008. Results. Overall, the effects of contracts in terms of improving access to inputs and increasing yield and productivity were limited. However, formal contracts were endorsed by income-constrained farmers, especially in the early phase of establishing themselves in the market. In subsequent phases, and under more competitive market conditions, producers seemed to prefer verbal commitments to formal contracts. In situations where a monopsony situation prevailed, there were lower yields. Conclusion. Contracts are important in the start-up phase, and competitive market conditions favour a process of moderate intensification which stimulates high returns at relatively low costs to the most established pepper producers.

TI  - Social connectedness in marginal rural China: The case of farmer innovation circles in Zhidan, north Shaanxi
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - The intrinsic dynamics and innovative potential of the rural poor in China can be illustrated by the phenomena of farmer innovation circles (FIC) in north Shaanxi. These are informal networks used by farmers to collaborate on technology learning and agricultural production. Though not limited to specific geographic locations, these circles are particularly important in the marginal areas of rural China where the complexity of the geographic environment, the diversity of farmer demands, and the inefficiency of formal agricultural extension networks impede the spread of new agricultural technologies. Social connectedness in the form of household communication networks, technology learning groups, and inter-village links aids people's collective capacity to work together. In the study of 50 villages in this remote region, it was found that households with more connections were more likely to adopt a range of new technologies (ploughs, varieties, inputs, orchards, afforestation, grazing land rehabilitation), and so had higher income. A detailed case study shows how collective action can lead to environmental improvements that further increase incomes. It is concluded that if there is to be sustainable development in the marginal areas of China, then there will clearly need to be closer communication and interaction between agricultural professionals and rural communities.

TI  - Smallholder farmers and forest landscape restoration in sub-Saharan Africa: Evidence from Central Malawi
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Malawi is a sub-Saharan African country at the forefront of the contemporary forest landscape restoration movement that places local smallholder farmers and resources users at the center of restoration actions. However, the manifestations of farmer-led bottom-up restoration efforts at individual and collective levels, and how they add up to landscape-scale restoration outcomes remain understudied. We analyze the nature of restoration efforts across interlocked forest and agricultural landscapes, estimate the extent of farmlands under restoration, and examine the contextual drivers and barriers of restoration. We use a mixed-methods approach combining a multivariate Tobit regression model and a Poisson model based on a 2019 household survey (N = 480 households), and qualitative insights from seven focus group discussions from Malawi's Dedza and Ntchisi Districts. The estimated mean total area of restored farmlands per household was 1.10 ( +/- 0.76) and 1.07 ( +/- 0.72) acres, representing, on average, about 54 % and 43 % of the total household landholdings in Dedza and Ntchisi, respectively. Results also indicate restoration diversification and intensification patterns whereby farmers generally combine two or more land-management practices based on complementarities in achieving specific livelihoods, food security, and ecological goals of restoration, and on compatibility regarding labor and other inputs demand. Land configuration mattered. Land plots that were spatially consolidated and tenure-secured were associated with higher restoration efforts. Also, women restoration efforts are limited by their inadequate access to productive inputs. Therefore, restoration policies should center on strategies that improve landownership security while minimizing fragmentation within landholdings and promote gender-responsive interventions. Drivers of collective resources restoration include strong local leadership; perceived tangible benefits for firewood, NTFPs, and timber resources; secure rights to collect firewood and free access to grazing areas; and perceived balanced among payoffs for energy needs, climate change adaptation, and ecological goals. These can inform restoration programs involving collective actions and their governance.

TI  - Role of Wild Food Environments for Cultural Identity, Food Security, and Dietary Quality in a Rural American State
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Wild foods are primary components of traditional and Indigenous food systems that are valued for food security while being vulnerable to global change. This case study examines practices, experiences, and perceptions associated with wild food environments through a household survey in the rural American state of Montana. Findings highlight that wild food environments contribute to cultural identity, sense of place, food security, and dietary quality of surveyed households while being vulnerable to loss of traditional ecological knowledge as well as climate and land-use change. Of the 182 informants, 80% hunt, 83% fish, and 68% forage wild botanicals. More than half of the informants agreed that wild food procurement is part of their cultural identity (66%). Collectively, informants procure more than 172 wild food species with the most prevalent being deer, waterfowl, elk, trout, bass, a range of berries, mushrooms, and botanicals used medicinally. Participants have a multidimensional value system where wild food procurement is valued for diets, recreation, family time, spirituality, and connection to the environment. The majority of participants agreed that the consumption of wild foods contributes to the nutritional quality (87%) and diversity (82%) of their diets while lowering food costs (59%). At least half of the informants reported observing changes in climate patterns over the past decade including increased temperature (50%) and more extreme and variable weather patterns (38%) that they perceive are impacting wild food environments including shifts in wild game, fish, and edible plant populations. Based on findings, we support that wild food environments and associated bio-cultural resources are a critical place to understand, conserve, and promote for nutrition. We thus advance the concept of "conservation for nutrition". Community engagement, education, and policy plans are called for to promote wild food environments toward supporting sustainable diets and planetary health.

TI  - Vulnerability and urban farming: Coping with price volatility in Ejisu-Juaben municipality, Ghana
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - Urban farmers remain vulnerable and trapped in poverty due to urbanisation and food crop and input price volatility. However, studies on the causes and effects as well as coping strategies to the phenomena remain inconclusive amidst diminishing urban farmlands, as the focus has been on smallholders in rural areas. This paper examines the attitudes of urban farmers on the strategies adopted to cope with input and crop price fluctuations in the Ejisu-Juaben Municipality, Ghana. Data obtained from 380 respondents showed that four major factors influence the volatility of input prices: oil prices, exchange rates, cocoa producer prices and inflation. Farmers, however, had no coping strategies to these due to the limited control over them. Two key factors were noted to influence crop price fluctuation: natural and demand and supply factors. Farmers coped with food crop price fluctuations by: adding value to crops; farming in flood plains; diversifying income sources and shifting to cocoa cultivation. A shift to cocoa production and farming in flood plains was however revealed to have adverse environmental and ecological implications. The paper recommends the promotion of contractual farming to safeguard farmers against income falls; and the formulation of an environmental strategy which emphasises drought-resistant crop varieties with shorter gestation periods as well as promoting sustainable land and water management practices.

TI  - Recovering from Financial Implications of Flood Impacts-The Role of Risk Transfer in the West African Context
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In many West African river basins, households regularly experience floods and the associated impacts. In the absence of widely accessible formal risk transfer mechanisms (e.g., insurance), households often have to cope with financial impacts. Only a few studies have explored the financial effects of floods on agriculture-dependent households in the region and the role formal and informal risk transfer plays in their mitigation. This study addresses this gap, explores flood impacts with financial implications for households, and researches the existing strategies to mitigate them. Moreover, it aims to better understand how different measures influence the recovery process. The study draws on primary data from a household survey (n = 744) in the Lower Mono River basin, combined with stakeholder workshops and semi-structured interviews, and applies a generalized linear model to the survey data. The results reveal four flood impact types with financial implications: agricultural, material, health, and trade. Moreover, a shortened recovery time is significantly associated with assistance from savings groups and cooperatives-groups originally not formed to help during floods. In light of the severe and frequent flood impacts, effective and publicly accepted adaptation measures are needed to enable favorable conditions for creating sustainable and accessible risk transfer mechanisms.

TI  - Potential of Dairy Industry with Special Reference to Generating Employment in India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF LABOUR ECONOMICS
AB  - Dairying has played a significant role in providing a livelihood to farmers in India. About 80 million rural Indian households are engaged in milk production with a very high proportion being landless, small and marginal farmers. The study aims to analyse the challenges faced by the dairy industry in generating employment and expanding their business. The paper has taken data from annual survey of industries over 20 years and a case study with a detailed interview of a cooperative society working in the dairy sector. The analysis is based on autoregressive distributed lag model. With the help of analysis, the study found that the dairy industry has the potential to generate employment. During the interaction for the case study, it was observed that firms in the dairy industry undertake the production of value-added products to yield profits which is limited due to low investments. However, the lack of advertisements of these products results in restrained sales and limits income of the farmers. Therefore, the study suggests that the private sector should be encouraged through product link incentive scheme and the government should intervene as a facilitator for their growth and expansion on international levels.

TI  - Farmers' Participation in Modern Supply Chains: The Case of Mandarin Profitability in Punjab-Pakistan
T2  - HORTICULTURAE
AB  - In developing countries, supply chains are rapidly transforming. However, smallholder farmers, in particular, have experienced mixed impacts in inclusion and exclusion from modern supply chains (MSCs). Therefore, by taking Pakistan's mandarin industry as a case, this study aims to analyze the farmers' efficiency and inclusiveness in modern supply chains and compare them across the farm size categories, i.e., small, medium, and large. For that purpose, cross-sectional data from 300 farmers were collected to test the posit objectives. The empirical investigation was made using the endogenous treatment effect model and the propensity score matching approach. Findings show that large farmers prefer to participate in MSCs, driven by contractors, processors or exporters. Conversely, the smallholders are more inclined to participate in the traditional supply chains (TSCs), driven by village vendors, local retailers/consumers, middlemen, and traditional fruit and vegetable markets. The results also revealed a positive connection between efficiency and farmers' inclusion in the MSC. Orchard size, education, off-farm income, and extension services positively impact profitability. In terms of an increase in farmers' profitability, the efficiency improvement can benefit the resource-poor smallholders who make up 74% of the total farmers in the sample. Therefore, these results are noteworthy for devising policy actions to facilitate smallholder inclusion in the modern agri-food supply chains to alleviate rural poverty and ensure farmers' wellbeing.

TI  - Econometric analysis of onion marketed supply in Northwest Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - Fruit and Vegetables are growing both rain fed and irrigation in Ethiopia and important for food security and income generation to a large proportion of the rural household. Enhancing onion farmers to reach markets and actively engage in the markets key challenges influencing onion production in Ethiopia. So the study aimed to analyze determinates of onion market supply. The study specifically aimed to address determinates that affecting onion production and market supply of rural households. A total of 275 households were selected using a multi-stage sampling technique followed by a probability proportional to sample size. The result indicated that in the study area 79.27% of onions producing households were male-headed whereas, the remaining 20.73% were female-headed household heads. On the other hand model results show that sex, age, household size, land size, motor pump, marketing contract, post-harvest value addition and market information positively and significantly affected the volume of onion supplied to the market. The findings imply that policymakers as well as policies designed at national level should consider on promoting the market contract, dissemination of improved onion varieties and input of production, intensification of land, expanding of post-harvest value addition activities and expanding the existence of irrigating equipments.

TI  - A Note: Reducing Cropland Abandonment in China - Do Agricultural Cooperatives Play a Role?
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Cropland abandonment occurring both nationally and globally threatens food security and environmental sustainability. We explore whether agricultural cooperatives help reduce cropland abandonment, using data collected from 5,593 households in 229 villages in China. By estimating a two-stage residual inclusion approach, we provide evidence that the existence of agricultural cooperatives in rural villages reduces the probability of cropland abandonment and the abandonment ratio. Further analysis shows that cooperative effects on cropland abandonment and the abandonment ratio are heterogeneous across geographic locations.

TI  - Women who do not migrate: Intersectionality, social relations, and participation in Western Nepal
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Migration impacts left-behind populations, disrupting established norms of social interaction, participa-tion, and inclusion. In western Nepal, labour migration is common among young men, with implications for household and community participation among those left behind, who are predominately women. In this study, we use mixed methods to examine how labour migration impacts the social inclusion of migrant households, especially, of left-behind women in community groups and activities. For our anal-ysis, we use quantitative survey data from over 3600 households in the Karnali and Mahakali River Basins of western Nepal and qualitative data from 16 focus group discussions and 37 in-depth interviews held in the same region. Our analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity in the experiences of women and house-holds left behind by migrants. Women's opportunities to participate in economic systems such as natural resource user committees and non-governmental organisation trainings are moderated by intersecting identities including gender, caste/ethnicity, kinship, age, and economic status. Young women from nuclear, low caste, and poor households with limited social ties suffer from disadvantaged positions and face restricted access to spaces of participation. Accordingly, left-behind women's opportunities to benefit from community resources remain dependent on their caste and kinship networks. These findings contribute to ongoing debates on the impacts of migration, and can help inform improved targeting of interventions to advance gender equity in rural Nepal.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors utilize official government statistics to discern trends of agricultural output at the national level, and the results of three extensive surveys conducted in 2007-2008 (N > 2,000) and one in 2003 (N = 4,000 respondents) by international organizations (United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, Asian Development Batik, the U.S. Agency for International Development, World Bank) to identify household-level changes. They also review the legislative framework for agrarian reform in the country; examine national-level trends in farm structure and organization, livestock production, farm productivity, and cropping patterns; and analyze shifts in size of land holdings and rural family incomes at the household level.

TI  - Determinants of household use of energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies in rural Ethiopia
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - The poor households living in low-income countries depend on traditional sources for basic energy service; which has a broader socio-economic and environmental adverse effect. To mitigate the problem policy measures were used to increase access to energy-efficient and renewable energy technology. However, there are few studies on demand-side particularly on the drivers of household joint technology adoption behavior. Against this backdrop, this paper examined the determinants of household behavior concerning the adoption decision of energy-efficient and renewable energy technology using cross-sectional data collected from 195 households in central Ethiopia. For identification, the generalized ordered probit model which is a more flexible discrete choice model was applied. The findings reveal that the richer the households, the more likely that they adopt both improved cookstoves and renewable energy technology because of the greater financial capacity to afford to pay the upfront cost of the technologies. Household size and assets such as landholding size and the number of cattle owned positively associated with the use of both technologies. Likewise, a high level of education attained by the head of the household likely reduces the likelihood of adoption of neither technology but increases the likelihood of adoption of renewable energy. Participation in off-farm income-earning activities likely increases the propensity to invest in renewable energy. Similarly, household membership in local cooperatives found to increase the propensity to invest in renewable energy technology. While access to credit found to increase the adoption of energy-efficient technology. The finding of this study implies that poverty reduction and education policies increase the propensity to invest in energy-efficient and renewable energy technology. Likewise, better access to credit, off-farm employment opportunities, and cooperatives are also important.

TI  - Assessing the adaptation strategies of farmers facing multiple stressors: Lessons from the Coffee and Global Changes project in Mesoamerica
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - This paper analyzes the challenges and opportunities entailed in the design, implementation and dissemination of an interdisciplinary project that evolved into a knowledge co-production effort. The project explored the livelihood strategies of coffee growers in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica facing multiple stressors of economic (market shocks and price volatility) and physical nature (climate variability and pest incidence). Our objective was to determine the factors that influence farmers' decisions and the implications of those decisions for the people and the landscapes of the region. To achieve this objective, we intended to engage farm communities and sector representatives in the research process, and to a large extent this intent was realized. Nevertheless, the project illustrates the difficulties in achieving knowledge "co-production" with stakeholders whose day-to-day existence focuses on issues largely outside the domain of the research program. We adopted decision-analysis tools to integrate our knowledge and hypotheses to find a common language and structure for our research design. In relation to regional and national policy makers and sector experts, we aimed to communicate the decision-environment of the smallholder producer to enhance awareness of the institutional opportunities and constraints in the adaptation process. For the farmers themselves, we aimed to serve as conduits and mirrors of their own knowledge, rather than serving as external authorities on issues that appeared to be of little interest to them. Through the course of the project, we experimented with diverse modes of stakeholder interaction and, through collaboration with local experts in communication strategies, identified a set of tools for successful dissemination of results. The credibility and direct ties of the participating research organizations and collaborating institutes with the local communities were often an asset, sometimes a complication, but always a critical factor in the process of stakeholder interaction. The messages constructed from the collective knowledge of local farmer's in distinct regions in four countries with different social and institutional histories represent crucial information for policy makers who are looking to support the adaptation processes of rural people facing changes of a global nature. However, communicating these messages in a usable and useful way to decision makers at various levels proved to be challenging. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Targeting vulnerable groups of health poverty alleviation in rural China- what is the role of the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme for the middle age and elderly population?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB  - Background In light of the health poverty alleviation policy, we explore whether the New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NRCMS) has effectively reduced the economic burden of medical expenses on rural middle-aged and elderly people and other impoverished vulnerable groups. The study aims to provide evidence that can be used to improve the medical insurance system. Methods Data were obtained from the 2015 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The method of calculating the catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and impoverishment by medical expense (IME) was adopted from the World Health Organization (WHO). The treatment effect model was used to identify the determinants of CHE for rural middle-aged and elderly people. Results The incidence of CHE in rural China for middle-aged and elderly people is 21.8%, and the IME is 8.0%. The households that had enrolled in the NRCMS suffered higher CHE (21.9%) and IME (8.0%), than those that had not enrolled (CHE: 20.6% and IME: 7.7%). The NRCMS did not provide sufficient economic protection from CHE for households with three or more chronic diseases, inpatients, or households with members aged over 65 years. Key risk factors for the CHE included education levels, households with inpatients, households with members aged over 65 years, and households with disabilities. Conclusions Although the NRCMS has reduced barriers to the usage of household health services by reducing people's out-of-pocket payments, it has not effectively reduced the risk of these households falling into poverty. Our research identifies the characteristics of vulnerable groups that the NRCMS does not provide enough support for, and which puts them at a greater risk of falling into poverty due to health impoverishment.

TI  - The Dynamics and Role of Gender in High-Value Avocado Farming in Kenya
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - We used two-wave panel data obtained from avocado growers in Murang'a County in Kenya to examine, through the perspective of gender, the dynamics of farmers' participation in avocado production and marketing organizations (PMOs), and test whether understanding group dynamics is important for analyzing contract farming. Using a multinomial logit (MNL) model, we identify the characteristics of men and women participating in PMOs categorized as early adopters, dis-adopters, late adopters, and non-adopters. We focus on dis-adopters and late adopters because these categories are most often ignored in the literature. Moreover, without considering the dynamics, we verify the influencing factors of PMOs by estimating a random-effects logit model that controls for unobserved heterogeneity across households. Furthermore, we estimate a sequential-choice model to test whether the process of selection into group membership affects the process of selection into contracting. Our results reveal heterogeneity with regard to household, farm, and resource characteristics across categories of farmers and between gender groups. Besides, the results reveal that group and contracting dynamics are related, and ignoring the former leads to biased estimates of the determinants of contracting dynamics. Policy efforts should focus on supporting women farmers to enhance their participation in PMOs, which ultimately affects contracting. Improving access to high-yielding avocado varieties and building capacity in orchard management would enhance women's decision-making including group participation, contracting, and marketing. Low-cost agricultural credit may also improve women's ownership of improved avocado trees and hence their participation in high-value markets.

TI  - Collective livestock research for sustainable disease management in Mali and Burkina Faso
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - An international multi-disciplinary team of scientists, led by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), tackled the problem of bovine trypanosomosis and the development of drug resistance in West Africa, inter alia, by the promotion of rational drug use (RDU) principles. These principles had been brought to farmers by practical training and by the provision of information leaflets. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of RDU training at smallholder level with respect to advances in farmers' knowledge and farm productivity before research outputs could be scaled up. Therefore, 508 cattle farmers attended a disease-specific knowledge test and provided information about farm production. Results show that farmers who participated in the training are more likely to identify signs and causes of the disease and to correctly administer drugs. Allocating scores to each question in the knowledge tests and scrutinizing the differences between trained and untrained farmers by matching procedures shows that participating farmers reach higher scores in all knowledge categories. Moreover, the acquisition of additional knowledge and the application of improved control strategies significantly increase farm performance. Additionally, an allocative effect was identified since trypanocide expenditures were saved by less expensive inputs.

TI  - Land Reform and Postcolonial Poverty in South Korea, 1950-1970
T2  - AGRICULTURAL HISTORY
AB  - This study aims to incorporate sociocultural and everyday life historical perspectives into the existing research on South Korean land reform. It seeks to position the excluded voices of farmers into the narrative of economic history and, by doing so, examines the possibility of comparative studies of land reform within the politics of Cold War developmentalism. South Korean land reform in 1950 transformed most tenant farmers into independent small farm owners. Tenant farmers attained their long-held desire to own land, but individual farm management left them in a precarious state. Disconnected from organized labor as well as from landlords' financial support, small-landed farmers began to suffer from the effects of low household income and a chronic lack of operating funds. To make matters worse, under the Syngman Rhee government, post-Korean War rehabilitation focused on fostering manufacturing while controlling inflation through intervention in the agricultural sector. In time, agrarian poverty led to a rural exodus, with the population of farm households dipping below 50 percent for the first time in 1969. In part because of these rapid shifts in population and production, the problems of a contracting agricultural sector were reduced to the problems of an expanding manufacturing sector. This context framed the South Korean government's decision to initiate the New Village Movement under the slogan of rural modernization.

TI  - Can social networks increase households' contribution to public-good provision in rural China? The case of small hydraulic facilities construction
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the roles social networks play in households' contribution to the provision of small hydraulic facilities (SHFs) in rural China.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts a sample-selection ordered probit model (Greene and Hensher, 2010) to estimate the impacts of overall social-network intensity, of the number of strong ties (relatives), and of the number of weak ties (friends), using data on 1,064 representative households collected from three provinces (Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Shandong).
   Findings - The numbers of strong ties and weak ties both have significant impacts on households' willingness to contribute to SHFs provision, but only the latter has a significant impact on their level of contribution. More specifically, a one standard deviation increase in the number of weak ties (i.e. friends) is associated with a 6.6 percent increase in households' propensity of contributing more than 550 yuan and a 8.2 percent decrease in their propensity of contributing less than 100 yuan.
   Originality/value - This paper is the first to examine the impacts of social networks on households' contribution to SHFs provision in rural China. Its finding is of great policy relevance-fostering and maintaining social networks (e.g. through rural cooperatives) can significantly increase households' contribution to public-good provision.

TI  - Coping with Drought by Adjusting Land Tenancy Contracts: A Model and Evidence from Rural Morocco
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We explore vulnerability to drought in Morocco by analyzing household coping responses to a severe drought. We find that nearly 25% of households increased or decreased their cultivated land via short-term land tenancy arrangements. We use this pattern to motivate a model in which drought shocks induce the reallocation within communities of usufruct rights to land. We show how different liquidity constraints can lead some households to invest in crop production as others divest. Empirical analysis finds some support for the model but also highlights how pre-existing tenancy arrangements strongly determine a household's reliance on land tenancy markets for coping.

TI  - Land arrangements for rural-urban migrant workers in China: Findings from Jiangsu Province
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - A massive amount of rural labor in China has migrated to urban areas and transferred to non-agricultural employment. This has resulted in issues regarding how to effectively arrange land that was contracted to them under the household contract responsibility system. Using survey data collected in Jiangsu Province and a multinomial logit model, this article discusses three methods of land arrangement utilized by rural-urban migrant workers (family farming, land transfer and abandonment) and examines the correlates of land arrangement methods. We find that there is a significantly positive relation between family size and the family farming option. The improvements in human capital, higher wages, greater job stability, and a longer commute time between migrants' cities of employment and their hometown are significantly correlated with land transfer or abandonment. These findings can elucidate China's land policy in the context of massive rural-urban migration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Soy, Cotton, and the Final Atlantic Forest Frontier
T2  - PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER
AB  - From 1945 to 2000, the extent of Paraguay's Atlantic Forest was reduced from 73,000 to 12,000 square kilometers. Deforestation rates were exceptionally high from the late 1960s through to the end of the century. During this period, dual agricultural frontiers pushed into the region from both east and west, resulting in a production landscape defined by two principal commodities: soybeans and cotton. This article considers the expansion and contraction of these industries and addresses their impacts on the region's forest cover. Findings suggest that the role of cotton and smallholder agriculture has been greatly diminished as a driver of land cover change in the region since 1990. High rates of forest loss were sustained, however, partly as a result of continued pressure for agricultural expansion for soy production.

TI  - Health impact and cost-effectiveness of a private sector bed net distribution: experimental evidence from Zambia
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Relatively few programmes have attempted to actively engage the private sector in national malaria control efforts. This paper evaluates the health impact of a large-scale distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) conducted in partnership with a Zambian agribusiness, and its cost-effectiveness from the perspective of the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP).
   Methods: The study was designed as a cluster-randomized controlled trial. A list of 81,597 cotton farmers was obtained from Dunavant, a contract farming company in Zambia's cotton sector, in December 2010. 39,963 (49%) were randomly selected to obtain one ITN each. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 438 farmers in the treatment and 458 farmers in the control group in June and July 2011. Treatment and control households were compared with respect to bed net ownership, bed net usage, self-reported fever, and self-reported confirmed malaria. Cost data was collected throughout the programme.
   Results: The distribution effectively reached target beneficiaries, with approximately 95% of households in the treatment group reporting that they had received an ITN through the programme. The average increase in the fraction of household members sleeping under an ITN the night prior to the interview was 14.6 percentage points (p-value <0.001). Treatment was associated with a 42 percent reduction in the odds of self-reported fever (p-value <0.001) and with a 49 percent reduction in the odds of self-reported malaria (p-value 0.002). This was accomplished at a cost of approximately five US$ per ITN to Zambia's NMCP.
   Conclusions: The results illustrate that existing private sector networks can efficiently control malaria in remote rural regions. The intra-household allocation of ITNs distributed through this channel was comparable to that of ITNs received from other sources, and the health impact remained substantial.

TI  - Compliance under control: Insights from an incentive-based conservation program in rural Bolivia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Conditionality is often considered a key feature of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) and other incentivebased conservation programs. Critical components of conditionality - monitoring and sanctions for noncompliance - have received relatively little attention. We identified five groups of potential drivers of compliance based on the concepts of material costs and benefits; social pressure; environmental values and beliefs; trust, fairness and reciprocity; and household characteristics. We analysed data on 1823 monitoring visits from an incentive-based watershed conservation program in rural Bolivia. Drivers informed by material costs and benefits were significantly associated with compliance. Specifically, three program design features were associated with higher likelihood of compliance: less restrictive contracts, larger areas under contract, and having been previously monitored for compliance. Other drivers, including sensitivity to social pressure, environmental values/ beliefs, trust, fairness and reciprocity, and household demographic and economic characteristics, were not consistently associated with compliance rates. These results suggest that conservation professionals and policy makers have a large amount of control over compliance in PES, and that clear communication with participants about program objectives and conditions and meaningful and repeated monitoring are key elements of successful and effective PES.

TI  - Certification and farmer organisation: Indonesian smallholder perceptions of benefits
T2  - BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - Certification and participation in farmer organisations are associated with economic and social benefits for farmers. However, knowledge about the differences in the perceived benefits of participation in different organisations and certification schemes is limited. In this paper, we distinguish between three types of farmer organisations in the Indonesian coffee sector: farmer groups, cooperatives, and KUBEs. We compare the benefits farmers perceive from participating in these forms of organisations, including the benefits for unorganised farmers and farmers in different certification schemes (Fair Trade, UTZ, the Rainforest Alliance, and 4C). We find that certified farmers perceive higher benefits than uncertified farmers, and that organised farmers perceive higher benefits than unorganised smallholders. Farmers who hold dual membership (in a farmer group and a KUBE or cooperative) perceive greater benefits than farmers who participate in farmer groups. Although farmers in different certification schemes significantly differ in the benefits they perceive, we could not identify clear patterns based on the schemes. We conclude that integration of the different organisational forms, as well as a more concentrated collaboration between the ministries underlying each organisational form, may improve the benefits perceived by farmers in the Indonesian coffee sector.

TI  - HEALTH-SEEKING BEHAVIOUR FOR CHILDHOOD MALARIA: HOUSEHOLD DYNAMICS IN RURAL SENEGAL
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOSOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Research on health care behaviour in sub-Saharan Africa usually considers the mother as the reference in the household when a child is sick. The study of health care management within the family is a key issue for understanding therapeutic rationales. This study was conducted in the region of Fatick in Senegal among 902 children with malaria-related fever. The data were taken from a retrospective quantitative survey conducted in all compounds of the DSS (Demographic Surveillance Site) of Niakhar. The results show that child care-taking is fundamentally a collective process: in 70-9% of out-of-home resorts, the treatment decision was collective. The health care process of 68-1% of morbid episodes involved several individuals. The involvement of the mother, the father and other relatives in the collective management of health care followed different logics. Each care-giver had a specific and complementary function depending on gender norms, inter-generational relations and characteristics of the family unit. Family management of illness aims at optimizing financial and human resources given the economic, logistical and social constraints on health care. Nevertheless, collective management also favoured home-based care, prevented good treatment compliance and delayed the resort to health facilities. These results suggest that health education campaigns should focus on an early involvement of fathers in health care-giving and also on the strengthening of the autonomy of mothers. Mothers' empowerment should give women more autonomy in their child's treatment choice. Lastly, there is a need to develop community health facilities and establish shared funding at the community level.

TI  - Characteristics and driving factors of rural livelihood transition in the east coastal region of China: A case study of suburban Shanghai
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Based on data from 412 households, this study used the sustainable livelihoods approach to analyse changes in livelihood strategies and the relationship between those changes and rural household attitudes in an eastern coastal region of China. Focussing on household off-farm employment decisions and land transfer decisions, we classified the households into six types based on their livelihood strategies, namely, off-farm employment-oriented, balanced, off-farm, idle, professional, and conventional. The survey results indicate that two capital factors, age and education, and two mediating factors, wage and crop prices, are important influences of off-farm employment decisions, whereas factors such as policies and subsidies, machinery, activities organized by local agricultural cooperatives, and land rent substantially influence land transfer decisions. By analysing the characteristics, trends and driving factors of livelihood transitions, i.e., changes in rural household livelihood strategies, from 1993 to 2013, we explored the mechanisms of livelihood transitions. The results indicate that the proportion of conventional households decreased and the proportion of off-farm employment-oriented households and off farm households increased. Agricultural production transformed from a system of scattered households (conventional and off-farm employment-oriented households) into broad-scale management households (professional and balanced households). These changes were the main characteristics of livelihood transitions under rapid industrialization combined with rapid urbanization in the Qingpu district. Rural livelihood transitions exhibited a stepped pattern, going through an initial stage, a self-organizing stage, and a government-led stage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Contract Farming in Mozambique: Implications for Gender Inequalities Within and Across Rural Households
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper analyses the implications of contract farming for gender inequalities in rural Mozambique. Contract farming is often considered one of the major tools of agribusiness development. It broadly includes those arrangements under which producers commit to providing cash crop to a buyer firm. This paper exploits a panel dataset (2002-2005) collected by the Mozambican Ministry of Agriculture among a nationally representative sample of rural households to explore contracts' implications for gender equality both across and within households. We look at both the participation of female-headed households in contracts and the impact of establishing a contract on a set of intra-household women empowerment indicators. Concerning the first, our results confirm a (small though significant) effect of selection out of contracts of households where a woman is the household's head. With regard to the second, we expect contrasting effects to be at work: on the one hand, increased income may relax budget constraints improving women's living conditions, and on the other, we may expect a shift in favour of men of the control over the household's assets. We find different results according to the indicator used; after controlling for selection bias, we find no effect on control over land but a negative effect on women's access to extension services.

TI  - Smallholder farmers' livelihood adaptation to climate variability and ecological changes in the savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Climate variability and ecological changes have consequently altered life and natural livelihood-sustaining systems leading to socio-cultural, economic and environmental challenges and vulnerabilities. The risk factors are very high and the impacts will raise the developmental impediments of safeguarding livelihood security and poverty eradication in Sub-Saharan Africa. Adaptation to climate and ecological variation, though recognized as pressing and necessary, operates in the context of numerous uncertainties and unknowns. Previous studies on climate adaptation tried to identify universal patterns of coping rather than differentiating between agro ecological zones, villages and types of households. This paper uses case studies from two rural communities in the Savanna agro ecological zone of Ghana to explore smallholder farmers' responses to climate and ecological variation effects on their livelihood activities that have emerged since the mid-1980s. Results suggest that smallholder farmers use various coping, on-farm and off-farm adaptation strategies to ameliorate the negative impacts of climate and ecological changes on their livelihood. Coping measures such as selling household assets, migration of the entire households and decreasing food consumption/changing diets can be damaging. On -farm adaptation strategies such as varying planting dates, use of drought tolerant crop varieties, soil conservation strategies are based on farmers indigenous knowledge passed down from generations. To ensure sustainability of local adaptation strategies, there is the need for exchange of knowledge between and among smallholder farmers and formal institutions through the recognition and empowerment of local residents and collective actions.

TI  - Does participation in contracts affect agricultural income? An empirical evidence from parboiled rice farmers in central Benin
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - The purpose of this article is to analyze the economic impact of participation of parboiled rice stakeholders in contract farming. Data were collected from a random sample of 200 farming households including 150 participants and 50 non-participants in the department of Collines in Benin. The results of econometric estimates show that the participation in contract is mainly determined by membership in a group of rice farmers, technical extension assistance and access to markets, good quality agricultural products, gender and formal education. Findings also reveal that contractualization has a positive effect on the income of the main primary players, in particular producers and processors of parboiled rice. It is therefore urgent that the agricultural contract remains a very important lever in rural areas in Benin. The contracts are likely to improve the economic efficiency of the adopters. Appropriate flexible contract measures are necessary and essential to boost growth in developing countries.

TI  - How indebted farmers perceive and address financial risk in environmentally degraded areas in Bangladesh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - In Bangladesh, the recent uncontrolled growth of industries near farmland and unplanned urbanization made the agricultural sector the most vulnerable and a massive threat to the food security of the country. Agricultural farms near to industrial zones face high production costs (poor air-water-soil quality, high labor cost) and low-profit margin (poor crop yield and crop loss due to frequent natural hazards). The government policy in this matter is not proper due to a lack of information. As a consequence, many of these farm owners adopt agricultural credit by themselves to manage the production cost. Basically, credit itself creates some other financial risks and the farmers needed to adopt different measures to handle these financial risks. In-depth research on this matter is important to improve the situation by providing relevant information that policymakers can plan an efficient policy framework. However, previous literature has overlooked this area of research. In this study, the researcher collected data on 400 rice farmers (debtors) from six different districts in greater Dhaka division (most degraded area in Bangladesh) and adopted probit model to analyze the influential factors affecting farmers' financial risk management adoption decision and to identify the correlations between these decisions. The empirical findings indicate that education, access to technologies, household income, savings, and distance from the industrial areas are the major factors that affect farmer's adoption choice and most of the farmers are risk-averse. Moreover, the adoption choice of one risk management tool may motivate farmers to adopt another.

TI  - Market-based grazing land transfers and customary institutions in the management of rangelands: Two case studies on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Beginning in the early 1990's, grazing lands once held in common were contracted to individual households in the rangeland regions of China. The resulting fragmentation of rangelands has led to ecological and social problems. As China seeks to address intractable poverty and rangeland degradation, attention has turned to rental, or transfer, of contracted grazing land as a market-based approach to re-aggregating grazing land into larger units that support economies of scale. However, given that many pastoral regions still maintain community customary institutions, what the relationship between market mechanisms and local customary institutions should be in rangeland management needs further analysis. This paper applies comparative case studies of two types of relationships between market mechanisms and customary institutions: (1) market mechanisms that replace customary institutions in the case of Axi village, and (2) market mechanisms that are embedded within customary institutions in Xiareer village. This allows contrast of the impacts of differing approaches on livelihoods, livestock production, and wealth differentiation among pastoral households. We found that there is a higher level of livestock mortality, lower livestock productivity, and higher livestock production cost in Axi Village compared to Xiareer Village. In addition, household asset levels are higher and there is less income differentiation in Xiareer Village. It is concluded that embedding market mechanisms within customary institutions has had notable benefits for the herders of Xiareer Village, because it is a better fit to the coupled pastoral social-ecological system. Based on these findings, we argue that in pastoral communities where the rangeland transfer system for contracted grazing land has not yet been implemented, it is critical to reconsider China's current policy approach to pay greater attention to the innovative management systems being developed in local regions. Instead of considering market-based approaches as oppositional to traditional institutions, options that derive from the interaction of market-based and customary institutions should be considered.

TI  - Do Agricultural Machinery Services Facilitate Land Transfer? Evidence from Rice Farmers in Sichuan Province, China
T2  - LAND
AB  - Agricultural machinery services play an increasingly important role in the land transfer market, especially in developing countries. Prior studies have explored the impact factors of machinery use on agricultural production and land transfer, respectively. However, little research has focused on the relationship between the adoption of agricultural machinery services and the land transfer of rice farmers. To bridge this gap, this study investigated the correlation between machinery services and land transfer, using unique survey data of 810 rice farmers collected from Sichuan province in China. Additionally, this study further explored the impact mechanism on land transfer of rural households with IV-Probit and IV-Tobit models. The empirical results show the following: (i) Agricultural machinery services have a significantly positive and robust effect on both the incidence and area of rice farmers' land transfer-in, while the impact degree is different. Specifically, with other conditions remaining unchanged, and with a 1% increase in the proportion of machinery services, the average probability of land transfer-in of rice farmers increased by 2.4%, and the area of land transfer-in increased by 13.4 mu, on average. (ii) For control variables, head education, agricultural certificates and whether the majority of land, are in a flat area have positive impacts on land transfer-in behavior. Yet, age and off-farm labor have a negative impact on land transfer-in area. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of agricultural machinery services in stimulating the development of rural land rental markets.

TI  - The effect of cooperative membership on agricultural technology adoption in Sichuan, China
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Farmer cooperatives may promote technology adoption in agricultural production, which, in turn, increases crop productivity and farmers' income. However, empirical evidence of how and to what extent cooperatives facilitate the technology adoption extensity, defined as the number of technologies adopted by a farmer from a wide range of agricultural technologies, remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we examine the impact of cooperative membership on the technology adoption extensity using cross-sectional data collected from 413 farm households in Sichuan province of China. We use propensity score matching combined with an instrumental variable approach to address the sample selection bias associated with voluntary cooperative membership choice. The statistical results suggest that cooperative membership has a positive effect on the technology adoption extensity when all 13 surveyed technologies are considered. However, the separate analyses on the adoption of production and post-harvest technologies reveal that cooperative membership has an insignificant impact on the number of adopted production technologies, but it significantly increases the number of post-harvest technologies adopted. These empirical findings are in line with the new institutional economics theories and our observations on the ground.

TI  - Smallholder farmer participation in local and regional food aid procurement Assessing the benefits and challenges in southwestern Uganda
T2  - INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW
AB  - Local and regional food aid procurement (LRP) - the purchase and distribution of food aid within and between developing countries - has recently become a common occurrence. In contrast to traditional methods of food aid provision, which are costly cross-border operations and often slow to respond during emergencies, LRP aims to combat food insecurity in a more effective, economical and contained manner. There is a limited amount of research concerning smallholder involvement in small-scale LRP initiatives. This article explores LRP's impact on smallholder farmers participating in a World Food Programme (WFP) procurement project in southwestern Uganda. It concludes that LRP has some benefits, including providing a ready market and empowering farmers, but WFP's procurement contract development, payment procedures and pricing mechanisms, and difficulties of ensuring participants' household food security, present challenges.

TI  - Can markets deliver the dual objectives of income generation and sustainability of natural resources in Uganda?
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - In this study, we set out to determine whether strategies used to link farmers to markets resulted in household level livelihood and NRM impacts measured by the participation in the market and the value of sales from the markets. Farmer to market linkages have improved livelihoods in developing countries due to policy, institutional and implementation strategies, however, equal emphasis has not been placed on investments in Natural Resource Management (NRM). Areas with high market access have often been cited as the highest in soil nutrient depletion, while input markets and labour required for land management are scarce at community level. We established a higher human capacity through formal education and technical skills built through extension and training services provided by the institutional affiliation which enabled support to specific enterprise production. We also observed increased commercialization through increased number of crops sold to the market through more than one marketing channel, including food and cash crops which compete with one another. Investment in NRM was low despite increased income.

TI  - The impact of metal silos on rice storage and storage losses in China
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Reducing food loss and waste has recently become an important aspect of ensuring China's national food security. Because of the importance of household grain storage, the government of China implemented the Scientific Grain Storage Project (SGSP) to encourage farmers to adopt advanced storage facilities (mainly metal silos for rice storage). Based on survey data of 1159 households in 21 provinces, we first analysed the factors that affect farmers' adoption of metal silos and then used Propensity Score Matching method to assess the impact of metal silos on household rice storage and storage losses. The number of years of schooling, religious beliefs of household decision makers, family size, annual net income, Cooperative membership, planting area, and awareness of grain saving practices were significantly correlated with household decisions on the adoption of metal silos. Metal silos significantly extended the duration of rice storage by households by 18 days, reduced rice storage losses by 43% from 1.6% to 0.7% of output, and protected rice from rodent damage during storage. Promoting the adoption of metal silos by farmers is important for ensuring China's food security. The adoption of metal silos can increase the supply of rice by 626,800 t per year; save 86,600 ha of land, 29,400 t of fertilizer, and 0.82 billion m(3) of water; reduce carbon emissions by 232,200 t, and meet the food consumption needs of 1.39 million people per year. The government should continue the SGSP scheme and encourage farmers to adopt advanced storage facilities.

TI  - Impact of Third-party Contract Enforcement in Agricultural Markets-A Field Experiment in Vietnam
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We study the effect of alleviating the information asymmetry regarding product quality that is widespread in contracts between agricultural producers and buyers in developing countries. Opportunistic buyers may underreport quality levels to farmers to reduce the price that they have to pay. In response, farmers may curb investment, thereby negatively affecting farm productivity. In an experiment, we entitle randomly selected smallholder dairy farmers in Vietnam, who are contracted by a large company, to independently verify milk testing results. Results indicate that treatment farmers use 12% more inputs, and they also increase their output significantly. Some wider research and policy implications are discussed.

TI  - Assessing the impact of non-governmental organization's extension programs on sustainable cocoa production and household income in Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB  - Globally, cocoa is famous for the production of chocolates and beverages. However, it also serves as a source of raw material for the manufacturing of high-quality cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Due to its high demand, cocoa is regarded as a major commodity for poverty alleviation in deprived cocoa farming communities. Government has therefore instigated relevant measures to address issues facing the sector by investing in extension programs. These programs act as information dissemination tools for teaching modern farming technologies and enhancing learning among farmers. This study highlighted the effects of the Cocoa Life Project (CLP) by Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE) International on farm productivity and income of 200 cocoa farmers in three districts of the Eastern Region, Ghana. Regression on covariates, Heckman's treatment effects model, and propensity scores were used to test the robustness of the estimates. A positive association between extension program participation, farm productivity, and household income was discovered. Specifically, after correcting for selection bias, the estimated results of the Heckman's model showed that the extension program significantly increased participating farmers' cocoa yield by 14.3%. The effects on total farm income showed a significant increase of 25.1 and 42.9%, respectively from regression on propensity scores and the Heckman's model. Across all three models, program participation led to an increase in total household income by 46.1, 31.7, and 69.3%, respectively. Other variables such as farming characteristics, institutional and demographic factors affected farmers' income, depending on the estimation method used. This study reiterated the supporting role played by extension programs in enhancing cocoa production and increasing household income in Ghana. Conclusively, government and development partners should invest in extension programs by providing enough logistics, training qualified agents, and creating a conducive atmosphere to support learning and technology adoption.

TI  - The effect of social capital in mitigating drought impacts and improving livability of Iranian rural households
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
AB  - The improvement of rural households' livability in drought conditions has always been an impor-tant challenge for all countries, especially developing countries, because consecutive droughts have reduced the resilience of these households and may even inflict irreparable damages to rural and agricultural communities if there are no systems in place for mitigating the risk of drought. This research explored the effects of social capital on the livability of rural families in Iran. The statistical population was composed of all rural-farmer families in Kerman province in the south-east of Iran. The study site was selected based on the severity of droughts. The results show that the studied households are not at an optimal level in livability indices and past droughts have se-verely reduced their livability level. If no comprehensive plan is adopted for drought manage-ment in the coming years, most villages in the southeast of Iran will be desolated. Furthermore, it is revealed that the dimension of social capital (social awareness, participation and collective ac-tion, membership in groups, social trust, and social participation) can account for 74.1% of the variance in rural households' livability in drought conditions. In general, the results can provide policymakers with new insights into how to supply conditions for the sustainability of rural fami-lies' livelihood in drought conditions.

TI  - Measuring financial protection for health in families with chronic conditions in Rural China
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: As the world's largest developing country, China has entered into the epidemiological phase characterized by high life expectancy and high morbidity and mortality from chronic diseases. Cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and malignant tumors have become the leading causes of death since the 1990s. Constant payments for maintaining the health status of a family member who has chronic diseases could exhaust household resources, undermining fiscal support for other necessities and eventually resulting in poverty. The purpose of this study is to probe to what degree health expenditure for chronic diseases can impoverish rural families and whether the New Cooperative Medical Scheme can effectively protect families with chronic patients against catastrophic health expenditures.
   Methods: We used data from the 4th National Health Services Survey conducted in July 2008 in China. The rural sample we included in the analysis comprised 39,054 households. We used both households suffering from medical impoverishment and households with catastrophic health expenditures to compare the financial protection for families having a chronic patient with different insurance coverage statuses. We used a logistic regression model to estimate the impact of different benefit packages on health financial protection for families having a chronic patient.
   Results: An additional 10.53% of the families with a chronic patient were impoverished because of healthcare expenditure, which is more than twice the proportion in families without a chronic patient. There is a higher catastrophic health expenditure incidence in the families with a chronic patient. The results of logistic regression show that simply adding extra benefits did not reduce the financial risks.
   Conclusions: There is a lack of effective financial protection for healthcare expenditures for families with a chronic patient in rural China, even though there is a high coverage rate with the New Cooperative Medical Schemes. Given the coming universal coverage by the New Cooperative Medical Scheme and the increasing central government funds in the risk pool, effective financial protection for families should be possible through systematic reform of both financing mechanisms and payment methods.

T2  - AIMS AGRICULTURE AND FOOD
AB  - This study focused on the coping strategies that smallholder livestock farmers used in the event of agricultural drought in South Africa. The result revealed that the majority of smallholder farmers sold their livestock, as a coping strategy. Results from the multinomial probit model revealed that the socio-economic and institutional variables influenced smallholder livestock farmers' choice of coping strategies. The study recommends that government and different stakeholders should enhance the resilience of smallholder livestock farmers by improving the efficiency of cooperatives, enhancing government involvement in drought and resilience activities, improve social-network and community involvement in policy implementation and planning, and strengthen communication to disseminate policies and relevant information.

TI  - Does agricultural cooperative membership influence off-farm work decisions of farm couples?
T2  - ANNALS OF PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - Membership in agricultural cooperatives may influence intra-household decisions regarding the division of household labor. However, the linkages between cooperative membership and labor allocation remain unexplored. To fill this gap, we examine the impact of cooperative membership on off-farm work decisions of couples engaged in farming, using data collected from 595 banana farmers in China. The recursive bivariate probit model and endogenous-treatment Poisson regression model are employed to address the self-selection bias inherent in cooperative membership. The results show that cooperative membership increases the probability of participating in off-farm work by 38% for husbands and 31% for wives. Having large households reduces the probability of husbands but increases that of wives working off-farm. Cooperative membership is also associated with more time spent on off-farm work and higher earnings for both husbands and wives. Our findings point to the potential of agricultural cooperatives to increase farm couples' off-farm employment, thus increasing household income and quality of life.

TI  - Financial Literacy, Borrowing Behavior and Rural Households' Income: Evidence from the Collective Forest Area, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Since the introduction of a series of collective forest tenure reforms in China, diverse forestland mortgage financial products have been available even in rural areas. It is difficult for rural households to make appropriate financial decisions in order to increase their income due to a lack of financial knowledge and relevant skills. It is important to analyze the relationship between financial literacy, borrowing behavior, and rural household income. Based on the learning-by-doing theory, the credit constraint theory, and the data obtained from the survey of 460 households in five rural countries of Liaoning Province, alternative econometric models were used to estimate the "Financial Literacy-Borrowing Behavior-Household Income" transmission channel. The findings reveal that the financial literacy levels are positively associated with household income and that there is an inverted U relationship between them which is low on both sides and high in the middle. In addition, the financial literacy has a significantly positive effect on the farmers' credit behavior, which in turn promotes their income growth. The results provide a new perspective on the study and a clear explanation of the role of financial literacy in improving the loan amountsavailable in China's rural areas. The paper concludes with recommendations for policymakers to prioritize financial education that will promote and support credit constraint reduction in collective forest areas.

TI  - Public-private partnership generates economic benefits to smallholder bean growers in Uganda
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - The quest to transform and hasten the role of smallholder farms in agricultural development and food security through farmer-firm linkages has dominated development interventions in low-income countries for several decades. This has mostly been pursued through single- or multi-contract schemes implemented in isolation. Several studies have analyzed the effects of these schemes on smallholder farms with mixed results. A new paradigm is to use Agricultural Public Private Partnership (Ag-PPP) to achieve wider and sustainable impacts. However, limited empirical evidence exists on the effects of Ag-PPP interventions and targeting the same farmer. We address this research gap by assessing the impact of an Ag-PPP on small-scale common bean producers in Uganda. We use a doubly robust difference-in-difference approach in a multi-treatment setting to estimate these impacts. The results show that the PPP created positive outcomes for farmers and stimulated increased production from targeted interventions. Evidence shows that the PPP and its interventions were associated with significant increases in productivity, sales volumes, and shares of output marketed. Receiving bundled interventions had greater effects than a single intervention and effects varied between men and women bean crop owners. Results suggest that providing bundled interventions through a PPP can increase productivity and alleviate market access constraints. The outcomes of this Ag-PPP could be modified for other contexts i.e., crops and localities, to inform food and development policy elsewhere.

TI  - The Impact of Land-Reform Legislation on Pasture Tenure in Gorno-Badakhshan: From Common Resource to Private Property?
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - In this paper, we look at the ways in which recent economic and legal changes affect pastoral management in the Gorno-Badakhshan region of Tajikistan. In Central Asia, livestock mobility is crucial for sustainable pasture management, but in Gorno-Badakhsan, average livestock ownership is extremely low. Households must therefore rely on collective herding practices if they are to exploit remote pastures and avoid overgrazing. Post-Soviet land legislation permits privatization with the aim of improving security of tenure for farmers; however, the same laws also apply to pastures. We consider whether the recent legislation is likely to promote or prevent livestock mobility, and assess the potential impact on collective herding. The effects of the legislation on the ground were investigated using 2007 field data from 2 sites, looking particularly at the impact of pasture privatization on collective users. We describe the extent to which pasture at these sites is under private, community, or state control, discuss the implications for sustainable management of this resource, and make recommendations for Tajik legislators.

TI  - The role of social networks in the inclusion of small-scale producers in agri-food developing clusters
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - This paper discusses how network theory and social capital can help explain different patterns of inclusion of small and medium sized producers in agri-food clusters. We make the argument that despite the centralized nature of practices, the manner in which inclusion takes place can vary significantly depending on structural features of local networks and governance factors, especially social capital and the role of lead organisations. Social network analysis allows us to investigate how different patterns of bonding, bridging and centrality of key actors in agricultural clusters can influence diffusion of knowledge. We frame this discussion through a typology that allows us to identify diverse scenarios of inclusion of small producers. This is then used to guide an empirical analysis of two agri-food clusters of small producers in Peru (mango) and Colombia (palm oil). Judicious use of mixed methods and the typology can prove useful to explain diverse patterns of inclusion which have important implications for small-scale agricultural producers.

TI  - Beyond the bean: Analyzing diversified farming, food security, dietary diversity, and gender in Nicaragua's smallholders coffee cooperatives
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Diversification is key for agroecological transformations, but little is known about how it relates to farmers' dietary diversity and food sovereignty. Our team and coffee cooperative staff conducted a participatory action research mixed methods study, including 171 surveys and 50 interviews. Over 70% of the farmers reported self-initiated diversification activities. Statistical analysis showed a significant positive correlation between crop diversity and dietary diversity, while controlling for farm size and income. To assess gender relations females responded to 41% of the surveys, and we separated focus groups by sex. Average male-owned farms were 1.8 ha larger than women-owned farms, yet we found no significant differences in household food security or dietary diversity. Additional disparities included male vs. female perceptions about who does additional diversification work and who decides about strategies. Although the co-op has a strong gender equity and technical assistance program, our analysis of extension training documents identified useful content and a smaller percent of female participants in diversification vs. gender sessions. Suggested strategic actions for co-op planning include supporting: (1) female land ownership, (2) diversification focused farmer-led experimentation, and (3) more training for men on gender, women on diversification, and all participants in feminist agroecology.

TI  - Informal associations, shocks, and household food consumption: panel data estimation from rural Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS
AB  - We use the three-waves panel data for households in rural Nigeria from the General Household Surveys (GHS), which is part of the World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study - Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA), to investigate how informal associations help households that are exposed to adverse shocks in smoothing their food consumption. We find that informal associations help to improve the percentage of food expenditure and dietary diversity of households who are members compared to those non-member households. Moreover, we investigate potential mechanisms through which these relationships hold, and we find that households are able to borrow from both the association and other individuals who may be members of similar networks. Our results are robust to different specifications.

TI  - The effect of NCMS on catastrophic health expenditure and impoverishment from tuberculosis care in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB  - Background: Health expenditure for tuberculosis (TB) care often pushes households into catastrophe and poverty. New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) aims to protect households from catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and impoverishment in rural China. This article assesses the effect of NCMS on relieving CHE and impoverishment from TB care in rural China.
   Methods: Three hundred fourty-seven TB cases are included in the analysis. We analyze the incidence and intensity of CHE and poverty, and assess the protective effect of NCMS by comparing the CHE and impoverishment before and after reimbursement.
   Results: After out-of-pocket (OOP) payment for TB care, 16.1 % of non-poor fall below poverty line. The NCMS reduces the incidence of CHE and impoverishment by 11.5 % and 7.3 %. After reimbursement, 46.7 % of the households still experience CHE and 35.4 % are below the poverty line. The NCMS relieves the mean gap, mean positive gap, poverty gap and normalized positive gap by 44.5 %, 51.0 %, US$115.8 and 31.6 % respectively.
   Conclusions: The NCMS has partial effect on protecting households from CHE and impoverishment from TB care. The limited protection could be enhanced by redesigning benefit coverage to improve the " height" of the NCMS and representing fee-for-service with alternative payment mechanisms.

TI  - Does Farmland Scale Management Promote Rural Collective Action? An Empirical Study of Canal Irrigation Systems in China
T2  - LAND
AB  - Farmland scale management represents an inevitable trend toward global modern agriculture. In the new development context, the key to solving the tough problem of the insufficient supply of rural public goods is to effectively improve the enthusiasm of farming households to participate in rural collective action in countries with a small arable area per capita, such as India, China and countries in Eastern Europe. This paper adopts the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework in the context of a land system with Chinese characteristics, and uses sample data of 3663 rural households in 17 provinces to study the impact of farmland scale and various relevant systems on farming households' participation in rural collective action. We found that the advantages of collective action, such as reduced production costs, enhanced risk resistance and improved production efficiency, can offset the disadvantages incurred by free-riding behavior, and the expansion of farmland scale can significantly facilitate rural collective action. Additionally, as the farmland scale expands, stable farmland tenure and reasonable farmland tenure transfer can help to optimize the allocation of arable land resources, increase investment, and reduce free-riding behavior, thus effectively stimulating farming households to actively participate in collective action. However, since socialized agricultural services lead to the separation of the suppliers and the users of rural public goods, the expansion of farmland scale shows a negative effect. Therefore, in the context of the continuous migration of the rural population to cities, a stable farmland tenure adjustment mechanism should be established, while the balance between farmland tenure transfer and socialized agricultural services, in pushing forward rural collective action, should be emphasized, so as to ensure the effective supply of rural public goods in propelling farmland scale management. Especially in promoting the development of socialized agricultural services, more attention should be paid to specifying the responsibilities and obligations of the main provider of commercialized services in the supply of rural public goods.

TI  - The effects of poverty reduction policy on health services utilization among the rural poor: a quasi-experimental study in central and western rural China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB  - Background China poverty reduction policy (PRP) addresses two important elements: the targeted poverty reduction (TPA) project since 2015 in line with social assistance policy as national policy; and reducing inequality in health services utilization by making provision of medical financial assistance (MFA). Therefore, this study aims to assess the effects of the PRP in health services utilization (both inpatient and outpatient services) among the central and western rural poor of China. Methods The study conducted household survey and applied propensity score matching (PSM) method to assess the effects of the PRP on health services utilization among the rural poor of Central and Western China. A sensitivity test was also performed on the PSM results to test their robustness. Results Key findings showed 17.6% of respondents were the beneficial of PRP. The average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) of the PRP on the inpatient visits within one year was found significantly positive (P = 0.026). Conclusion There has been relationship between PRP with medical financial assistance and reduction of inequality in health services utilization by the poorer, in particular to accessing the inpatient services from the county or township hospitals of China. Policy makers should pay attention for making provision of improving responsiveness of supply, when subsidizing on the demand side.

TI  - Conflicts between core purposes: Trade-offs associated with organizational shifts in Mexican community forest enterprises
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Community forest enterprises (CFEs) have been promoted globally in conservation and rural develop-ment initiatives. CFEs, which are considered social firms, commercialize various forest products and ser-vices to provide income, employment, public goods, and services. However, as with other social firms, CFEs may experience a tension between generating revenue and fulfilling their social mission. We explored this tension through a qualitative case study that examined the organizational choices of four CFEs in Oaxaca, Mexico, including the processes and practices they adopted that prioritized their social mission or more profit-oriented aims, and the way they navigated the tensions between their social and financial goals. Interviews revealed that the different organizational features of CFEs, including lead-ership structures, decision-making processes, enterprise locations, and benefit-distribution schemes, often elevated CFEs' social mission or more profit-oriented aims, typically at the cost of the other. With some exceptions, we found that the organizational processes and practices CFEs adopted to gener-ate more revenue often negatively impacted trust, transparency, and participation. We build on scholar-ship that has documented tensions between historical communal governance and enterprise management in Mexico by demonstrating how communities are modifying their organizational struc-tures in ways that blur the lines between traditional governance and enterprise management and, in some cases, in ways that mitigate trade-offs. Better understanding organization and associated trade-offs may allow CFEs-or other stakeholders interested in their proliferation and success-to make more transparent and deliberate decisions and avoid or adapt to undesirable outcomes and unanticipated con-sequences. As CFEs are promoted and replicated globally, our study is an important step in understanding the perverse outcomes and unintended feedbacks that arise from enterprise organization and illustrates the tension between social and financial performance in CFEs.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Income-related health inequality among rural residents in western China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - ObjectiveHealth equality has drawn much public attention in both developed and developing countries. China, the largest developing country, has implemented a new round of health system reform to improve health equality since 2009. This study aims to examine the magnitude and sources of income-related health inequality in western rural regions of China. MethodsData were obtained from the Survey of Rural Economic and Social Development in Western China conducted in 2014, in which 14,555 individuals from 5,299 households in 12 provinces were included. Health outcome variables of interest were self-rated health status, prevalence of chronic disease and four-week illness. Concentration index was calculated to assess magnitude of income-related health inequality, and nonlinear decomposition analysis was performed to identify the sources of health inequality. ResultsThe Concentration indexes for poor self-rated health status, prevalence of chronic disease and four-week illness were -0.0898 (P<0.001),-0.0860 (P<0.001) and -0.1284 (P<0.001), respectively. Income and education were two main sources of health inequality, accounting for about 25-50% and 15% contribution to the inequality. Ethnicity made <10% contribution to income-related health inequality, and enrollment in New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme contributed to ConclusionThis study found slight income-related health inequality among rural residents in western China, implying that although China has made substantial progress in economic development and poverty alleviation, health inequality in western rural region should still be concerned by the government. To achieve health equality further, the Chinese government should not only strengthen its reimbursement mechanism of the current health insurance scheme to improve affordability of primary healthcare for residents in western rural regions, but also implement health poverty alleviation policies targeting socioeconomically vulnerable population and ethnic minorities in future.

TI  - Impact of metal silos on households' maize storage, storage losses and food security: An application of a propensity score matching
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Maize is the most important food staple in Eastern and Southern Africa, with a highly seasonal production but relatively constant consumption over the year. Farmers have to store maize to bridge seasons, for food security and to protect against price fluctuations. However, the traditional storage methods do not protect grain well, resulting in large postharvest losses. Hermetically sealed metal silos kill storage pests by oxygen deprivation without pesticides. Popular in Central America, they are now being promoted in Africa, but their impact here has not yet been studied. This study used propensity score matching to evaluate the impact of metal silos on duration of maize storage, loss abatement, cost of storage, and household food security. Metal silo adopters (N = 116) were matched with non-adopting farmers from a representative sample of 1340 households covering the major maize-growing zones in Kenya. The major effect of the metal silos was an almost complete elimination of losses due to insect pests, saving farmers an average of 150-200 kg of grain, worth KSh9750 (US$130). Metal silo adopters also spent about KSh340 less on storage insecticides. Adopters were able to store their maize for 1.8-2.4 months longer, and to sell their surplus after five months at good prices, instead of having to sell right after the harvest. The period of inadequate food provision among adopters was reduced by more than one month. We conclude that metal silos are effective in reducing grain losses due to maize-storage insects, and that they have a large impact on the welfare and food security of farm households. The initial cost of metal silos is high (KSh20,000/1.8 ton) and therefore policies to increase access to credit, to reduce the cost of sheet metal, and to promote collective action can improve their uptake by smallholder farmers.

TI  - Livelihood Improvement through Agroforestry Compared to Conventional Farming System: Evidence from Northern Irrigated Plain, Pakistan
T2  - LAND
AB  - The concept of sustainable livelihood garnered a prominent status in humanitarian and international development organizations that aim to calculate and build a livelihood for agroforestry farmers. However, it is difficult to measure and analyze as well as visualize the data of livelihood improvement from agroforestry (AF). This paper comparatively assessed 400 smallholder farmers' livelihood through AF and conventional farming (CF) systems in the Northern Irrigated Plain of Pakistan. The findings showed that AF has a mixed impact on farmers' livelihood capital, including human, physical, natural, financial and social capital. Specifically, AF significantly improved financial capital in terms of timber, non-timber and fuel wood income. Furthermore, the physical capital (buffalo plough, generators and sprinklers), natural capital (the extent of cultivated land and land ownership; the number of households (HHs) growing vegetables, fruit crops and medicinal crops) and social capital (the number of social groups that HHs involved and number of HHs sharing crop seeds) of AF farmer HHs were significantly improved compared to those of CF farmers. However, the results show that financial capital gain through crop income, HHs owning high-value vehicles (tractors) and farmers trust and collective activities were significantly higher in CF farmers than AF ones. Therefore, to enhance the contribution of AF to rural livelihood, advanced extension services and government involvement on research planning and implementing are needed.

TI  - Cambodian peasant's contribution to rural development: a perspective from Kampong Thom Province
T2  - BIOTECHNOLOGIE AGRONOMIE SOCIETE ET ENVIRONNEMENT
AB  - The paper aims to identify the rationality of peasant communities and their contribution to rural development in Kampong Thom province. To do so, an interdisciplinary analytical framework addresses the dynamics of land use and land tenure, the strategies of labor force allocation as well as the determinants of land and labor agricultural productivities amongst peasant communities. It rests on details field surveys in two communes located in very distinct agro-ecological settings of Kampong Thom province. A land use change analysis based on time-series aerial photos is conducted with participatory inventories of natural resources. It shows that endogenous management of forest and fisheries resources generate significant incomes and, at the same time, contribute to maintaining biodiversity. The paper analyses how this contribution is challenged by the non-peasant actors involved in massive State land privatization. Aiming to full employment, peasant households enjoy a great flexibility in the way they allocate labor force, especially in line with the age of active labor and the fluctuation of labor opportunity costs. Principally due to an unequal land holding distribution, agricultural income is unfairly distributed but this inequality is actually balanced by the access to common-pool resources of crucial importance for the poorest and by the recourse to non farming activities, which is an important factor of socio-economic differentiation amongst households. The main economic indicators of rice production confirm that peasant households always try to maximize their income in step with the production factor they have in relatively less amount. A land market simulation stresses that, contrarily to theoretical assumptions, land access through sale ( and purchase) does not result in a fairer land distribution. Nevertheless, land leases amongst peasant households seem more promising to ensure equitable access to land as they are embedded in collective security mechanisms activated by peasantry. The paper argues that peasant communities in the studied area constitute a solid basis for rural development as they offer a very good articulation between economic efficiency, social justice and environmental sustainability. Finally, recommendations are formulated to properly address peasant contribution to rural development in the new national agrarian policies.

TI  - Can private food standards promote gender equality in the small farm sector?
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Agricultural commercialization can help to lift subsistence farmers out of poverty, but can also have adverse effects on gender equality. We explore whether private food standards - with their particular elements to regulate production and trade-could serve as a vehicle to promote gender equality in the small farm sector. We use gender-disaggregated data from coffee producers in Uganda and focus on two sustainability standards that explicitly address gender issues, namely Fairtrade and UTZ. Entropy balancing techniques, combined with estimates of farmers' willingness to accept standards, are used to control for possible selection bias when comparing certified and non-certified households. We find that standards and their certification programs increase wealth in male-headed and female-headed households. In male-headed households, standards also change the intra-household distribution of asset ownership: while in non-certified households, assets are predominantly owned by the male household head alone, in certified households most assets are jointly owned by the male head and his female spouse. Standards also improve access to agricultural extension for both male and female farmers. Effects on women's access to financial services are statistically insignificant. Private standards cannot completely eliminate gender disparities, but the findings suggest that they can contribute towards this goal.

TI  - Scaling up sanitation: Evidence from an RCT in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - We investigate the impacts of a widely used sanitation intervention, Community-Led Total Sanitation, which was implemented at scale across rural areas of Indonesia with a randomized controlled trial to evaluate its effectiveness. The program resulted in modest increases in toilet construction, decreased community tolerance of open defecation and reduced roundworm infestations in children. However, there was no impact on anemia, height or weight. We find important heterogeneity along three dimensions: (1) poverty-poorer households are limited in their ability to improve sanitation; (2) implementer identity-scale up involves local governments taking over implementation from World Bank contractors yet no sanitation and health benefits accrue in villages with local government implementation; and (3) initial levels of social capital-villages with high initial social capital built toilets whereas the community-led approach was counterproductive in low social capital villages with fewer toilets being built.

TI  - Safeguarding inheritance and enhancing the resilience of orphaned young people living in child- and youth-headed households in Tanzania and Uganda
T2  - AJAR-AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AIDS RESEARCH
AB  - This article explores the resilience of orphaned young people in safeguarding physical assets (land and property) inherited from their parents and sustaining their households without a co-resident adult relative. Drawing on the concept of resilience and the sustainable livelihoods framework, the article analyses the findings of an exploratory study conducted in 2008-2009 in Tanzania and Uganda with 15 orphaned young people heading households, 18 of their siblings, and 39 NGO workers and community members. The findings suggest that inherited land and property were key determining factors in the formation and viability of the child- and youth-headed households in both rural and urban areas. Despite experiences of stigma and marginalisation in the community, social networks were crucial in enabling the young people to protect themselves and their property, providing access to material and emotional resources, and enhancing their skills and capabilities to develop sustainable livelihoods. Support for child- and youth-headed households needs to recognise young people's agency and should adopt a holistic approach to their lives by analysing the physical assets, material resources, and human and social capital available to the household, as well as giving consideration to individual young people's wellbeing, outlook and aspirations. Alongside cash transfers and material support, youth-led collective mobilisation that is sustained over time may also help build resilience and foster supportive social environments in order to challenge property-grabbing and the stigmatisation of child- and youth-headed households.

TI  - Collective violence and attitudes of women toward intimate partner violence: Evidence from the Niger Delta
T2  - BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS
AB  - Background: The Niger Delta region of Nigeria has been undergoing collective violence for over 25 years, which has constituted a major public health problem. The objectives of this study were to investigate the predictors of women's attitudes toward intimate partner violence in the Niger Delta in comparison to that of women in other parts of Nigeria.
   Methods: The 2003 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey was used for this study. Respondents were selected using a stratified two-stage cluster sampling procedure through which 3725 women were selected and interviewed. These women contributed 6029 live born children born to the survey. Internal consistency of the measure of the women's attitudes towards intimate partner violence against a woman was assessed using Cronbach's alpha (a). Percentage distributions of the relevant characteristics of the respondents were carried out, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to measure the magnitude and direction of the relationship between the outcome and predictor variables were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and statistical significance was determined at the 95 percent confident interval level (CI).
   Results: Tolerance for intimate partner violence among the women in the Niger delta (47 percent) was higher than that of women from the rest of the country (42 percent). Rural residence, lower household wealth, lower status occupations, and media access (newspaper and radio) were associated with higher risk of justifying IPV among the women in the Niger Delta. In contrast full or partial autonomy in household decisions regarding food to be cooked, and access to television were associated with a lower risk of justifying violence.
   Conclusion: The increased justification of intimate partner violence among the women in the Niger Delta could be explained by a combination of factors, among which are cognitive dissonance theory (attitudes that do not fit with other opinions they hold as a means of coping with their situation), ecological theory (behaviour or attitudes being shaped by current factors in their neighbourhood, community or family), and gender-role attitudes. Further in-depth studies are required to fully understand women's attitudes toward violence in areas of conflict.

Since government initiatives to promote mechanization are confronted with major governance challenges, private-sector initiatives may offer a promising alternative. However, given limited scientific studies on such private-sector options such approaches are often viewed skeptically. One concern is that multi-national agribusiness companies take advantage of smallholder farmers. Another concern is that mechanization causes rural unemployment. To shed light on these concerns, this paper analyzes an initiative of the agricultural machinery manufacturer John Deere to promote smallholder mechanization in Zambia through a contractor model. The analysis focuses on the impact of this initiative on farmers who receive tractor services using Propensity Score Matching. The results indicate that farmers can almost double their income by cultivating a much larger share of their land. The analysis suggests that the increased income is used for children's education and more food, but does not result in increased food diversity. The demand for hired labor increases due to land expansion and due to a shift from family labor, including that of children, to hired labor. Questions that require further investigation are identified, including strategies to incentivize tractor owners to provide services, to also increase land productivity, and to avoid new forms of dependency of agricultural laborers that may result from a shift in the timing of the labor demand.

TI  - An Alternative Rangeland Management Strategy in an Agro-Pastoral Area in Western China
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Governance plays a key role in rangeland management. In China, all rangeland, including pastoral land and agro-pastoral land, is owned by the State. Since 1980, use rights have been granted to households by the Chinese government extending the household contract responsibility system (HCRS). But in the agro-pastoral areas of northwestern (NW) China, the rangeland degradation is more severe than that in pastoral areas. The HCRS is difficult to implement because the limited and fragmented grazing land cannot be contracted to individual households. Thus the pastures in the agro-pastoral areas are grazed as communal pastoral land and the rate of rangeland degradation has accelerated as livestock numbers have grown. Several measures have been introduced in an attempt to reverse this degradation trend, but most failed. This paper reports a 5-year comparison of three rangeland management regimens, including the national "Protecting rangeland by restricting grazing" (PRRG) project under the individual HCRS (PRRG under IHCRS), the Allied Householders Contract Responsibility System (AHCRS) program funded by the World Bank/GEF, and the free grazing on common pasture as the control area (CA) at Mayinggou Village, Yongchang County, Gansu Province in NW China. The results showed significant differences (P < 0.05) between AHCRS and the other two regimens (PRRG under IHCRS and CA) in terms of biomass of palatable forages, cover, and plant diversity index of vegetation but no significant difference (P > 0.05) between PRRG under IHCRS and CA. Reducing the number of livestock in AHCRS also resulted in increased revenue from the livestock turn-off rate compared with that in PRRG under IHCRS and CA. Therefore, AHCRS is a better alternative management regimen for rangelands in agro-pastoral areas. AHCRS can solve the overgrazing problem, maintain or improve household income, and potentially ensure a long-term sustainable rangeland management regimen in agro-pastoral areas in NW China.

TI  - Using a multi-stakeholder approach to increase value for traditional agroforestry systems: the case of baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) in Kilifi, Kenya
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - The baobab tree (Adansonia digitata L.) is an integral component of many dryland farming systems in sub-Sahara Africa. Such traditional agroforestry systems can foster a variety of benefits; besides positive livelihood implications baobab can particularly address food security objectives due to its highly nutritious fruits. However, many bottlenecks persist inhibiting the broader potential of indigenous trees in farming systems and their increased utilisation and commercialisation. We suggest that traditional farming systems with baobab trees can be advanced by stimulating the emergence of local markets for baobab products while promoting businesses and innovations aimed at meeting the arising market demand. Increasing the perceived value of local agroforestry products in combination with facilitating additional commercialisation pathways will in turn lead to food security and livelihood benefits. Using a multi-stakeholder approach such considerations were put into practice in Kilifi, Kenya, by initiating a community-based enterprise development producing high-quality baobab powder and oil. Initial results demonstrate behavioural changes, an improved practical knowhow with regard to baobab management and utilisation, and an increased consumption of baobab, which may already contribute to food security objectives. Baobab is increasingly seen as a valuable resource as opposed to 'food for the poor' and a tree possessed by evil spirits. This may lay the groundwork for further value addition activities and enterprise development in the communities. With baobab being a common, yet so far underutilised feature of local farming systems in Kilifi, activities based on its increasing commercialisation can be complementary and easily integrable to prevailing livelihood strategies.

TI  - The Myth of Complex Cocoa Agroforests: The Case of Ghana
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
AB  - Most researchers defend cocoa agroforests as a model, which guarantees sustainable cocoa production while protecting biodiversity. However, in most countries, farmers' strategies favour "full sun" cocoa farms, close to the concept of monoculture. Why this apparent paradox? Field surveys were conducted in 2005 and 2008 with 180 migrant and autochthon farmers in four districts of Ghana, including some measurements at the farm plot level and satellite images in a fifth district. An analytical grid shows how factors interact. Adoption of sun-loving hybrids; farmers' negative perception of ecological services in relation to hybrids; legislation excluding smallholders from the legal timber market; recent expansion of the timber industry; and the migratory phenomenon. Most smallholders consider complex cocoa agroforests as a thing of the past. They were designed at a time when land and forests were abundant. The future of cocoa and timber may lie in 'light commercial-oriented agroforests' or a kind of mosaic landscape.

TI  - Cooperative patronage: The National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi in Kasungu District
T2  - DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB  - This paper estimates the determinants of farmers' decisions to join a rural producer organisation, the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi (NASFAM), in Kasungu District. Data for the study were collected in June and August 2003 using household-level questionnaires and stratified random sampling, where strata were membership status and gender. Probit analysis of 250 farmers shows that off-farm sources of income, distance of the farmer's household from Kasungu District centre, age of the farmer, tobacco farming, education, household level land holding and gender determined the decision to join NASFAM. These results suggest that farmers should be informed of the potential benefits of participating in rural development efforts, and that rural communication and information infrastructure should be improved so as to reduce the costs of information access and transactions in general, if participation in organisations such as NASFAM is to be enhanced.

TI  - Community-based monitoring to facilitate water management by local institutions in Costa Rica
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Water scarcity is a global problem that can be compounded by inefficient water management, including underinvestment in infrastructure, underpricing of water use, and underenforcement of user rules. Here, we explore whether these inefficiencies can be reduced in rural Costa Rica via an externally driven community monitoring program (i.e., a program initiated by an outside organization and run by citizens). The monitoring program aimed to reduce groundwater extraction from aquifers, as well as to improve water quality and user satisfaction, by supplying additional information about field conditions and additional scrutiny of user and management authority activities and by fostering citizen engagement in water management. Using a specially designed smartphone application (app) and WhatsApp, monitors could report weekly on the conditions of the water system, including service disruptions, water quality, leaks, and source contamination. The app automatically compiled the individual reports into a summary report, which was then made available to the community water management committees and water users. The program was randomly implemented in 80 of 161 communities that expressed an interest in participating. One year after the program started, we detect modest, albeit imprecisely estimated, effects of the program in the predicted directions: less groundwater extracted, better water quality, and more satisfied users. Although the estimated effects are imprecise, the monitoring program appears to be equally or more cost effective for reducing groundwater extraction than another program in the same region that encouraged households to adopt water-efficient technologies.

TI  - The direct and indirect effect of cash transfers: the case of Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of unconditional cash transfers in Indonesia on poverty and inequality while, unlike much of the previous literature on the welfare impact of such transfers, acknowledging that they will have both a direct effect and an economy-wide effect on the national economy.
   Design/methodology/approach The methodology used is a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model of the Indonesian economy. The unique feature of this model, which is very relevant in this study, is the disaggregation of households by expenditure classes; this allows for precise estimation of the distributional impact and poverty incidence.
   Findings The results suggest that, despite a large reduction in poverty, particularly in rural areas, such transfers reduce the Indonesian GDP, especially if domestically financed through increasing the value added tax of all commodities. However, the GDP reduction can be reduced by approximately half when cash transfers are financed by reducing the distortionary fuel subsidy. Moreover, cash transfers financed by reducing the fuel subsidy also reduce inequality by much more than otherwise. Various extents of the distribution of the transfers are compared, from giving them to the poorest 10 percent to distributing them equally to all households. The benefit of the transfers, in terms of reduced poverty and inequality, is found to be smaller when the author extends the beneficiaries toward the non-poor, although the economy-wide cost, in terms of the reduced GDP, is smaller.
   Research limitations/implications The CGE model used in this model is a comparative-static model that does not explicitly model the time dimension, i.e. how the impact of the transfers evolves over time. This is important if we want to know the timing of the transfers and how and when they are translated into impacts.
   Practical implications To reduce the contractionary effect of cash transfers program, government/policy makers should carefully look for appropriate financing such as from removing subsidy with pre-existing distortions like fuel subsidies.
   Social implications Government needs to carefully design cash transfers to minimize the negative indirect (economy-wide) implication for the national economy and to make sure that the transfers reach the targeted beneficiaries.
   Originality/value Few previous studies have acknowledged the indirect economy-wide effect in analyzing the impact of cash transfers. To the author's knowledge, this has never been done before for Indonesia. Unlike previous studies, this paper is unique as it contains sensitivity analysis on how transfers can be mistargeted and reach the non-poor and looks at the implications not only for poverty and inequality but also for the rest of the economy.

TI  - Assessing the role of learning devices and geovisualisation tools for collective action in natural resource management: Experiences from Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - In northern Vietnam uplands the successive policy reforms that accompanied agricultural decollectivisition triggered very rapid changes in land use in the 1990s. From a centralized system of natural resource management, a multitude of individual strategies emerged which contributed to new production interactions among farming households, changes in landscape structures, and conflicting strategies among local stakeholders. Within this context of agrarian transition, learning devices can help local communities to collectively design their own course of action towards sustainable natural resource management.
   This paper presents a collaborative approach combining a number of participatory methods and geovisualisation tools (e.g., spatially explicit multi-agent models and role-playing games) with the shared goal to analyse and represent the interactions between: (i) decision-making processes by individual farmers based on the resource profiles of their farms; (ii) the institutions which regulate resource access and usage; and (iii) the biophysical and socioeconomic environment. This methodological pathway is illustrated by a case study in Bac Kan Province where it successfully led to a communication platform on natural resource management.
   In a context of rapid socioeconomic changes, learning devices and geovisualisation tools helped embed the participatory approach within a process of community development. The combination of different tools, each with its own advantages and constraints, proved highly relevant for supporting collective natural resource management. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - An Analysis of the Factors Influencing Marketing Channel Choice by Paddy Rice Farmers in Myanmar
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
AB  - Rice industry is vital for food security and the economic development of Myanmar as its economy relies on agriculture sector. Promoting the marketing capability of farmers especially the smallholders is the key challenge of increasing farm investment. The rice farmers generally have channels selling to (1) the brokers or commission men who come and collect at the farm gate, (2) the collectors or traders at the farm gate, and (3) selling directly to the rice mills nearby towns. Assessing from different channels is central for exploiting the potential to increase production, farm income and investment. However there are restrictions in channel choices because of poor infrastructure, lack of marketing facilities, insufficient credit and up to date market information. Moreover, due to the oligopsony market structure and without organization, individual marketing practices exposes them to high transaction costs with low bargaining position. The majority of farmers unable to receive a fair price as they have to sell their products soon after harvest when the price is generally low because of the immediate cash need for repayment. So, the farmers cannot maximize profit which in turn affects the future investment of paddy farmers. This paper investigates the factors determine the marketing channel choice using the Multinomial Logit Model. The results show the probability of selling at the farm gate is increase with the distance to market. The farmers who possess storage, transportation, larger quantity and access of market information are more likely to sell the remunerative direct marketing channels to the rice mills directly. The result underscore the importance of forming the farmers' cooperative, development of marketing infrastructures, accessibility of up to date marketing information in order to support farmers bargaining power to develop farm's profit and investment.

TI  - Maintaining the contract responsibility system of forest land distribution in China: Evidence from a novel financial compensation scheme in Daxi Village of Anji County, Zhejiang
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Guaranteeing households' equal access to land has long been advocated as paramount to implement development policies in Rural China. Given the chronic land scarcity in densely populated regions of China, finding a compromise between private and collective land rights has been important to protect livelihood safety nets and to address poverty issues in rural areas, especially in the initial stages of reform. In this sense, land reallocations in a context of demographic changes within households used to be a common practice in the agricultural sector as a way to protect the equal-per-capita land access right, whereas other mechanisms were required for longer-rotation forest resources. In this case study, we present the Inter-household Forest Compensation Scheme (IFCS), a local innovation in forest management that originated spontaneously in Anji county, in which households that have gained disproportionately large per capita forest resources due to a decrease in household members compensate households that have smaller per capita endowments due to expanding household size. Based on field interviews and household and village socioeconomic data from Daxi village, we analyze the effects of population, economic, household and opinion dynamics on the IFCS as well as its evolution and implementation problems. The compensation, which represents between 7% and 9% of household forest income and less than 2% of current total household income, has allowed for a significant increase in land productivity. The IFCS has proven to be an effective instrument to adjust a system based on a per-capita land allocation without resorting to potentially unsustainable forest reallocations, thus achieving a valuable compromise between equity and efficiency during a major transition from a planned to market economy. Increased population, off-farm income growth and differences in household structure bring new challenges to the policy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Marginalization and Community Perception of HIV Care, Treatment, and Support on Mfangano Island, Kenya
T2  - PROGRESS IN COMMUNITY HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS-RESEARCH EDUCATION AND ACTION
AB  - Background: In rural sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS pandemic has exerted effects on nearly every aspect of life. Yet despite the pandemic's near ubiquitous impacts, major barriers to HIV care, treatment, and support persist. Compounding the barriers to care is the incredible complexity and diversity of experience across different sociocultural contexts.
   Objectives: This exploratory community-based participatory study aimed to generate an explanatory model about how geographic and socioeconomic marginalization shape community perception of HIV care, treatment, and support among rural communities of Mfangano Island, Kenya.
   Methods: Twelve focus groups with a total of 105 participants were conducted as a part of a mixed-methods cross-sectional health study.
   Results: Study findings are organized within an ecological framework with the following themes: readiness at the individual level, social capital at the household level, and collective efficacy at the community level. Potential solutions were also described within this framework; enabling encouragement at the individual level, enhancing productivity at the household level, and addressing underlying socioeconomic inequities at the community level.
   Conclusions: HIV-related consequences at the individual, household, and community levels have adversely affected how Mfangano communities respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Community-based strategies are needed to address interrelated inequities at multiple levels. Changing community perception may overcome HIV stigma to enable individual readiness to seek care. Access to care and treatment enhances productivity and hence social capital in HIV-affected households. Addressing socioeconomic inequities at the community level increases access to social and instrumental support and, thus, may decrease risk and vulnerability for HIV/AIDS.

TI  - Environmental income and remittances: Evidence from rural central highlands of Vietnam
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Extraction of environmental resources and migration are closely related livelihood strategies of rural households in developing countries. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the relationship between environmental income and remittances is needed to lower the existing pressure on environmental resources and to promote rural development. This study aims at investigating this relationship by using panel data at the household and village levels collected in 2013, 2016, and 2017 from three provinces in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. A Heckman model is applied to identify the factors of the decision to send remittances. A fixed effects two-stage least squares analysis is conducted to investigate the determinants of environmental income and a quantile regression shows the distribution of effects. The findings reveal differences between asset-poor and -rich households. Since the former are often more dependent on labour-intensive livelihood strategies such as extraction, a decrease in household labour due to migration leads to reduced extraction. For asset-rich households who are normally less capital-constrained, remittances lead to more extraction of natural resources. The findings support the claim for encouraging rural labour markets and education, especially for asset-poor people, and for a sustainable and collective natural resource management.

TI  - Adoption of environmentally friendly agricultural technologies among smallholder farmers: The case of rocket barn technology in flue-cured tobacco curing in Uganda
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Tobacco production, and curing is the single most important contributor to soil degradation and deforestation in Uganda. To minimise the environmental effects associated with tobacco production, the environmentally friendly, as well as energy-efficient, rocket barn technology was developed. In spite of its energy saving and environmental benefits, the adoption of rocket barn technology remains low and understudied. This paper assessed farmers' perception and factors affecting the adoption of rocket barn technology in Uganda. Data were collected through a cross-sectional survey using structured questionnaires from 242 flue-cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco farmers in Uganda. The analysis was done using SPSS and STATA software. Results showed that the adoption of rocket barn technology was low, at 12%, with farmers perceiving the technology to be risky and costly. Experience, training, distance to wood fuel source, access to extension information, and benefits and risk perceptions were the major determinants of adoption of rocket barn technology. Promotion and adoption of rocket barn technology will therefore require concerted efforts in extension and training of farmers on the environmental benefits of the technology. Such promotional efforts should target the relatively inexperienced young FCV tobacco farmers.

TI  - The impact of the land certificated program on the farmland rental market in rural China
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - The Chinese central government began the new round Land Certificated Program (LCP) in 2011, which separates operational land rights from previous contract rights to further improve the efficiency of farmland use. This paper aims to assess its impact therein. We use a dataset collected by the authors themselves of more than 2000 households in 2016, which was a random, nationally representative sample of 100 rural villages among five provinces in China. We first analyze the status of the LCP, and then use the sample villages wherein LCP has either finished or not yet begun in order to conduct empirical analysis with Probit/Tobit regression and Propensity Score Matching methods. Our results indicate that the LCP significantly increase the likelihood that household would rent in land, improve the amount of land rented in and enhance the intensity of land rented in. However, the LCP has no effect on land rented out. The paper concludes with policy implications for the development of the land rental market to facilitate land transfer and consolidation, and identifies potential research paths for further study.

TI  - Household and local forest impacts of Morocco's argan oil bonanza
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - Morocco's argan oil is now the most expensive edible oil in the world. Growing high-value argan markets have sparked a bonanza of argan activity. NGOs, international and domestic development agencies, and argan oil cooperatives have promoted the win win aim of simultaneously benefiting locals and the argan forest. We test this win win claim by surveying households before and after rapid appreciation in argan prices. The argan boom has benefited some rural households. Those well positioned to benefit increased their goat herds more than other households, which bodes poorly for forest impacts, and were more likely to send their girls to secondary school. While locals are keeping their goats out of argan trees during the harvest, they may also be resorting to more aggressive harvesting techniques. The boom has made households vigilant guardians of fruit on their own trees, but has not incited investments in longer term tree and forest health.

TI  - Farmer-led participatory extension leads Haitian farmers to anticipate climate-related risks and adjust livelihood strategies
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Farmers globally are facing challenges associated with climate variability and change. In Haiti, where agriculture is predominantly non-mechanized and rainfed, smallholder farmers are severely affected by reduced yields and increases in operating costs. We evaluate the Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture (PICSA) approach with farmers who live in mountainous areas outside of Port-au-Prince ahead of the 2019 spring growing season. We use quantitative surveys and qualitative case studies to measure farmers' understanding and use of PICSA information and tools, and perceived effects on their farming and households. Seventy percent of survey respondents (63% women) reported that training in PICSA led them to make positive changes in their farming and livelihood enterprises. While most of the changes pertained to the management of existing farming enterprises, farmers also made changes in scale and started new enterprises. The analysis of qualitative case studies provides an in-depth understanding of perceived benefits on farmers' income, food security, confidence and their attitudes towards farming and climate risk. PICSA builds farmers' self-efficacy by enabling them to focus and reflect on their individual context while collectively analyzing and interpreting relevant information on climate and livelihood options. This study has important implications for future adaptation interventions where extension services and climate information are limited.

TI  - Has China's New Round of Collective Forestland Tenure Reform Caused an Increase in Rural Labor Transfer?

AB  - To investigate the rural labor transfer effects of China's Collective Forestland Tenure Reform (CFTR), we employ binary probit models by using survey data of 694 households from China's northern collective forest areas. The results reveal that the improved property rights, including rights for forestland use, disposition and beneficiaries, and refined tenure security under the CFTR generally have caused an increase in rural household labor transfer to the nonfarm sector. Besides, we find that forestry-dominated households' risk perceptions on forestland reallocation and expropriation have significantly dampened rural labor transfer to the nonfarm sector. These can be explained by the fact that the strengthening of forestland property rights brought about by the CFTR can promote an increase in the forestland transfer rate and improve the forestland relocation efficiency. This, in turn, will lead to the liberation of the rural labor force, increase the non-agricultural employment rate of farmers, and ultimately lead to an increase in the rural labor transfer to the nonfarm sector. Therefore, these findings indicate that to motivate rural labor transfer to the nonfarm sector in the context of the Chinese government's call for urbanization and other developing countries' handling of similar circumstances, policymakers should further refine household forestland property rights and better protect forestland tenure security by continuing to improve related forestry policies.

TI  - Is social capital associated with HIV risk in rural South Africa?
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - The role of social capital in promoting health is now widely debated within international public health. In relation to HIV, the results of previous observational and cross-sectional studies have been mixed. In some settings it has been suggested that high levels of social capital and community cohesion might be protective and facilitate more effective collective responses to the epidemic. In others, group membership has been a risk factor for HIV infection. There have been few attempts to strengthen social capital, particularly in developing countries, and examine its effect on vulnerability to HIV. Employing data from an intervention study, we examined associations between social capital and HIV risk among 1063 14 to 35-year-old male and female residents of 750 poor households from 8 villages in rural Limpopo province, South Africa. We assessed cognitive social capital (CSC) and structural social capital (SSC) separately, and examined associations with numerous aspects of HIV-related psycho-social attributes, risk behavior, prevalence and incidence. Among males, after adjusting for potential confounders, residing in households with greater levels of CSC was linked to lower HIV prevalence and higher levels of condom use. Among females, similar patterns of relationships with CSC were observed. However, while greater SSC was associated with protective psychosocial attributes and risk behavior, it was also associated with higher rates of HIV infection. This work underscores the complex and nuanced relationship between social capital and HIV risk in a rural African context. We suggest that not all social capital is protective or health promotive, and that getting the balance right is critical to informing HIV prevention efforts. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Assessing rural farmers' willingness to pay for crop insurance scheme: Evidence from Rwanda
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - Agriculture plays a significant role in Rwanda's economic growth but is still highly rain-fed with risks and losses caused by adverse natural and climate shocks. Agricultural insurance schemes are widely recognized as potential risk management strategies. This study aims to examine the determinants of farmers' willingness to insure maize farms and the premium farmers are willing to pay for crop insurance. The data used in this study were obtained from a household survey conducted in Eastern Rwanda and a sample of 325 households was drawn. A double-hurdle model is used for empirical analysis and the findings show that education, land tenure, farm size, group membership, and insurance awareness have a positive effect on maize farmers' decision to adopt crop insurance. Regarding the determinants of willingness to pay, education, land tenure, farm size, credit access, and income positively influenced the insurance premium maize farmers were willing to pay whereas household size negatively influenced the premium farmers were willing to pay for crop insurance. The study recommends policy frameworks that strengthen the education in rural communities about the usefulness of crop insurance to enhance farmers' participation in crop insurance and increase the premium farmers will be willing to pay for crop insurance. Besides, the study highlights the importance of building the capacity of farmers' groups or cooperatives to promote the uptake of crop insurance as well as the premium to be paid. The study also recommends the improvement of farmers' access to credit facilities to allow farmers to get the financial capability.

TI  - The impact of cooperatives on agricultural technology adoption: Empirical evidence from Ethiopia
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Using cross-sectional data and a propensity score matching technique, this paper investigates the impact of cooperatives on adoption of agricultural technologies. Our analysis indicates that cooperative members are more likely to be male-headed households, have better access to agricultural extension services, possess oxen, participate in off-farm work, and have leadership experience. We also found that geographic location and age of household head are strongly associated with cooperative membership. Our estimation results show that cooperative membership has a strong positive impact on fertilizer adoption. The impact on adoption of pesticides turns out to be statistically significant when only agricultural cooperatives are considered. Further analysis also suggests that cooperative membership has a heterogeneous impact on fertilizer adoption among its members. The results suggest that cooperatives can play an important role in accelerating the adoption of agricultural technologies by smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Local gender contract and adaptive capacity in smallholder irrigation farming: a case study from the Kenyan drylands
T2  - GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE
AB  - This article presents the local gender contract of a smallholder irrigation farming community in Sibou, Kenya. Women's role in subsistence farming in Africa has mostly been analyzed through the lens of gender division of labor. In addition to this, we used the concept of 'local gender contract' to analyze cultural and material preconditions shaping gender-specific tasks in agricultural production, and consequently, men's and women's different strategies for adapting to climate variability. We show that the introduction of cash crops, as a trigger for negotiating women's and men's roles in the agricultural production, results in a process of gender contract renegotiation, and that families engaged in cash cropping are in the process of shifting from a 'local resource contract' to a 'household income contract.' Based on our analysis, we argue that a transformation of the local gender contract will have a direct impact on the community's adaptive capacity climate variability. It is, therefore, important to take the negotiation of local gender contracts into account in assessments of farming communities' adaptive capacity.

TI  - Market structure, outgrower contracts, and farm output. Evidence from cotton reforms in Zambia
T2  - OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES
AB  - This paper investigates the dynamic impacts of cotton marketing reforms on farm output in rural Zambia. Following liberalization and the elimination of the Zambian cotton marketing board, the sector developed an outgrower scheme whereby cotton firms provided credit, access to inputs and output markets, and technical assistance to the farmers. There are two distinctive phases of the reforms: a failure of the outgrower contracts, due to farmers' debt renegation, firm hold up, and lack of coordination among firms and farms, and a subsequent period of success of the scheme, due to enhanced contract enforcement and commitment. We find interesting dynamics in the sector. During the phase of failure, farmers were pushed back into subsistence and cotton yields per hectare declined. With the improvement of the outgrower scheme, farmers devoted larger shares of land to cash crops, and farm output significantly increased.

TI  - Agricultural commercialisation models, agrarian dynamics and local development in Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - The renewed commitment of African states to modernising agriculture has reignited longstanding debates about different models of agricultural commercialisation. Which forms of commercialisation models will reduce land dispossession and the impoverishment of smallholders, and transform smallholder agriculture and the wider economy? Of the three broad models of agriculture commercialisation in this debate - plantation, contract farming and medium-scale commercial farming - contract farming has been identified as central to the future of Africa's commercial agriculture. This paper provides empirical evidence from Ghana on the impacts of these three models on land, labour/employment, livelihoods and local economic linkages. Our findings show that the plantation and the commercial farming areas have highly commercialised land relations, land scarcity and high land prices, compared to the outgrower area where traditional systems of accessing land still dominate, enabling families to produce their own food crops while also diversifying into wage labour and other activities. Food insecurity was highest in the plantation area followed by the commercial area, but lowest in the outgrower area. Here, semi-proletarianised seasonal workers combine self-provisioning from their own farms with wages, and this results in better livelihood outcomes than for permanent workers in plantations and commercial farms. Due to the processing units in the plantation and the outgrower models, they provided more employment. However, the casualisation of labour and gender discrimination in employment and access to land occur in all three cases. All three models generated strong economic linkages mainly because they combined attributes such as processing, provided markets for nearby farmers, induced state infrastructural development and diffused technology in competitive ways. The effects of the models on household and local development are coproduced by their interaction with pre-existing conditions and wider national economic structures.

TI  - Government Policy and Performance of Agricultural Cooperatives: A Case Study in Chitwan District, Nepal
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Agricultural cooperatives are producer-owned and controlled organizations to improve farmers' livelihoods by correcting market failure. They support collective activities where individual incentives are insufficient to produce public goods. The government of Nepal has been investing economic resources in this sector, prioritizing cooperatives as part of a strategy for poverty reduction. This study examines poor farmers' access to agricultural cooperatives and the impact of membership on farm and total household income, based on a household survey of 572 households and key informant interviews of 37 cooperative managers. The ethnicity of the family and the neighborhood, smallholder land size, distance to an agricultural cooperative, distance to the nearest local market, and distance to a motorable road are key determinants that influence cooperative membership. The analysis of the effects of cooperative membership is based on propensity score matching, controlling for a large array of household and community characteristics. The estimates imply that cooperative membership may significantly affect family net crop income, but the overall effects on total family income are modest. Agricultural cooperatives appear to be focused on financial services such as savings and credit activities but are less concerned with agricultural production, and cooperatives engage in almost no marketing activities.

TI  - Are infectious reproductive pathogens of large ruminants a threat to improving food security? An investigation from Cambodia
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - In Cambodia, information on common pathogens causing reproductive losses in cattle and buffalo are lacking, despite there being a need to address livestock health to enhance food security. We analysed stored buffalo (n = 29) and cattle (n = 471) serum samples collected in 2016 using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Antibodies to Neospora caninum, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo and Brucella abortus were detected in buffalo samples at 79.3% (95% CI 64.6-94.0), 3.4% (95% CI 0-10.0), 0% and 0%, respectively, and in cattle at 4.2% (95% CI 2.4-6.0), 6.4% (95% CI 4.2-8.6), 8.1% (95% CI 5.6-10.6) and 0%, respectively. The high N. caninum seroprevalence in buffalo was associated with increasing age, with buffalo having a 13.1% chance of being seropositive at birth, increasing to 99.4% by age 7 (p = 0.045). This suggests a predominance of horizontal transmission, possibly from exposure to faeces from free-roaming village dogs. Cattle L. interrogans serovar Hardjo seroprevalence was highest in Tbong Khmum province (20.4%) compared to other provinces (p < 0.001), and may be compromising bovine fertility and creating a zoonotic risk for smallholders who may contract leptospirosis from farm work. These high infection rates prompt further research to determine: to what extent these pathogens are linked to the low reproductive efficiency observed in large ruminants in Cambodia, the risk factors to pathogen exposure and appropriate strategies to reduce these risks. Low BVDV and B. abortus exposure is an important observation. Increasing large ruminant livestock trade into the country will require improved biosecurity and disease surveillance to prevent their emergence. An enhanced understanding of the status of infectious reproductive livestock pathogens in Cambodia can assist development projects to make evidence-based strategies to enhance cattle and buffalo health and improve food security.

AB  - In this study, we attempt to examine the effects of participation in a rice out grower scheme on several outcomes, such as rice income and output price, in Vietnam's Mekong Delta by using the propensity score matching approach and employing cross-sectional data gathered from 248 rice growers. The results reveal that participation in the outgrower scheme has a significantly positive impact on farmers' rice income and output selling price. A possible implication of the results of this study is that the outgrower scheme may help increase rice households' income in the Mekong Delta.

TI  - Town dwellers in their networks: urban-rural mobility and household strategies in Cameroon
T2  - GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-DANISH JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Urban-rural interactions are important features of spatial dynamics in Africa that have been affected by recent economic, social and cultural transformations. The attention of academics and policy-makers has concentrated on the impact of such mobility on rural actors and economies. Our objective is to consider the point of view of urban households and to analyse how they manage to develop and use their "rural connections". The paper is based on in-depth qualitative fieldwork conducted in Cameroon, in Douala and Bafoussam. It presents an analysis of the configurations of urban resident mobility to rural regions. By mapping mobility we show the role of linkages with rural areas in urban household strategies. We also illustrate how a major city and a fast-growing secondary one differ in their connections with rural areas. The paper addresses what is one of the recurrent questions in the literature: will urban-rural linkages change in the long-term as the trend towards urbanization intensifies. Urban-rural mobility remains crucial, contributes to creating complex and dynamic networks. Collective connections are reaffirming the importance of the village and the region of origin. Mobility is a key element for many urban households in developing their urban position and strategies.

TI  - Joint market participation choices of smallholder farmers and households' welfare: evidence from Senegal
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose There is much evidence in the literature showing the benefits of input market participation on farmers' welfare. The same is true for participation in marketing. However, there are very few studies on the expected benefit of input market participation and marketing. This study fills this gap by examining the issue in the Senegalese context for food and cash crops. Design/methodology/approach The authors estimate a multinomial endogenous switching regression using a highly detailed 2017 agricultural survey in Senegal. They first identify factors that shape farmers' decision to participate in the input market and marketing and then assess the impact of market participation choices on farmers' profits. Findings The results show that the most profitable market participation regime depends on the crop under consideration. For food crops, joint participation in markets maximizes profit per hectare, while for groundnuts, the main cash crop in Senegal, participation in the input market is not necessary to maximize farm profit. Research limitations/implications Using panel data would improve the quality of estimations (time-variant effects) and help to consider the role of risk in output and input markets. Originality/value This paper helps to characterize different profiles of farmers based on their market participation and crop choices and provide policymakers with recommendations for maximizing farmers' profit.

TI  - Determinants of smallholder farmers' adoption of adaptation strategies to climate change in Eastern Tigray National Regional State of Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Climate change has been significantly affecting smallholder farmer's livelihood and food security. However, efforts to support farmer adaptation are hampered by the lack of scientific and context based evidences. Hence, this paper identified the major adaptation strategies to climate change (CC) and analysed the determinants of adoption of adaptation strategies to climate change in Eastern Tigray Region of Ethiopia. Three-stage sampling technique was used to select the study sites and sample households. Copies of 485 questionnaires were administered and complemented with data from focus group discussion and key informant interviews. Results of the descriptive analysis identified that use of soil and water conservation practices, planting trees, improved crop seeds, irrigation and use of non-farm income generating activities are the most utilized adaptation strategies to climate change. Results of the multinomial logistic regression (MNL) revealed that households' adaptation to climate change was found positively and significantly affected by education, livestock holding, cooperatives membership, extension services, farmers income and households perception to climate change. On the contrary, age of the household head, distance to market and agro-ecology were found negatively and statistically affecting smallholder farmers adoption of adaptation strategies to climate change. Thus, public policy on climate change adaptation need to take into account local people's resource base and their lifelong outlooks so as to reduce the potential drawbacks of climate change on farmers' livelihood.

TI  - Effects of the Chinese arable land fallow system and land-use change on agricultural production and on the economy
T2  - ECONOMIC MODELLING
AB  - This study focuses on economic effects of arable land fallow system and land-use change in China using a dynamic single-country, multi-regional computable general equilibrium model. Land supply is adjusted endogenously in our model. Land use in each of 31 provinces is tracked by a land-use change module, which is calibrated with satellite data. Our results reveal that the expansion of real output can be attributed to the increase in capital stock as a result of the growth of investment due to the imposition of the arable land fallow system in China. And the growth of investment is caused by the release of labor from agriculture The reduced supply of arable land in agricultural land contraction regions is partially offset by the increasing arable land in agricultural land expansion regions. Rural households benefit more than urban households from the arable land fallow policy due to relatively higher income and lower rural CPI.

TI  - Use of Single Large or Several Small Policies as Strategies to Manage People-Park Interactions
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Biodiversity conservation has been criticized for undermining or ignoring social well-being. Currently efforts to mutually promote social justice, rural development, and biodiversity conservation, which have been contentious and yielded mixed results, continue to spread despite a general dearth of effective management strategies. We contend that social and economic concerns should be integral to conservation planning and propose that the scale of these phenomena is also critical. To evaluate the merit of this proposal, we adopted and expanded a conservation management strategy framework developed by Joel Heinen and examined how population density, economic disparity, and ethnic heterogeneity vary spatially surrounding 2 contrasting protected areas in East Africa: Kibale National Park in Uganda and Tarangire National Park in Tanzania. Analyses of demographic, wealth, and ethnicity data from regional censuses and household surveys conducted in 2009 and 2010 indicated that choice of scale (landscape or community) changed the management strategies recommended by the model. Therefore, several small peoplepark management strategies varying around a given protected area may be more appropriate than a single large people-park strategy applied across an entire protected area. Correspondingly, scale adjusted Heinen recommendations offered new strategies for effective conservation management within these human landscapes not incorporated in current in situ management plans. Uso de Varias Politicas Pequenas o una unica Politica Mayor como Estrategias para Manejar las Interacciones Gente - Parque
   Resumen La conservacion de la biodiversidad ha sido criticada por socavar o ignorar el bienestar social. Hoy en dia los esfuerzos para promover mutuamente a la justicia social, el desarrollo rural y la conservacion de la biodiversidad, esfuerzos que han sido polemicos y que han arrojado resultados mixtos, se siguen esparciendo a pesar de una escasez general de estrategias de manejo efectivas. Sostenemos que las preocupaciones sociales y economicas deberian ser integrales para la planeacion de la conservacion y proponemos que la escala de estos fenomenos tambien es critica. Para evaluar el merito de esta propuesta, adoptamos y expandimos el marco de trabajo de una estrategia de manejo de conservacion desarrollado por Joel Heinen y examinamos como la densidad poblacional, la desigualdad economica y la heterogeneidad etnica varian espacialmente alrededor de 2 areas protegidas contrastantes en el este de africa: el Parque Nacional Kibale en Uganda y el Parque Nacional Tarangire en Tanzania. Los analisis de riqueza demografica y datos de etnicidad de censos regionales y encuestas en hogares llevados a cabo en 2009 y 2010 indicaron que la opcion de escala (terreno o comunidad) cambiaba las estrategias de manejo recomendadas por el modelo. A partir de esto, varias estrategias pequenas de manejo gente-parque que varian con respecto a un area protegida dada pueden ser mas apropiadas que una estrategia unica mayor aplicada en toda un area protegida. Por consecuencia, las recomendaciones de Heinen ajustadas a la escala ofrecieron nuevas estrategias para un manejo de la conservacion efectiva dentro de estos terrenos humanos no incorporados en planes de manejo in-situ actuales.

TI  - Assessing the Effects of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme on Alleviating the Health Payment-Induced Poverty in Shaanxi Province, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Disease has become one of the key causes of falling into poverty in rural China. The poor households are even more likely to suffer. The New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) has been implemented to provide rural residents financial protection against health risks. This study aims to assess the effect of the NCMS on alleviating health payment-induced poverty in the Shaanxi Province of China.
   Methods
   The data was drawn from the 5th National Health Service Survey of Shaanxi Province, conducted in 2013. In total, 41,037 individuals covered by NCMS were selected. Poverty headcount ratio (HCR), poverty gap and mean positive poverty gap were used for measuring the incidence, depth and intensity of poverty, respectively. The differences on poverty measures pre-and post-insurance reimbursement indicate the effectiveness of alleviating health payment-induced poverty under NCMS.
   Results
   For the general insured, 5.81% of households fell below the national poverty line owing to the health payment; this HCR dropped to 4.84% after insurance reimbursement. The poverty HCRs for the insured that had hospitalization in the past year dropped from 7.50% to 2.09% after reimbursement. With the NCMS compensation, the poverty gap declined from 42.90 Yuan to 34.49 Yuan (19.60% decreased) for the general insured and from 57.48 Yuan to 10.01 Yuan (82.59% decreased) for the hospital admission insured. The mean positive poverty gap declined 3.56% and 37.40% for two samples, respectively.
   Conclusion
   The NCMS could alleviate the health payment-induced poverty. The effectiveness of alleviating health payment-induced poverty is greater for hospital admission insured than for general insured, mainly because NCMS compensates for serious diseases. Our study suggests that a more comprehensive insurance benefit package design could further improve the effectiveness of poverty alleviation.

TI  - The subjective well-being effect of public goods provided by village collectives: Evidence from China
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Village collectives are important providers of rural public goods in developing countries with dual urban-rural structures. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between the public goods provided by village collectives and the subjective well-being (SWB) of rural residents. This study aims to fill that gap. Based on the 2014 round of China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) survey data, this study estimates an ordered logit model of a SWB function to examine the role of the public goods provided by village collectives. The results indicate that village collectives' provision of public goods has a significantly positive effect on the SWB of rural residents by promoting the dual growth of household income and consumption. Village collectives' public expenditures on production, education, and public services also positively affect the SWB of rural residents. The public goods provided by village collectives have a significantly positive effect on the SWB of young and middle-aged rural residents but not on the SWB of elderly rural residents. Finally, rural residents with low levels of education and health obtain more SWB effects than do residents with high levels.

TI  - Market outlet choices for African Indigenous Vegetables (AIVs): a socio-economic analysis of farmers in Zambia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD ECONOMICS
AB  - Agricultural research institutes in Sub-Sahara Africa have focused on establishing farmer groups that facilitate the commercial production and marketing of African Indigenous Vegetables (AIVs) to address food and nutritional security. With the freedom of selecting the choices of market outlets, we explored the factors such as farmers' characteristics, farm attributes, selling preferences, social relations, and other primary reasons that influence farmers' decision to choose a particular outlet to sell AIVs. A purposive random survey was conducted among the AIV farmers to understand the preferred market outlets for AIVs in Zambia. The results of the multinomial logit model indicate that male respondents are more likely to choose intermediary options to sell AIVs, particularly brokers and wholesalers. The rainfed farmers and those who receive primary income from farming activities are less likely to choose retailers and wholesalers to market their AIVs. Similarly, those who expect instant payment for their produce indicate that they are less likely to prefer retailers and brokers. Farmers who belong to the farmer's group exhibited a positive coefficient, meaning that they are more likely to choose intermediary options to sell their AIVs compared with the farmer-to-consumer direct sales option. However, good price, a positive momentum of AIVs price in the past, and processing activities were found to be insignificant determinants for market outlet choices when compared with farmer-to-consumer direct outlet option. Our findings could help to better cognize AIVs marketing channels and develop the intervention for new farmers to make an informed decision as to how best to market their AIVs.

TI  - Social Investment and Smallholder Coca Cultivation in Colombia
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - Colombia is the largest supplier of coca leaf in the world, and fields smaller than one-hectare account for more than 60 per cent of cultivation. Despite the obvious relevance of smallholding growers to the strategies to control illicit crops, there are few insights into what motivates these smallholders to cultivate coca. We analyse the motivations of coca growers by estimating a discrete choice model including head of household characteristics, household variables, and agricultural unit attributes. We found that extremely poor farmers are more likely to grow coca than non-poor farmers in the same area, while households connected to the energy grid, with access to credit, and receiving cash payments for their licit crops, are less likely to grow coca crops. Our results suggest that strategies aiming to discourage farmers from growing coca should: 1) target specifically the poorest households in the region and not just seek to improve general living conditions, 2) expand rural electrification, and 3) enhance legal productivity by providing access to credit, technical support, and/or contracts on harvests before planting.

TI  - Factors affecting forestland production efficiency in collective forest areas: A case study of 703 forestland plots and 290 rural households in Liaoning, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Facing the challenge of huge population and prominent contradiction between land supply and demand in China, improving the land use efficiency will be a crucial way to solve this contradiction. Based on microscopic sampling data for 703 forestland plots, maintained by 290 rural households, in 30 villages in Liaoning province, and using forestland plots as the decision making unit, the influencing factors of forestland production efficiency were analysed by means of econometric analysis. The results show that increasing household labour and mechanical services helps to improve the production efficiency of forestland. Rural households' willingness to transfer forestland is weak and the frequency of forestland transfers is relatively low; without action, forestland transfers can be expected to continue to fail to fulfil their potential in stimulating production efficiency. Collective forestland (predominantly public welfare forest) made a limited contribution to forestry production efficiency. From the perspective of property security, although the certification work has more or less been implemented, the factors of property rights certificates, management duration and forestland rights exerted no significant effect on forestland production efficiency. The security and stability of households' forest property rights urgently need to be consolidated. Moreover, although forest insurance has an important effect on forestland production efficiency, the proportion of households purchasing forest insurance is still low and needs to be improved. The development of forest rights mortgage loans is blocked, and these have not played a significant role in forestland production efficiency to date. Forestry subsidy mechanisms were not sound, and non subsidized forestland production efficiency was far higher than that of subsidized forest. As such, we conclude that forestry subsidies have failed to play a positive role in increasing efficiency. In order to promote forestland production efficiency and the sustainable growth of forestry, it is essential that emphasis be placed on forestland inputs, plot characteristics, property security and policy subsidies for micro-plots.

TI  - Land tenure, investment incentives, and the choice of techniques: Evidence from Nicaragua
T2  - WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - The choice of cultivation techniques is a key determinant of agricultural productivity and has important consequences for income growth and poverty reduction in developing countries. Household data from Nicaragua are used to show that the choice of cultivation technique depends on farmers' tenure status even when techniques are observable and contractible. In particular, tree crops are less likely to be grown on rented than on owner-cultivated plots. Further evidence indicates that the result follows from landlords' inability or unwillingness to commit to long-term tenancy contracts rather than from agency costs due to risk aversion or limited liability.

TI  - Climate change perception and its impact on net farm income of smallholder rice farmers in South-West, Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Climate change such as extreme weather, unexpected temperature and rainfall fluctuations cause several significant risks to the agro-economy. This study, therefore, assessed the determinants of climate change perception (CCP), the level of perception and its impact on net farm income of rice farmers. This is imperative as the actual CC communication and policy, therefore, require a good understanding of smallholders' views and acknowledgment of individual's perception about CC. Employing cross-sectional data from 360 rice farmers selected from three States in South-West, Nigeria, a Ricardian model was used to analyse climate change impact on rice production. While accounting for selection bias, the study employed a double-hurdle (DH) model to estimate the determinants of farmers' perception of climate change. The results of DH estimation model show that location, access to credit, educational level and household size of the farmers are statistically significant factors influencing climate change perception (CCP). The result from the second hurdle shows that the perceived intensity of climate change was influenced by farm size, farming experience, marital status and educational level of smallholder rice farmers. The Ricardian model's result shows that farmers' income is influenced by CCP and their socio-economic characteristics. The results further indicate that smallholder rice farmers' net farm income is sensitive to marginal changes in both temperature and precipitation. Thus, this study recommends that government policies and investment strategies should be geared towards the support of education and the improvement of farmers' cooperatives, credit facilities and information about climate change, particularly in respect of smallholder rice farmers in Nigeria. The recommended improvements are imperative for food security. Investment in farmer training programmes is essential for development and may also be a panacea for improving the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies with the overall goal of increasing productivity.

TI  - Impact of water-related collective action on rural household welfare in the Upper Ewaso Ng'iro North Catchment Area: The application of the endogenous switching regression
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - Key among government strategies to promote efficient and participatory water management in Kenya is through empowering local communities to manage water resources through Water Resource Users' Associations (WRUAs) which is a collective action initiative. However, there is contrasting empirical evidence on the welfare benefits households derive from this water governance mechanism. The study applied the endogenous switching regression to estimate the causal impact on household consumption per adult equivalent and household incomes per adult equivalent. The results indicate that WRUA membership has a positive and significant effect on household consumption per adult equivalent and household income per adult equivalent. The results show that non-members would have significant welfare improvements in their household consumption and incomes if they undertook WRUA membership.

TI  - Regulatory reform of seed systems: Benefits and impacts from a mungbean case study in Nepal
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB  - Mungbean (Vigna radiata (L). Wilczek) is becoming an important grain legume in Nepal. It can be grown as an additional crop after harvesting winter crops such as winter wheat, winter legumes and oilseeds and before planting main season rice from the low-altitude Terai through to the middle hills of Nepal. Replacing short fallows in the spring, it provides additional high quality food, enhances soil fertility and increases the yield of the following crop.
   In spite of continued varietal research by the National Grain Legume Research Programme, no mungbean varieties were released from 1975 to 2006. The old variety, Pusa Baishakhi, was released in 1975, but became susceptible to Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV) and several other diseases so mungbean became limited to a rarely grown, green manure crop. In 2003, we introduced four mungbean varieties resistant to MYMV from the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Centre. These were evaluated in participatory varietal selection (PVS) mother and baby trials in low fertility and droughted conditions using farmers' levels of inputs and management. Variety spread was promoted by distributing free small seed samples in a process known as Informal Research and Development (IRD); and community-based seed production and marketing. Of the four varieties, NM94 and VC6372 consistently produced higher grain yields than the local check varieties, were resistant to MYMV and hence were preferred by farmers. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives endorsed a new variety release procedure in 2005 that permitted the use of data from PVS trials to support the release or registration of new crop varieties. In 2006, on the basis of data generated from PVS trials alone, the National Seed Board released NM94 as 'Kalyan' while, on the basis of combined data from the PVS trials and from on-station trials, VC6372 (45-8-1) was released as 'Prateeksha'. The use of PVS contributed greatly to fast-tracking the release process and this resulted in farmers getting new MYMV-resistant mungbean varieties more quickly. Varieties spread rapidly through IRD and farmer-to-farmer seed networks and provided benefits to farming households. Regulatory reforms to speed up and simplify the process of varietal release are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mechanisms of Inclusion: Evidence from Zambia's Farmer Organisations
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Policymakers and donors increasingly rely on farmer organisations (FOs) when implementing rural development strategies, though research suggests that targeted groups such as poorer households tend to participate less in FOs than richer ones. Here, we discuss mechanisms that may contribute towards the inclusion of disadvantaged households, using primary data from Zambian FOs involved in implementing an agricultural subsidy programme, and applying qualitative comparative analysis to identify individual and combined effects of four explanatory factors on inclusion. Our results suggest long-term commitment as a necessary condition. We further identify three alternative pathways that explain inclusion while within-case analysis describes their underlying causal mechanism: inclusion develops in FOs that show commitment and either provide financial services to vulnerable members, promote social identities or compensate disadvantaged members for not being able to access subsidised inputs. These results can explain why some FOs are more effective than others in reaching disadvantaged target groups.

TI  - Impact of financial inclusion on poverty alleviation through cooperative banks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of financial inclusion on poverty alleviation through cooperative banks.
   Design/methodology/approach In order to fulfil the objectives of the study, primary data were collected from 540 beneficiaries of cooperative banks operating in three northern states of India, i.e., J&K, Himachal Pradesh (HP) and Punjab using purposive sampling during July-December 2015. The technique of factor analysis had been used for summarisation of the total data into minimum factors. For checking the validity and reliability of the data, the second-order CFA was performed. Statistical techniques like one-way ANOVA, t-test and SEM were used for data analysis.
   Findings The study results reveal that financial inclusion through cooperative banks has a direct and significant impact on poverty alleviation. The study highlights that access to basic financial services such as savings, loans, insurance, credit, etc., through financial inclusion has generated a positive impact on the lives of the poor and help them to come out of the clutches of poverty.
   Research limitations/implications The study was conducted amidst few limitations. First, the in-depth analysis of the study is restricted to three northern states only because of limited resources and time availability. Second, the study is limited to the perception of financial inclusion beneficiaries only, which, in future, could be carried further on the perception of other stakeholders such as bank officials, business correspondents, village panchayats, etc.
   Originality/value The study makes contribution towards the financial inclusion literature relating to poverty alleviation and fulfils the research gap to some extent by assessing the impact of financial inclusion on poverty alleviation through cooperative banks. This paper can help the policymakers and other stakeholders of cooperative banks in promoting banking habits among poor rural households both at the national and international level.

TI  - Unearthing the character of microfinance in self-employment generation for bridging the gaps of disparity: a case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP RESEARCH
AB  - The microfinance sector is all about making credit available to low-income households through an array of institutional channels, encompassing scheduled commercial banks, regional rural banks, small finance banks, self-help groups, business correspondents, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), cooperative banks and microfinance institutions (MFIs) registered as NBFCs. The Andhra Pradesh microfinance crisis of 2010, which led to the Y. H. Malegam committee regulatory framework applied to NBFC/MFIs, brought microfinance to the core of policymakers in India. At present, microfinance schemes serve to bridge economic disparity through the generation of self-employment in the rural sector. A qualitative study was undertaken in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in India to identify the influence of microcredit activities in the country for self-employment generation and understand the problems and issues from the perspective of actual borrower. The method employed was a case study analysis of actual borrowers to evaluate the contribution of microfinance towards the betterment of their lives, besides understanding the hassles faced by the borrowers in the entire process of microcredit lending, utilisation and repayment. In India, microfinance is still in its nascent stage despite the government's increasing focus on the proper functioning of all microfinance players through close supervision and digitisation. The study reported that government should focus on providing technical and business support to ensure that money lent is invested astutely and assist in the social and economic welfare of the beneficiary, not trapping them in indebtedness. The compulsory training and support regarding technical know-how, business procurement, financial planning and marketing skills clubbed with efficient monitoring facilitates achieving the real objectives behind microfinance. The challenge lies not in sanctioning credit but in ensuring the proper utilisation of the money to avoid non-payments and defaults. The study in hand proposed that integrating few alterations in microfinance system comprising knowledge sharing and training, raising microcredit amount and providing pre- and post-credit support will assist borrowers economically, socially and psychologically. Further microfinance help combat social issues like malnutrition, gender discrimination, poor literacy rate, domestic violence and poor quality of life in rural India through women empowerment and self-employment generation.

TI  - Effect of household and village characteristics on financial catastrophe and impoverishment due to health care spending in Western and Central Rural China: A multilevel analysis
T2  - HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS
AB  - Objective: The study aimed to examine the effect of household and community characteristics on financial catastrophe and impoverishment due to health payment in Western and Central Rural China.
   Methods: A household survey was conducted in 2008 in Hebei and Shaanxi provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region using a multi-stage sampling technique. Independent variables included village characteristics, household income, chronic illness status, health care use and health spending. A composite contextual variable, named village deprivation, was derived from socio-economic status and availability of health care facilities in each village using factor analysis. Dependent variables were whether household health payment was more than 40% of household's capacity to pay (catastrophic health payment) and whether household per capita income was put under Chinese national poverty line (1067 Yuan income per year) after health spending (impoverishment). Mixed effects logistic regression was used to assess the effect of the independent variables on the two outcomes.
   Results: Households with low per capita income, having elderly, hospitalized or chronically ill members, and whose head was unemployed were more likely to incur financial catastrophe and impoverishment due to health expenditure. Both catastrophic and impoverishing health payments increased with increased village deprivation. However, the presence of a village health clinic had no effect on the two outcomes, nor did household enrollment in the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (national health insurance).
   Conclusions: Village deprivation independently increases the risk for financial hardship due to health payment after adjusting for known household-level factors. This suggests that policy makers need to view the individual, household and village as separate units for policy targeting.

TI  - Farmer?s agency and institutional bricolage in land use plan implementation in upland Laos
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - This paper looks at the (re)shaping of local institutional arrangements within the context of land use planning processes in Laos, bringing to light their dynamic and co-constitutive relationship. Taking Pa Khom village in Houaphan province as a case study, it examines how local tenure institutions are (re)produced, (re)assembled and adapted to mirror farmer?s livelihood strategies to meet households? food security, while also conforming to the defined land use plan. Drawing on examples of changes in swidden agriculture and village grazing land arrangements introduced as part of land use planning, the paper highlights the important role played by local communities ? acting autonomously, collectively and in relation to external agents ? in reconfiguring the relationship between natural resources and institutional orders. It illustrates how farmers employ institutional bricolage to creatively assemble and reshape their land use arrangements to comply with the defined land use plan, thus ensuring it meets their locally embedded livelihood priorities, albeit with different distributional outcomes for various farm households. Linking farm households? strategies with inter-household and village level institutional arrangements, the paper shows how institutional bricolage contributes to synergizing the different rationales behind land use planning processes.

TI  - Farmers' Adoption of Low-Carbon Agriculture in China: An Extended Theory of the Planned Behavior Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Farmers' adoption of low-carbon agriculture is conductive to addressing climate change and achieving sustainable development of agriculture. The purpose of this study is to explore farmers' decision-making processes regarding low-carbon production and to provide a reference for the targeted support policies of low-carbon agriculture. The data was derived from a household survey of 442 rice farmers conducted in Jiangsu Province, China in 2017. Participants were interviewed face-to-face using questionnaires, and local interviewers were used in order to maximize the reliability of the results. The theoretical basis for our analysis was an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB). We applied a structural equation model (SEM) to investigate the correlations among farmers' decision-making processes regarding low-carbon production and observable characteristics. Furthermore, we explored the differences in adoption decisions regarding low-carbon agriculture among different groups of farmers based on production scale and region, respectively. The results indicate that attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and contract farming participation are significantly positively correlated with farmers' intention toward low-carbon production, and that farmers' low-carbon production intention and contract farming participation have significant positive correlations with their behavior regarding low-carbon production. A subsample analysis shows that the subjective norm for farmers with a small production scale is more strongly correlated with their adoption decisions regarding low-carbon agriculture than that it is for farmers with a large production scale. Additionally, in less developed regions, farmers' attitude is more strongly correlated with their adoption decisions regarding low-carbon agriculture than it is for farmers in developed regions.

TI  - Livestock and land share contracts in a Hindu society
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This article examines factors related to a livestock rental market in western Nepal and assesses whether this market is associated with caste differentiation and land rental market participation. Theoretical models for asset-rich (i.e., high-caste) households, rich in land and livestock, and asset-poor (i.e., low-caste families) households are presented to provide logical explanations for the existence of a livestock rental market and the synergy between livestock and land rental markets participation. A combination of double hurdle models and bivariate-ordered probit models were used to test the implications of the models. Consistent with the theoretical models, land- and livestock-rich high-caste households were more likely to rent out land and/or livestock, whereas land- and livestock-poor and credit constrained low-caste households were more likely to rent livestock and land from others. Participation in the two markets was positively correlated, indicating a synergistic relationship that may be due to production and transaction costs reducing benefits. Policies that can enhance the allocative efficiency of livestock and land rental markets can improve equity as well as efficiency of land use in Nepal. Provision of livestock credit to land-poor low-caste households is also crucially dependent on their access to more long-term contracts for land.

TI  - Does contract farming affect technical efficiency? Evidence from soybean farmers in Northern Ghana
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD ECONOMICS
AB  - Understanding how and the extent to which contract farming arrangements impact agricultural productivity is important to ensuring that policies are designed to maximize the likelihood of success. Using cross-sectional data from 516 soybean farmers in Northern Ghana, we provide empirical evidence that contract farming increases soybean productivity and technical efficiency in Northern Ghana. We use propensity score matching to reduce bias from observables, and then estimate a stochastic production frontier model that addresses selection bias arising from unobservable variables. We find that the technical efficiency levels of contract farmers are 77 percent compared with 69 percent for non-contract farmers. We also find that access to credit, extension contact, and farmer group membership are key determinants of participating in contract farming.

TI  - Change and diversity in smallholder rice-fish systems: Recent evidence and policy lessons from Bangladesh
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Efforts to unlock the genetic potential of both rice and fish, when combined with improvements in the management of rice-fish systems, can potentially increase agricultural productivity and food security in some of the poorest and most populous countries in Asia. In Bangladesh, estimates suggest that the country's potential rice-fish production system encompasses 2-3 million hectares of land. But despite three decades of research on biophysical and technical aspects of rice-fish systems, this potential has not been fully realized due to insufficient attention given to the social, economic, and policy dimensions of rice-fish system improvement. This paper provides a characterization of the diverse and changing nature of rice-fish systems in Bangladesh to shed new light on the economic viability of different rice-fish systems and recommend policy and investment options to accelerate the development of appropriate rice-fish technologies. Data are drawn from a novel subdistrict-level survey of fishery officers, a household/enterprise survey, focus group discussions, and a meta-review of the literature on aquaculture in the country, all of which were conducted in 2010-2011. Findings indicate that concurrent rice-fish systems, alternating rice-fish systems, and collectively managed systems offer considerable potential for increasing productivity and farm incomes in Bangladesh. Findings also suggest that while innovation in these rice-fish systems is being driven by households and communities, there is need for more supportive government policies and investments to enable further innovation. Policymakers need to develop effective regulations to promote feed and fish quality and quantity, for example. More rigorous analysis of the intended and unintended impacts of these policies and investments is also necessary. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The challenge of intermediary coordination in smallholder sugarcane production in Tanzania
T2  - JOURNAL OF MODERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - Orthodox approaches to development view the market as a key institution for driving economic transformation and for fostering innovation and competitiveness. The working of markets alone, however, does not always lead to improved outcomes such as increase in productivity or production efficiency in the context of smallholders. The role of non-market institutions, therefore, remains important. This paper examines the role of intermediary coordination in addressing constraints to efficiency and productivity of smallholder sugarcane producers in Tanzania. It also makes a contrastive analysis of a different organisational arrangement for smallholder sugarcane producers in Malawi. The key proposition is that while intermediary organisations of cane outgrowers in Tanzania have played a significant role in promoting effective market linkage, an increase in productivity required for competitiveness is limited by the lack of effective horizontal coordination.

TI  - Walk the Talk: Private Sustainability Standards in the Ugandan Coffee Sector
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - We investigate the welfare and productivity implications of private sustainability standards in the coffee sector in Uganda. We use cross-sectional household survey data and an instrumental variable method with instruments that pass weak identification and over-identification restrictions. We find that triple Utz-Rainforest Alliance-4C certification increases income, and land and labour productivity, and reduces poverty. Double Fairtrade-Organic certification is found to be associated with higher producer prices but results in lower land and labour productivity, and thereby fails to increase producer income and contribute to poverty reduction. We conclude that private sustainability standards do not always live up the expectations they create towards consumers.

TI  - Political economy, labor migration, and the AIDS epidemic in rural Malawi
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - This study examines how livelihood struggles push rural Malawians into AIDS-risky sexual behavior. The study involved in-depth interviews of 59 household guardians, four key informant group discussions, and after work observations and interviews of 19 people working, traveling, or running businesses. Findings reveal that circular migration has become a livelihood practice for adults aged 20-49 in rural Malawi through which they contract AIDS. This migration springs from the fragile political economy brought about by development strategies that did not build up and deploy human capital in rural communities. Doing so would advance local economic enterprise that would reduce prime age adults' involvement in circular migration and improve their opportunities for self-determination thus increasing the adoption of AIDS prevention interventions in rural Malawi. The abstinence, being faithful, and condom use (ABC) interventions in controlling AIDS need to be complemented by developing human capital and using it to unlock the economic growth and problem-solving potential in rural communities.

TI  - Neighborhood social change and perceptions of environmental degradation
T2  - POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - This paper investigates how changes in neighborhood facilities-new schools, health posts, bus services, mills, dairies, agricultural cooperatives, and other facilities-influence perceptions of environmental degradation. We use three types of data from a rural area in Nepal: (1) data on changing neighborhood facilities from 171 neighborhoods, collected using ethnographic, survey, and archival methods; (2) survey data on household characteristics and environmental perceptions from 1,651 households; and (3) individual-level survey data. We find that new neighborhood facilities are associated with perceptions of environmental degradation. This is important because perceptions may indicate objective environmental degradation, encourage participation in programs to improve the environmental, and influence environmental behavior.

TI  - Improving opportunities for smallholder timber planters in Vietnam to benefit from domestic wood processing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - Since 1992, the Vietnamese Government has implemented far reaching policies and programs to increase the country's tree cover by promoting plantation forestry. In addition to providing environmental services, these efforts are intended to alleviate rural poverty through sustainable forestry. Towards this goal, more than 4 million ha have been assigned to households and rural cooperatives through forestland reallocation or management contracts. Although the extent of primary forest has continued to decrease, overall tree cover has increased by 47% since 1990, largely due to the spread of tree plantations. Meanwhile, in the last decade, with Vietnam's economic liberalisation policies, the timber processing industry has shifted from State-owned enterprises to private companies. By 2008, the processing sector had expanded into a $3 billion industry, one of Vietnam's top live export sectors and a major source of demand for logs and sawnwood.
   In 2010, an assessment in the industrial wood processing center of Binh Dinh province was conducted to gain insights on market opportunities for smallholder produced timber. The assessment revealed a number factors preventing local smallholders from fully capitalising on demand for wood from the processing industry. These included competition between the manufacturing sectors (e.g. furniture, woodchips and pulp industries), which creates an incentive for premature timber harvesting, and a lack of domestic supply of certified timber, resulting in Vietnam's furniture companies importing raw materials. To address the former, better segmentation of the wood production for the different sectors is recommended. The latter might be addressed through more aggressive efforts to certify household-scale timber plantations through simplified schemes such as the Forest Stewardship Council's Small and Low Intensity Managed Forests (SLIMF) certification, pending additional research to better understand the potential costs, benefits and risks of such a strategy.

TI  - Socio-economic drivers of improved sweet potato varieties adoption among smallholder farmers in South-Kivu Province, DR Congo
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB  - Promotion of improved crop varieties is an effective means of increasing farm productivity and alleviating poverty in rural areas. A successful dissemination of such varieties requires a deep understanding of target farmers' attitudes, preferences and socio-economic status. This study aimed at assessing factors linked to smallholder farmers' adoption decision for improved sweet potato varieties (ISPVs) in South-Kivu. A household survey was conducted on 360 smallholder farmers from four South-Kivu territories, in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), including Idjwi, Kabare, Kalehe and Walungu, and data were analyzed using a logit regression model. The adoption decision was negatively affected by farmers' age and the field-to-house distance. In contrast, the ISPVs adoption was favored by farmers' education level, reduced farm size, off-farm incomes, high monthly income and use of hired farm labor. Besides, farmers' cooperative membership, access to credit and planting materials, and contacts with extension services were instrumental in adopting improved sweet potato varieties in South-Kivu. This study highlighted the need to strengthen extension services, seed delivery systems, and amending the credit systems for increased impact on improved varieties adoption among South-Kivu sweet potato farmers.

TI  - Farmers coping strategies for climate shock: Is it differentiated by gender?
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Several studies have recognized that the agriculture sector is one of the major contributor to climate change, as well as largely affected adversely by climate change. Agricultural productivity is known to be sensitive to climate change induced effects and it has impact on livelihood of families linked with farming. Thus it is important to understand what are the existing coping strategies that farmer deploy in case of climate shocks like flood and drought and who is involved in making decision relating to these coping strategies. This paper uses the household level data of 641 households from 12 randomly selected villages in Vaishali district of Bihar to understand the household coping mechanisms with emphasis on role of gender. This study has moved away from the conventional division of households by male and female-headed households and thus capturing the intra-household gender dynamics by understanding the role of men and women within the household as decision makers of the coping strategy to manage climate shock. The study uses a multivariate probit model and the results suggest that there is a higher probability that the male farmers will make the decision on choice of the coping strategy. The most prominent coping mechanism is to find alternative employment in urban locations; however, when consumption levels have to be reduced because of climate shock, all family members then contribute to the decision-making process collectively. The results show that exposure to agriculture extension and training programs have a positive influence on choosing appropriate coping mechanisms, but female farmers have poor access to these resources. These policies should look into providing outreach to both male and female farmers in any given locality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Misidentification by farmers of the crop varieties they grow: Lessons from DNA fingerprinting of wheat in Ethiopia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Accurate identification of crop varieties grown by farmers is crucial, among others, for crop management, food security and varietal development and dissemination purposes. One may expect varietal identification to be more challenging in the context of developing countries where literacy and education are limited and informal seed systems and seed recycling are common. This paper evaluates the extent to which smallholder farmers misidentify their wheat varieties in Ethiopia and explores the associated factors and their implications. The study uses data from a nationally representative wheat growing sample household survey and DNA fingerprinting of seed samples from 3,884 wheat plots in major wheat growing zones of Ethiopia. 28-34% of the farmers correctly identified their wheat varieties. Correct identification was positively associated with farmer education and seed purchases from trusted sources (cooperatives or known farmers) and negatively associated with seed recycling. Farmers' varietal identification thereby is problematic and leads to erroneous results in adoption and impact assessments. DNA fingerprinting can enhance varietal identification but remains mute in the identification of contextual and explanatory factors. Thus, combining household survey and DNA fingerprinting approaches is needed for reliable varietal adoption and impact assessments, and generate useful knowledge to inform policy recommendations related to varietal replacement and seed systems development.

TI  - The impact of social insurance on health among middle-aged and older adults in rural China: a longitudinal study using a three-wave nationwide survey
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundMany studies have examined the impact of social insurance on health, but the results have generally been mixed, presumably because they have not fully addressed potential biases related to the study's cross-sectional design. In this study, we conducted a longitudinal analysis to investigate how participation in two social insurance programs in China-the New Rural Social Pension Insurance (NRSPI) and the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS)-was associated with health outcomes among middle-aged and older adults in rural China.MethodsUsing three-wave longitudinal data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study conducted in 2011, 2013, and 2015, we estimated the dynamic fixed-effects regression models to examine the association between participation in the NRCMS/NRSPI and six types of health outcomes.ResultsParticipation in the NRSPI was positively associated with some health outcomes, but the associations were relatively modest and were observed only for some specific age and household income groups. Participation in NRCMS was not associated with any health outcomes.ConclusionsThe results provide limited evidence of the positive impact of social insurance on health among middle-aged and older adults in rural China. Thus, social insurance programs should be reformed to enhance their positive impact on health.

TI  - Factors affecting agricultural land transfer-out in China: a semiparametric instrumental variable model
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB  - This paper uses a semiparametric instrumental variable model to study the determinants of agricultural land transfer-out, using face-to-face survey data collected in 2014 from 2,677 farmers in nine provinces of China. Results show that variables, such as the number of parcels of land, the collective's total land transfer-out, and the availability of a transportation network, have significant linear positive effects on households' farmland transfer-out. Having family members with a lower educational level affect land transfer-out negatively. Landholding size and land idling have an inverted-U and L shaped impact, respectively, on land transfer-out. Results also indicate that agricultural income ratio has an overall negative influence on land transfer out. Land transfer-out has the potential to provide opportunities to earn additional income from the land, increase land productivity, and reduce poverty in rural China.

TI  - Hungry Birds and Angry Farmers: Using Choice Experiments to Assess "Eco-compensation" for Coastal Wetlands Protection in China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - The JYNNR - a Ramsar Site, Biosphere Reserve and important wintering ground for 15-18% of the world's Red Crowned Cranes - faces major pressure from regional development. This paper uses choice experiments to assess farmer preferences for an "eco-compensation" program targeting pesticide use by rural communities in and near the Jiangsu-Yancheng Coastal Wetlands Rare Birds National Nature Reserve (JYNNR). "Eco-compensation" is a China-specific term encompassing many incentive-based environmental management approaches. To identify options to reconcile rural welfare improvement with conservation, data was collected from 311 rural households in and near the JYNNR assessing perceptions of the JYNNR, wetland birds, use and impact of pesticides, and preferences for contracts to mitigate pesticide impacts. Results suggest that conflict with the JYNNR is growing, and that pesticide management could be an effective entry-point for engagement. The analysis finds several options for cost-effective contracts: granting rights to leave the program without penalty and increasing share of household land enrolled significantly reduce willingness-to-accept-payment (WTA), while longer contracts and larger reductions in pesticide use increase WTA, which interact meaningfully with farmer characteristics. Providing communities with training and technical support on proper pesticide use could, under specific contract structures, be sufficient to induce 100% enrollment without subsidies.

TI  - Drivers Behind Farmers' Willingness to Terminate Arable Land Use Contracts
T2  - TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR ECONOMISCHE EN SOCIALE GEOGRAFIE
AB  - The shortage of land resources has become a serious problem in China's rapid urbanisation. A recognised method for solving arable land resource shortage problems is to encourage marginal farmers to terminate their arable land use contracts with the government so that they can be transferred to farmers with better prospects. This paper analyses the drivers behind farmers' willingness to terminate their arable land use contracts based on survey data from agricultural households in Guanzhong, Shaanxi Province, China, using a multivariable logistic model. Results show that households led by male householders, with large families, fewer agricultural labourers, more plots of land, including family members with non-agricultural skills training and including family members who are covered by rural residents' health insurance, are more likely to terminate their contracts.

TI  - The significance of dry forest income for livelihood resilience: The case of the pastoralists and agro-pastoralists in the drylands of southeastern Ethiopia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - There is a growing interest to take into account dry forests in planning sustainable development in arid and semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa. A mixed quantitative and qualitative research design involving various data collection tools was employed to examine the significance of dry forest income and associated conditioning factors in the context of pastoral and agro-pastoral production systems of southeastern Ethiopia. Income from livestock and dry forests were the first and second most important components of the total household income. Dry forest income accounts 34.8% and 35.2% of the total household income and 38% and 46% of the total household cash income in the Liben and Afdher Administrative Zones of Somali National Regional State, respectively. It was the largest income compared to all other incomes added together for 45% of the respondents. Most notably, for very poor households, dry forest income contributes up to 63% of their total income. Dry forest income levels varied significantly with occupation (P < 0.05), pastoralists generating more income than agro-pastoralists. Dry forest income enables 24% of households to remain above the poverty line, and it reduces income disparity by 13.7%. Moreover, dry forest income has become increasingly important for households' ex-ante risk and ex-post drought coping strategies. The number of youths per household (P < 0.001), access to extension services (P < 0.001), and being member of a cooperative (P < 0.05) significantly affected dry forest income levels in both Zones. Findings of this study could apply to similar dryland eco-regions in the Horn of Africa and contribute to enhance promotion of sustainable management of dry forests for integrated livelihood adaptation, biodiversity conservation and combating desertification. Further research is needed to quantify the contribution dry forests make to livelihoods through livestock production and to develop options that will guide policy making process to generate additional economic incentives for communities and countries to be engaged in sustainable management and use of dry forests.

TI  - Learning to eat from others: Does nutritional information acquired from peers affect nutrition intake?
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Rural communities in low-and middle-income countries are vulnerable to malnutrition. They also tend to have strong social ties, exhibit high social connectedness, and lean on relatives, neighbors, and friends for support and information. Accordingly, focusing on the three macronutrients (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) and three critical micronutrients (iron, zinc, and selenium), we analyze the effects of nutritional information acquired from relatives, neighbors, and friends on rural households' nutrition intake. We utilize propensity score matching to analyze cross-sectional data collected from 915 rural households in China. Results show that acquiring nutri-tional information significantly improves households' intake of fats, iron, and selenium but does not affect the intake of proteins, carbohydrates, and zinc. The disaggregated analysis reveals that the nutrition intake of fe-males responds to nutritional information, but that of males does not. Also, large households' nutrition intake increases in response to nutritional information, whereas that of small households is mostly unaffected. The results suggest that people assimilate new ideas to improve their dietary habits. However, by the same token, they may be susceptible to the deleterious effects of nutritional misinformation and fads. Policymakers, not -for-profit organizations, and industry stakeholders should disseminate evidence-based nutritional information to foster health and wellbeing in rural areas.

TI  - Market Outlet Choice and Its Effects on the Welfare of Smallholder Vegetable and Fruit Producers in Ethiopia
T2  - HORTICULTURAE
AB  - The decision to choose an appropriate market outlet may involve a self-selection problem. This suggests that unobservable characteristics play an important role, and the examination of the impact of market outlet choice on smallholder household welfare needs to correct this selection bias. Consequently, this study, by using a multinomial endogenous treatment model, examined the determinants of market outlet choices and their subsequent effects on the welfare of smallholder vegetable and fruit producers in Ethiopia. The results on the determinants of market outlet choices obtained using this model indicated that distance to main roads, livestock ownership, access to extension, and cooperative membership influenced the decisions of smallholder farmers in one way or another. Furthermore, the model results obtained by correcting the selectivity indicated that, relative to formal markets, informal markets have a low impact on the welfare of smallholder farmers. Thus, alternative policy measurements aimed at improving the food security and welfare of smallholder farmers should be accompanied by improving their access to formal markets.

TI  - Farmers' credit access in the Democratic Republic of Congo: Empirical evidence from youth tomato farmers in Ruzizi plain in South Kivu
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This article assesses the opinions of youth tomato growers on the accessibility of agricultural credit and factors that influence the accessibility in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Data originated from a household survey for the 2019/2020 farming season. We interviewed 218 youth tomato growers from 6 horticulture production zones in the South-Kivu, eastern DRC. The result reveals a low rate of 20.6% on accessing agricultural credit among tomato growers. The topmost nature of agricultural credit received was cash-based, mostly from informal sources of finance (92.7%). The findings reveal that the lack of information on agricultural credit, the fear of credit default, and the absence of Microfinance Institutions in the study areas were the highest-ranking factors hindering tomato growers from accessing agricultural credit services. Our probit model shows that total household income, gender, and tomato growers' membership in a cooperative were essential factors that explain the probability of accessing agricultural credit. We recommend formalising the agricultural credit system by improving agri-finance extension service delivery to associations of tomato growers among the young to access and use agricultural microcredit services effectively to enhance agricultural production, which is a proxy for rural employment creation and poverty reduction.

TI  - Influence of social capital on the livelihood strategies of farmers under China's rural revitalization strategy in poor mountain areas: A case study of the Liangshan Yi autonomous prefecture
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
AB  - Social capital in the form of social resources or social networks is one of the most important livelihood capital of farmers, which can increase the labor productivity of poor households and increase income. It is important to explore the reasons underlying the livelihood strategy choices of farmers from the perspective of social capital under China's rural revitalization strategy. In this study, the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, a poverty-stricken mountainous area in southwestern China, was selected as the case study area, and multivariable linear regression models were constructed to analyze the influence of social capital on livelihood strategies. The results are as follows: (1) Individual social capital had a positive effect on non-agricultural livelihood strategies. On average, with a one-unit increase in individual social capital, the ratio of farmers' non-agricultural income to total productive income (Income_Rto) increased by 0.002% and 0.062%, respectively. Collective social capital, with the Peasant Economic Cooperation Organization (PECO) as the carrier, had a negative effect on the non-agricultural livelihood strategies of farmers; on average, with a one-unit increase in PECO, Income_Rto decreased by approximately 0.053%. However, this effect was only significant in the river valley area. (2) The income differences among the different livelihood strategy types were explained by the livelihood strategy choices of farmers. As non-agricultural work can bring more benefits, the labor force exhibited one-way migration from villages to cities, resulting in a lack of the subject of rural revitalization. It is necessary to implement effective measures to highlight the role of PECO in increasing agricultural income for farmers. Finally, based on the above conclusions, policy recommendations with respect to livelihood transformation of farmers and rural sustainable development are discussed.

TI  - Human wellbeing outcomes of involvement in industrial crop production: Evidence from sugarcane, oil palm and jatropha sites in Ghana
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - An extensive body of theoretical work has advocated the use of multiple human wellbeing indicators to assess the outcomes of agricultural investments in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). However, few studies have actually achieved it. This study investigates the human wellbeing outcomes of involvement in industrial crop production in Ghana by comparing the levels of different objective and subjective wellbeing measures for groups involved in industrial crop production as plantation workers and smallholders, and groups not involved (i. e. control groups). We use household income, adult consumption and the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) as indicators of objective wellbeing. We measure subjective wellbeing through self-reported levels of satisfaction with life, worthwhileness, happiness and anxiousness. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) analysis is used to assess whether involvement in industrial crop production increases household income and consumption. Overall, for most indicators of objective wellbeing industrial crop outgrowers, smallholders and independent smallholders are better off compared to other groups in their respective sites (in terms of mean scores), but involvement does not necessarily brings human wellbeing benefits (PSM analysis). On the other hand plantation workers are either worse off or have similar level of objective human wellbeing with control groups in their respective sites (in terms of mean scores), but involvement sometimes brings human wellbeing benefits (PSM analysis). However, workers tend to benefit from access to plantation infrastructure, which has a positive effect to their multi-dimensional poverty. In most cases the objective wellbeing measures do not correlate well with self-reported levels of subjective wellbeing. It is important to combine such indicators when evaluating the human wellbeing outcomes of agricultural investments in order to obtain a more comprehensive outlook of whether industrial crop production can become a valuable rural development strategy in SSA.

TI  - How can sedentarised pastoralists be more technically efficient? A case from eastern Inner Mongolia
T2  - RANGELAND JOURNAL
AB  - Technical efficiency (TE) means the effectiveness of production outputs attained for a given level of production inputs. This study examines pastoralist TE and its determinants for 416 pastoralist households from two leagues (prefectures) in eastern Inner Mongolia, a typical rangeland area in China. A one-step stochastic frontier method is applied to analyse data about household livestock production in 2011 to assess opportunities for increasing income and reducing poverty through increased TE. The main results show that pastoralists, in general, did not perform well with currently available technology, with the average TE score just 0.50 out of 1.0. Only about one-fifth (20.2%) of respondents had TE scores >0.7, and the same proportion had a TE score <0.3. More than one-quarter had TE scores in the range 0.3-0.5, and slightly more than one-third had TE scores in the range 0.5-0.7. About 83% of the variation in pastoralist livestock production is explained by the loss of TE. The age of the head of household, available pasture, investment in covered pens and participation in the rangeland rental market were found to influence TE. Encouraging younger pastoralists to enter pastoralism, and enlarging available grazing land through the rangeland rental market or cooperative rangeland use would likely enhance pastoralist performance; promoting investment in covered-pen construction could also improve productivity and alleviate a rangeland degradation cycle, which is pervasive in the study area.

TI  - Social capital, trust, and adaptation to climate change: Evidence from rural Ethiopia
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Climate change is expected to have particularly severe effects on poor agrarian populations. Rural households in developing countries adapt to the risks and impacts of climate change both individually and collectively. Empirical research has shown that access to capital financial, human, physical, and social is critical for building resilience and fostering adaptation to environmental stresses. Little attention, however, has been paid to how social capital generally might facilitate adaptation through trust and cooperation, particularly among rural households and communities. This paper addresses the question of how social capital affects adaptation to climate change by rural households by focusing on the relationship of household and collective adaptation behaviors. A mixed-methods approach allows us to better account for the complexity of social institutions at the household, community, and government levels which drive climate adaptation outcomes. We use data from interviews, household surveys, and field experiments conducted in 20 communities with 400 households in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Our results suggest that qualitative measures of trust predict contributions to public goods, a result that is consistent with the theorized role of social capital in collective action. Yet qualitative trust is negatively related to private household-level adaptation behaviors, which raises the possibility that social capital may, paradoxically, be detrimental to private adaptation. Policymakers should account for the potential difference in public and private adaptation behaviors in relation to trust and social capital when designing interventions for climate adaptation.

TI  - Loose fruit mamas: Creating incentives for smallholder women in oil palm production in Papua New Guinea
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This paper presents a case study of the introduction of a more gender equitable payment scheme for oil palm smallholders in Papua New Guinea. Women are now paid separately from their husbands for their work on family oil palm plots thereby increasing the economic incentives for women to commit labor to oil palm production. The study incorporates broader local cultural and economic processes in the analysis of intra-household gender and labor relations to explain how the new payment systems successfully resolved intra-household disputes over labor and income. The paper highlights the critical role export firms can play in enhancing women's access to commodity crop income. Further, the paper demonstrates that by widening the framework of household analysis, insights can be gained into two key questions that have received only limited attention in the literature: the question of why men do not share a greater proportion of cash crop income with other family members; and, the apparent inability of families to resolve intra-household conflicts over income.

TI  - Effect of community-based behaviour change management on neonatal mortality in Shivgarh, Uttar Pradesh, India: a cluster-randomised controlled trial
T2  - LANCET
AB  - Background In rural India, most births take place in the home, where high-risk care practices are common. We developed an intervention of behaviour change management, with a focus on prevention of hypothermia, aimed at modifying practices and reducing neonatal mortality.
   Methods We did a cluster-randomised controlled efficacy trial in Shivgarh, a rural area in Uttar Pradesh. 39 village administrative units (population 104123) were allocated to one of three groups: a control group, which received the usual services of governmental and non-governmental organisations in the area; an intervention group, which received a preventive package of interventions for essential newborn care (birth preparedness, clean delivery and cord care, thermal care [including skin-to-skin care], breastfeeding promotion, and danger sign recognition); or another intervention group, which received the package of essential newborn care plus use of a liquid crystal hypothermia indicator (ThermoSpot). In the intervention clusters, community health workers delivered the packages via collective meetings and two antenatal and two postnatal household visitations. Outcome measures included changes in newborn-care practices and neonatal mortality rate compared with the control group. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as International Standard Randomised Control Trial, number NCT00198653.
   Findings Improvements in birth preparedness, hygienic delivery, thermal care (including skin-to-skin care), umbilical cord care, skin care, and breastfeeding were seen in intervention arms. There was little change in care-seeking. Compared with controls, neonatal mortality rate was reduced by 54% in the essential newborn-care intervention (rate ratio 0 . 46 [95% CI 0 . 35-0.60], p<0 . 0001) and by 52% in the essential newborn care plus ThermoSpot arm (0.48 [95% Cl 0 . 35-0.66], p<0 . 0001).
   Interpretation A socioculturally contextualised, community-based intervention, targeted at high-risk newborn-care practices, can lead to substantial behavioural modification and reduction in neonatal mortality. This approach can be applied to behaviour change along the continuum of care, harmonise vertical interventions, and build community capacity for sustained development.

TI  - What Drives Smallholders to Utilize Socialized Agricultural Services for Farmland Scale Management? Insights from the Perspective of Collective Action
T2  - LAND
AB  - The diseconomies of scale found in smallholders' agricultural production is a common problem faced by global agricultural development. Notable examples of regions in which this occurs include Central and Eastern Europe, India, Brazil, and China. Smallholders usually differ in their demands for socialized agricultural services due to scattered farmland, various soil conditions, different selections of crop varieties, and diverse farming arrangements. Such differences make it difficult for smallholders to cooperate on farmland scale management, resulting in a collective action dilemma. Based on the Institutional Analysis and Development framework, this paper provides insights into the influencing factors and effects of smallholders' utilization of socialized agricultural services and constructs a cooperative mechanism for the purpose of solving the collective action dilemma in rural areas of China. We found that household characteristics, biophysical conditions, attributes of community, and rules-in-use jointly generate the action situation in the process of smallholders' cooperative utilization of agricultural socialized services. Among them, the rules-in-use not only have a direct impact on the action situation but also regulate the role of the other three sets of factors. Various factors and mechanisms affecting the cooperative utilization of socialized agricultural services by smallholders interact in the action arena and finally form relevant outcomes that can deal with the diseconomies of farmland fragmentation. These outcomes will be fed back to each external variable again along the feedback path, so as to promote the system and create a virtuous circle. This study provides a theoretical contribution to understanding smallholders' cooperation in the process of agricultural large-scale operation, especially in regions and countries with a large number of smallholders.

TI  - Livelihood Capitals, Income Inequality, and the Perception of Climate Change: A Case Study of Small-Scale Cattle Farmers in the Ecuadorian Andes
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of 2015 identify poverty, growth, and inequality as three key areas of intervention towards the UN 2030 Agenda for human well-being and sustainability. Herein, the predominant objectives are: (a) To determine the poverty groups by quintiles through the cattle income in households of small milk producers; (b) To characterize rural livelihoods by using capital theory; and (c) To assess the perception of climate change (CC) and the willingness to accept adaptation as well as mitigation measures. The current study was performed in communities that are located in the Ecuadorian Andes, where some 178 surveys were conducted with indigenous Kichwa and mestizo heads of households. From the total net income determined, five groups were organized. The Lorenz curve was applied as a general indicator of the relative inequality, as well as the Gini coefficient (G). On the basis of the theory of capital, the human, social, natural, physical, and financial characteristics were determined, and seven variables were considered to evaluate the perception and willingness to accept mitigation and adaptation actions of the given quintiles. The result of the Gini coefficient was 0.52, which indicates that the poorest 20% of the population only receives 3.40% of the income, while the richest 20% of the quintile obtain about 54% of the total income. It is evident that most producers know little about CC, but that they are willing to receive strengthening programs. Therefore, it is essential to establish strategic guidelines from public policy in order to reduce inequality and to improve the social welfare of producers, with a transversal axis in the strengthening of the capacities on the impact, mitigation, and adaptation to CC, as well as the provision of several tools, such as access to climate information.

TI  - One size fits all? Contract farming among broiler producers in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB  - Contract farming has been increasingly found to benefit smallholders in developing countries, yet much less is known about its role in the poultry industry where economies of scale could be more prominent. This study aims to narrow this gap by analysing the choice of contract farming among Chinese broiler producers using a nationally representative survey. Simply cost-benefit analysis and multinomial logit regression modelling are jointly employed to explain contract farming decision making especially among small producers. In contrast to many recent studies, we find that small producers, though not passively excluded, usually opt out of contract farming due to limited profitability when large producers are coexistent. Such relationship is appropriately identified through a control function approach to correct for possible endogeneity. Therefore, contract farming may not help achieve higher welfare goals for small broiler producers who actually instead seek alternative market opportunities that better realise their comparative advantages.

TI  - Socio-economic and demographic factors influencing open defecation in Haiti: a cross-sectional study
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background Open defecation (OD) remains an important public health challenge in Haiti. The practice poses a significantly high risk of disease transmission. Considering these negative health consequences, this paper aims to identify socio-economic and demographic factors that influence OD practice among households in Haiti. Methods The study used secondary data from 13,405 households from the Haiti Demographic and Health Survey 2016-2017. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis were used to find the preliminary results. Further, multivariate analysis was performed to confirm the findings. Results Around one quarter (25.3%) of Haitian households still defecate in the open, almost 10% in urban areas, and nearly 36% in rural areas. Multivariate analysis revealed that the age and sex of the household head, household size, number of children aged 1-14 years old in the household, education level, wealth index, access to mass media, place of residence, and region were significant predictors of OD practice among households in Haiti. Conclusion To accelerate the elimination of OD by 2030 and therefore achieve sustainable open defecation-free status, the government of Haiti and its partners should consider wealth disparities among regions and mobilize mass media and community-based networks to raise awareness and promote education about sane sanitation practices. Furthermore, because the possibilities to build toilets differ between rural and urban areas, specific interventions must be spearheaded for each of these regions. The public program can subsidize individual toilets in rural areas with room to collect dry excreta for the preparation of fertilizers, while in urban areas collective toilets can be built in slums. Interventions should also prioritize households headed by women and young people, two underpriviledged socioeconomic groups in Haiti.

TI  - A Study on Risk-Sharing Scheme of Formal Contract Agreements in Swine Industry in Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
AB  - Although Vietnam is ranked as the world's largest pig producers and the global pork consumption country, its swine and pork industry have been at the beginning of modernization. Swine producers, which dominate by small-scale farmers, are suffering from a number of risks. Participation in formal contract farming is one of the mitigation strategies. This study aims at summarizing the main risks of different scales pig farmers and analyzing how they have been overcome insights the contract agreements. Through the review of previous works, using time series database and in depth-interviews, results have been found as follows. Contract agreements in swine sector are the applications of ones in developed countries, which have been amended to fit Vietnam's circumstance. Production management and marketing contracts have specific terms to share almost staple risks of independent small-scale producers like the price of hog and animal feed, utilization of breeds, feeding, and related technical production. It prevents the systematic risk of epidemic diseases through bio-control solutions of the large- and mega-farms. Marketing contract brings benefit for processors in terms of cost reduction by ensuring steady large flows of uniform live hog inputted. The majeure case is identified, although it is the un-specific rule. Contract agreement retains its limitation, as a non-market instrument, in mitigating with correlated risks. It cannot cover systematic effect to contractors like epidemic diseases, variation in the domestic hog price, the volatility of international market price of staple materials for animal feed production and/or the compound-risks created by the combination of those. However, this scheme is considered as an essential instrument for risk mitigation given the fact that agricultural insurance, future contract, options, or other financial tools do not exist in Vietnam. The contract agreement, vertical integration or coordination are the ways to boost the development of swine industry in the developing countries.

TI  - HOW TENURE SECURITY AND FARMLAND TRANSFER AFFECTED FARMLAND INVESTMENT: EVIDENCE FROM APPLE GROWERS IN CHINA
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMY
AB  - Tenure insecurity and thin land rental markets weakened the incentives to farmland investment in rural China, which was not conducive to improving agricultural productivity. Thus, impacts of tenure security and farmland transfer on farmland investment were analyzed by using the household fixed effect model, the IV method and a 762 household-level and 1163 plot-level data set. The results indicated that: (1) compared with owned plots, the number of farmyard manure in rented plots without stipulating rental time was significantly decreased by 64.0 similar to 66.9%; (2) each 1% increase in land rents led to a 1.7% rise in the input of farmyard manure; (3) each 1% increase in the size of farmland transfer resulted in a 0.1% rise in the input of farmyard manure. Our study contributed to boosting agricultural sustainable development from the perspectives of improving the systems of farmland property rights and developing farmland rental markets.

TI  - Do farmer groups impact on farm yield and efficiency of smallholder farmers? Evidence from rice farmers in northern Ghana
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Multiple production and marketing challenges facing smallholder farmers in developing countries have resulted in renewed interests of governments, donor agencies and private agribusiness companies in forming farmer groups to help address these challenges. Using recent survey data of 412 smallholder rice farmers from northern Ghana, we examine the role of farmer groups in improving yield and technical efficiency. Due to self-selection into farmer groups, we use a sample selection stochastic production frontier model to account for potential selection bias arising from observed and unobserved attributes. The empirical results reveal that participation in farmer groups is associated with increased yield and technical efficiency, relative to farmers who produce and market rice individually. Moreover, the yield and efficiency gaps between group members and nonmembers increase significantly when selection bias is taken into account in the analysis.

TI  - Macroeconomic and distributional impacts of exchange rate devaluation in Ethiopia: A computable general equilibrium approach
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - In this paper, we simulate the macroeconomic and distributional impacts of exchange rate devaluation in Ethiopia using a dynamic single country Computable General Equilibrium model. We find that although devaluation helps exports to be more competitive in the short term, thereby increasing export earnings, over the long term the policy is found to have a contractionary and inflationary impact in a developing country like Ethiopia. It also comes at the cost of a reduction in household welfare and investment. In terms of distributional impact, the policy simulation result suggests that devaluation disproportionately affects urban households than rural households in Ethiopia given the nature of their consumption basket.

TI  - Empirical modelisation of socio-economic determinants in smallholder farming management in southwest of Burkina Faso
T2  - BIOTECHNOLOGIE AGRONOMIE SOCIETE ET ENVIRONNEMENT
AB  - The study aims at identifying farmer's decision rules and the socio-economic determinants of organic resource dynamics. Decision rules study and socio-economic determinants of organic resource dynamics allowed quantification of their impact on these organic resource dynamics. The main results of the investigations reveal that principal decision rules are edicted and managed by local authorities. These decision rules concern collective management and access to the cultivated land, grazing land, and homestead and to the bush. Farmers have also a diversity of individual rules covering production, consumption, marketing and relations between themselves. Survey of a sample of one hundred farmers selected for their representativity allowed to quantify relations between farm needs and their organic resource use. These relations permitted developing empirical statistical models
   (needs of land to cultivate, food grains needs, cash needs, fuel wood needs) depending on farming system. Fuel wood needs were established with survey measured data. These needs expressed in kilogramme consumed wood per person and per day were established for the dry season (0.97 kg per person and per day) and for the wet season (1.36 kg per person and per day).
   Average fuel wood consumption by person per day has an exponential decay when the household size increases. When land is available, land need for cultivation mainly depends on labour availability. Food grain needs is constant (180 kg per person and per year). It is the same in both farming systems studied. Money needs depend on cash crop surfaces, livestock's products and extra agricultural activities of the farmer.

TI  - Conflict, fraud, and distrust in Ethiopian agricultural cooperatives
T2  - JOURNAL OF CO-OPERATIVE ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Agricultural cooperatives are seen as an efficient way for smallholder farmers to create bargaining power in order to achieve poverty reduction and food security. However, the success of these cooperatives depends on their ability to maintain their social capital, which is at the core of collective action. A few studies have addressed issues of member participation, commitment, and trust, yet less is known about rural cooperatives in developing countries as a social organization. It is also unclear whether a relationship exists between cooperative size and the incidence of conflict, fraud, and distrust. Using unique data collected from 511 agricultural cooperatives in 12 districts of Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, this paper examines the effects of cooperative size on conflict, fraud, and distrust. We used instrumental variables (IV) probit estimation techniques, accounting for endogeneity of membership size, to confirm that cooperative size does affect the occurrence of conflict, fraud, and trust. The results also indicate that other influencing factors include: cooperative age, number of employees, payment of dividends based on transaction volume, and heterogeneity of member goals.

TI  - Empirical Study on the Effects of Technology Training on the Forest-Related Income of Rural Poverty-Stricken Households-Based on the PSM Method
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The implementation of technology training is essential to promote the commercialization of research achievements, and plays a crucial role in poverty alleviation in China. Based on the microcosmic survey data of farmers in four poverty-stricken counties officially assisted by National Forestry and Grassland Administration, the effects of technology training on forest-related income of rural poverty-stricken households is analyzed by using Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method. The study found that after eliminating the deviation from the self-selection and the endogenous issues, the forestry technology training has increased the total forest-related family income and forestry production and operation income by 3.09 times and 2.82 times, respectively. The effect of technology training on income increase is remarkable. Besides, the behavior of poor farmers participating in forestry technology training is significantly affected by the following factors, such as gender, age, family size, managed forestland area, whether they held forest tenure/equity certificate, whether they joined forestry professional cooperatives, and whether they cooperated with forestry enterprises. In order to further improve the effect of technology in poverty alleviation, the following policy recommendations are proposed, including: (1) to encourage poverty-stricken households to actively participate in forestry technology training; (2) to establish a diversified system of forestry technology training; and (3) to ensure the training content is based on the actual needs of the poor.

TI  - The Economic Impact of Climate Change on Wheat and Maize Yields in the North China Plain
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Climate change has significantly affected agricultural production. As one of China's most important agricultural production regions, the North China Plain (NCP) is subject to climate change. This paper examines the influence of climate change on the wheat and maize yields at household and village levels, using the multilevel model based on a large panel survey dataset in the NCP. The results show that: (i) Extreme weather events (drought and flood) would significantly reduce the wheat and maize yields. So, the governments should establish and improve the emergency service system of disaster warning and encourage farmers to mitigate the adverse effects of disasters. (ii) Over the past three decades, the NCP has experienced climate change that affects its grain production. Therefore, it is imperative to build the farmers' adaptive capacity to climate change. (iii) Spatial variations in crop yield are significantly influenced by the household characteristics and the heterogeneity of village economic conditions. Therefore, in addition to promoting household production, it is necessary to strengthen and promote China's development of the rural collective economy, especially the construction of rural irrigation and drainage infrastructures.

TI  - National Wage Trends and Migration in a Chinese Village Economy: A Micro Level Modeling Approach Based on a Composite Utility Function
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - China's economy is experiencing a regime shift away from a fully elastic supply of labor from a large pool of rural surplus labor and toward a situation of increasing labor scarcity and rising wage rates. Moreover, faster wage increases in the regions of origin of many rural-urban migrants are likely to affect the dynamics of inter-regional migration. These wage trends have implications at the local level, in particular in a setting in which migration connects rural communities to the national labor market and in which migration is of high importance for the livelihoods of rural households. Taking a village perspective, this article develops a village computable general equilibrium model to study local impacts of current wage trends in China. As a central piece of the model, the role of access to migration for household livelihoods is recognized. Access to migration is linked to household demographics and included in the model through a composite utility function that captures household preferences and disutilities associated with alternative off-farm activities. Simulation results illustrate how households' utility considerations affect migration responses to national wage changes. Statements about possible impacts on village level labor supply, land use, and agricultural production are made. When migration wages and local off-farm wages are simulated to increase, an overall increase in household and village migration and a higher supply of labor to local off-farm labor markets is accompanied by a contraction of farm production. Although land is reallocated between households with different migration responses, total agricultural output declines.

TI  - A feminist political ecology of farm resource entitlements in Northern Ghana
T2  - GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE
AB  - With the unprecedented feminization of agriculture globally, literature has emerged over the past decade suggesting that gender equality in agriculture could be advanced if gaps in access to farm resources between women and men are reduced. This paper examines gendered farm resource entitlements in northern Ghana. Based mainly on six months of immersive qualitative research, this case study draws from and contributes to feminist political ecology scholarship (FPE) on smallholder farming and agricultural development. The analysis describes some of the intensifying gender and intersecting inequalities (e.g., gender and ethnicity) of land access related to development interventions aimed at commercializing farming. Gender disparities in access to agricultural extension, chemical fertilizers, agrochemicals, high yielding seed varieties, tractor services, credit packages and marketing contracts supported by the state, donors and NGOs are also found. FPE is useful for revealing how these gendered resource disparities are related to agricultural commercialization and increasingly erratic rainfall and aridity, making smallholders more vulnerable to land dispossession. Women's dependence on men to farm while operating under these changing economic and environmental conditions, coupled with their weaker entitlement rights to resources, threatens to push many, particularly ethnic minority women, out of farming altogether. The ways that intersecting identities shape access to land also complicates understandings of the role of community outsiders who are both the dispossessors of land and those who are intensely vulnerable to dispossession. While rural development studies generally consider women's farm resources compared to men's, this does little to explain the intensifying intersectional vulnerabilities.

TI  - The legacy of traditional rice cultivation by descendants of Indian contract laborers in Suriname
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
AB  - Background Some 35,000 indentured laborers from India were recruited to work on plantations in Suriname between 1868 and 1916. It is likely that most were familiar with farming before they were shipped to this former Dutch colony in the Caribbean. Around 1900, those who did not return received a piece of land where most of them started growing rice as a staple crop. Agronomists characterized their traditional landraces as inferior and infested with weedy rice and started to 'purify' these landraces. No research has been done on whether these ancient rice varieties still exist. We aimed to document the rice varieties (both landraces and more modern cultivars) grown currently or in the recent past by (descendants of) Hindustani smallholders in Suriname, their origin, morphological and agronomic characters, local uses and cultural and spiritual relevance. Given the rapid decline in small-scale rice cultivation in the past 40 years, we wanted to know why people continued or abandoned rice farming and what aspects of traditional practices still survived. Methods We interviewed 26 (former) small-scale Hindustani farmers and asked about the varieties they cultivated and traditional agricultural practices. We collected seed samples, local names and associated information, and compared these to information from agricultural reports from the colonial period. We also interviewed 11 Maroons, one Javanese farmer, and three persons of mixed ethnicity, who were somehow involved in the cultivation of East Indian rice varieties. Results and discussion Hindustani smallholders in Suriname largely lost their traditional rice landraces. Most of the interviewed farmers grew modern cultivars, developed after 2000. Some cultivars from the 1950s were still planted for fodder, but these were heavily mixed with weedy rice and other weeds. Maroon farmers in the interior, however, still actively cultivated varieties with names like 'coolie rice', which probably descend from landraces introduced by the Indian contract laborers, although this needs to be confirmed by molecular research. Although traditional cultivation practices seem to have been lost, smallholders still retain pleasant memories of the manual planting, harvesting, and processing of rice, as well as the gender-based practices and beliefs associated with the cultivation of the crop. The oral history of former rice farmers and traditional rice varieties (possibly obtained from Maroon fields) could play a role in museum settings as living vehicles for memories of the descendants of Asian contract labourers in Suriname and Guyana.

TI  - Conflicts Induced by Different Responses to Land Expropriation Among the Farmers Involved During Urbanization in China
T2  - JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION
AB  - Expropriation of collectively-owned land has become an important realistic path for achieving urban development and new urbanization in China considering the shortage of state-owned land. During this process, farmers involved in land expropriation are often in conflict with one another because of the asymmetry of their interests. Such conflicts have a considerable effect on social harmony and stability. However, few studies have investigated such conflict of interests between farmers. Therefore, this research analyzed game behavior for the conflict of interests among farmers. A two-dimensional symmetric evolutionary game model and a multiagent simulation experiment were used to explore the conflicts induced by the farmers' different responses to land expropriation. This research finds that the changing strategy choices of farmers in the evolutionary game on collectively owned land expropriation are the main reasons for the occurrence of villager' confrontations and "nail households". Results provide targeted policy recommendations for local governments to promote cooperation among farmers, thereby enhancing social harmony. The findings also serve as references for other countries and regions in dealing with intra-conflict of interests in land expropriation.

TI  - Biofuels, poverty, and growth: a computable general equilibrium analysis of Mozambique
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper assesses the implications of large-scale investments in biofuels for growth and income distribution. We find that biofuels investment enhances growth and poverty reduction despite some displacement of food crops by biofuels. Overall, the biofuel investment trajectory analyzed increases Mozambique's annual economic growth by 0.6 percentage points and reduces the incidence of poverty by about 6 percentage points over a 12-year phase-in period. Benefits depend on production technology. An outgrower approach to producing biofuels is more pro-poor, due to the greater use of unskilled labor and accrual of land rents to smallholders, compared with the more capital-intensive plantation approach. Moreover, the benefits of outgrower schemes are enhanced if they result in technology spillovers to other crops. These results should not be taken as a green light for unrestrained biofuels development. Rather, they indicate that a carefully designed and managed biofuels policy holds the potential for substantial gains.

TI  - Enacting peasant moral community economies for sustainable livelihoods: A case of women-led cooperatives in rural Mexico
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The Mexican state has promoted women's group-based income-generating projects for nearly three decades. Although most state-supported income-generating projects discontinue after external funding ends, some continue to operate. While existing studies have highlighted several reasons for dis-/continuation, none have focused on the role of moral obligations in shaping women's everyday livelihood practices and few have closely examined context dependent external factors. In order to provide more effective support for women's collective efforts to strengthen sustainable livelihoods, we developed the framework peasant moral community economies. This framework draws on that of household moral economy, community economies and peasant moral economy as informed by feminist scholars' recognition of gender as process. Through our framework we investigated how intra-group dynamics and groups' relationships within their members' households and communities in their own specific environments shape group operations through examination of three initially state-funded women only but now long-running women-led cooperatives in rural Hidalgo, Mexico. Data was collected through surveys, focus group discussions, and in-depth interviews with cooperative members, their families and community authorities supplemented by secondary literature review and observation. We found that context specific manifestations of reciprocity and the right to subsistence were common to both household and community arrangements. While context specific manifestations of these moral principles enabled new gendered subjectivities that contributed to gender transformations and livelihood production, we also found that the same principles reinforced female altruism and exacerbated women's time poverty. The framework of peasant moral community economies allowed us to see how both contradictory gender transformations and time poverty provided conditions that supported the durability of the cooperatives. We conclude that support for women's collective efforts for sustainable livelihoods may be more effective if we recognise how livelihoods are produced also outside the cooperative by paying particular attention to context specific contradictory gender and moral dimensions.

TI  - Connecting Public Policies for Family Farmers and Women's Empowerment: The Case of the Brazilian Semi-Arid
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The role played by women in worldwide food production and food security has reinvigorated debates about the recognition of women's rights in the rural sector regarding better working conditions and the reduction of gender inequalities. In the 1980s, the social movement in Brazil restructured the politics in the agrarian sector by integrating farmers' rights and women's demands. Against this background, the objective of this study is to analyze, through the actors' perspectives, whether and how the combination of public policies for family farmers affected the socio-economic and political empowerment of women. Our case study covers family farmers from traditional communities located in the Brazilian semi-arid. The results show that women achieved economic stability by participating in public food procurement programmes. In addition, access to cisterns released women from the daily work of collecting water. Women became more involved with political issues, increasing participation in institutions such as NGOs, associations and cooperatives. Among the negative aspects, the study found that the sexual division of labor increased within the household context, and, despite being fundamental for ensuring household food security, women still struggle to have access to the means of production.

TI  - A DEA-model evaluation of the efficiency of peasant household credit investigation system in rural credit cooperatives A positive research in Hubei Province, China
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose - As a major agricultural province in central China, Hubei Province mainly carries out the peasant household credit investigation system through rural credit cooperatives (RCCs). The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of the peasant household credit investigation system in Hubei RCCs and provide some evidence and ideas to the formulation of relevant policies.
   Design/methodology/approach - First, this paper briefly reviews the related literature of the efficiency in credit investigation system; second, the paper gives a brief description of the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and designs the indicators for efficiency evaluation; third, the paper accounts data sources and processing methods; and finally, the paper performs the empirical analysis and draws a conclusion.
   Findings - The paper finds that the efficiency of the resource allocation in both regions is unoptimistic, the general efficiency is somewhat low, and it shows the trend of declination. The efficiency of pure technology in two regions represents the adverse trend. Every year's average scale efficiency in both regions is higher than the pure technology efficiency.
   Originality/value - The main contributions of this paper include the first use of DEA model to practically evaluate the efficiency of credit investigation system based on 54 samples of RCCs in Hubei Province and the horizontal and vertical comparisons of the results. The conclusions of this paper not only make the efficiency of credit investigation system in the province's 54 credit cooperatives comparable but also has a great application value to the. actual decision-making departments in formulating credit policies, and each credit cooperative in further building the credit investigation system according to its own conditions. Moreover, it has certain reference value to other similar studies.

TI  - Vietnam's forest cover changes 2005-2016: Veering from transition to (yet more) transaction?
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - In Vietnam, rapid deforestation until the 1980s was followed by a period of widespread reforestation. Acclaimed as the first 'forest transition' in Southeast Asia, this turn-around resulted from major environmental/socio-economic policy changes (notably land titling), successes in agriculture and plantation forestry, and state-led efforts in upland forest protection/restoration. We investigated forest trends after new shifts in forest governance towards more commodity/production orientation, underlining that recent advances are not irreversible. Using official provincial data and applying multivariate statistics, we elicited major factors influencing cover changes of two types of 'physical forests' ('natural forests' and exotic-species 'planted forests'), in relation with changes in 'political forestlands' of contrasting types (lands designated either for forest 'protection' or for wood 'production'), comparing periods before (2005-2010) and after (2011-2016) the introduction of Payments for Forest Ecosystem Services (PFES) policies. We find that a 'forest transition' only continues if the tree plantation boom (now reaching remote/marginal/poor upland provinces) is factored into 'forest change'. Country-wide natural forest cover decreased slightly since 2006, with however regionally differentiated trends (northern increases versus southern losses, renewed deforestation near population centres). Widespread re-allocation of protection forestlands to production allowed expansion of plantations. Natural forests decreased in provinces where protection forestlands were reduced, and/or where - during 2011-2016 - plantation forests and crop fields expanded. PFES policies exerted minor influences (none to negative) on natural forest cover. PFES funding concentrated on provinces where protection forestlands contracted, and where forestland allocation to households was comparatively undeveloped. Conversely, 'good governance' indicators were positively correlated with sustained protection of natural forestlands. We conclude that governance emphasis on forest protection/restoration during the 1990s-2000s ['transition'] has reverted towards a primacy of forests as spaces of economic production ['transaction']. Policy schemes aimed at forest protection and poverty reduction need to incorporate efficient and transparent mechanisms of participation, monitoring, and adaptive management. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Does health insurance promote people's consumption? New evidence from China
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - In order to change the situation that reimbursement rate of the new rural cooperative medical care system (NCMS) was too low to alleviate farmers medical burden, in August 2012, China began to expand the coverage of the NCMS to include the treatment of critical illnesses. Could more effective health insurance promote the consumption of rural residents? We studied the impact of the critical illness insurance (CII) on rural household consumption, and find that the CII increases per capita household daily consumption by > 15%. But healthcare and medical expenditures have not been affected. Our comparison of outcomes for households with different levels of consumption and income shows the CII mainly promote the consumption of rural affluent family, but no incentive for poor family, resulting in deterioration of consumption inequality of rural households. The finding is robust to various alternative hypotheses and specifications.

AB  - This article examines the impact of marketing cooperatives on smallholder commercialization of cereals using detailed household data in rural Ethiopia. We use the strong government role in promoting the establishment of cooperatives to justify the use of: propensity score matching to compare households that are cooperative members to similar households in comparable areas without cooperatives. The analysis reveals that although cooperatives obtain higher prices for their members, they are not associated with it significant increase in the overall share of cereal production sold commercially by their members. However, these average results hide considerable heterogeneity across households. In particular, we find that smaller farmers tend to reduce their marketed Output as a result of higher prices, whereas the opposite is true for larger farmers.

TI  - Effects of rapid livelihood transitions: Examining local co-developed change following a seaweed farming boom
T2  - MARINE POLICY
AB  - This paper examines the development and effects of a rapid livelihood transition on households, and reflects on how it fits within historic trends of livelihood change for people living in highly variable and vulnerable environments. It also discusses the implications of livelihood dynamism for local governance of natural resources. In recent decades, seaweed cultivation has expanded exponentially in coastal communities across the Asia-Pacific. A case study is presented of a remote small-island community in eastern Indonesia where over the last ten years a dramatic shift in livelihood focus has occurred. Previous dependence on diverse low-productivity livelihood activities transitioned to a predominant focus on seaweed farming. The case shows how social, economic and cultural environments co-develop as people move out of conditions of collective poverty and into more nuclear household-oriented livelihood activities. Specific attention is given to the influence on a marine resource co-management program operating on the island to illustrate how local livelihood dynamics relate to broader paradigm-driven conservation and rural development initiatives. While alternative livelihood programs seek to relieve pressure on resource stocks and provide opportunities for coastal people, this case study provides timely insights into the kinds of unintended effects, trends and impacts that are associated with rapid change in the way people make a living. This study argues that, in addition to achieving higher standards of income and well-being, livelihood improvement interventions need to adequately ensure that conditions under which new livelihood arrangements come to function can be maintained locally.

TI  - An Empirical Examination on the Role of Water User Associations for Irrigation Management in Rural China
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB  - Water user associations (WUAs) are commonly considered a beneficial institution to improve irrigation management. As one of the core components of irrigation reform in China, the number of WUAs has increased from a few in 1995 to nearly 100,000 today. This study examines the performance of irrigation management between villages with WUAs and villages without WUAs, with a set of 15,566 households collected in 941 randomly selected villages from 22 provinces in China. It finds that WUAs do not show overall superiority in almost all aspects in terms of improving irrigation management performance compared with traditional management institutions. Using the institutional analysis and development framework, it further demonstrates the diverse factors that jointly contribute to irrigation management performance, among which the WUAs play small role. The unsatisfactory performance of WUAs may be attributed to the absence of the conditions to support the WUAs functioning in China's centralized political system. To activate the WUAs, policies are recommended such as organizing WUAs based on hydrologic boundary, declining the overlap between the leadership of WUAs and that of the villages, endowing the WUA with more autonomy, and encouraging farmers to participate in the decision-making process. A broader implication of this study is that there are diverse policy options to address water management challenges, which can be selected according to the specific condition. Achieving the congruence between institutional design and local context holds the key for sustainable water management.

TI  - Collective forest tenure reform and household energy consumption: A case study in Yunnan Province, China
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - The recent Collective Forest Tenure Reform in China has started the process of devolving forest management rights from village collectives to households since 2003. In this paper, we study the impact of the reform on rural energy consumption. Devolving forest tenure improves farmers' access to forest products on their newly acquired forestland, and is therefore expected to increase farmers' fuelwood consumption. The reform also allows farmers to adopt some revenue-enhancing forest technologies which may lead to energy switching in farmer households. Our empirical study finds that the devolution significantly increases household fuelwood consumption for both lower and higher income households; the lower income households benefit more. This is welfare-improving in places where alternative fuels are still too costly. We find limited evidence that higher income households in Yunnan begin to substitute alternative commercial fuels for fuelwood when those are available. Our findings suggest further devolution of forest rights, especially in the poor, forest-rich regions.

TI  - Impacts of land consolidation on rural human-environment system in typical watershed of the Loess Plateau and implications for rural development policy
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Exploring the impact of land consolidation on the evolution of rural human-environment system (HES) is of positive significance for optimizing land consolidation model and innovating rural development policy. Taken a typical small watershed in Yan'an city as case study area, this paper explored the impact of gully land consolidation (GLC) on local HES from the perspectives of land use, landscape pattern, ecological security, social economic response and comprehensive evaluation, based on high-resolution remote sensing image data, landscape pattern analysis and household surveys. The results showed that: (1) GLC could contribute to the improvement of land use structure. The terraces, sloping fields, shrub land and grassland at the bottom and both sides of the gully were mostly converted to high quality check dam land. Some of the shrub land were converted to more ecologically suitable native forest due to biological measures. (2) GLC could also help to optimize the landscape pattern. The average patch area and patch cohesion index of the check dam land increased, which indicated that the function of production improved. The landscape shape index and patch cohesion index of forestland and shrub land kept at a high level, and thus their ecological function was stable. At the watershed level, the fragmentation degree of landscape decreased, the landscape tended to be more diversified and balanced, and the anti-jamming capability of landscape and stability of ecosystem improved. (3) GLC have positive effects on the ecological security. Vegetation cover, ecological environment and capacity of flood control improved significantly, and soil erosion decreased by 55%. And (4) human activities responded to the changes of geographical environment. The scale of agricultural production, agricultural mechanization, diversity and non-agriculturalization of employment increased. However, the structure of agriculture is still unitary, the efficiency of agriculture is still low, and rural development is still relatively lagging. Field investigations showed that insufficient public participation, and lack of leadership and overall planning for sustainable utilization of resources and environment are the main reasons. A ladder model has been proposed for better understanding the impacts of land consolidation on territorial human-environment system in rural China. This paper suggests that land consolidation should be seen and evaluated in a broader rural development context, and more efforts should be made to innovate the rural governance mechanism of "common consultation and collective action", thereby exerting the comprehensive effectiveness of land consolidation and promoting the transformation development and revitalization of territorial rural HES.

TI  - Factors influencing intensification of dairy production systems in Ethiopia
T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - Little is known of how dairy intensification driven by socioeconomic issues and dairy development efforts works as well as the challenges of changing production systems in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. A study was carried out to analyze factors determining intensification of dairy production systems and the present status of marketoriented smallholder dairy operations in Ethiopia. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with 200 dairy farmers. The results revealed that 77% of respondents reared improved/crossbred dairy cows, 53.5% acquired good manure management besides crossbreeding, and 44% of the sampled rural households were involved in cultivating improved forage crops and crossbreeding practices. The binary logistic regression model output showed that herd size, farmland size, dairy training, and cooperative membership had significant effects on cultivating improved forages. Dairy production system, dairying experience, and herd size were significantly associated with rearing only crossbred dairy cows. Farmland size, dairy system, and awareness of manure handling were significantly associated with practicing good manure management. Further analysis of the extent of intensification indicated that mean daily milk yield per cow and household milk market share were significantly related to crossbreeding and manure management practices in combination. Thus, production systems-based dairy breeding and manure management, related input supply, and alternative formal marketing options are the key attributes of the intensification and improved productivity of smallholder dairy production that need to be considered while designing policy and intervention.

TI  - Cooperative rice farming within rural Bangladesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF CO-OPERATIVE ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - It is often questioned whether cooperative agriculture by smallholder farmers can replace individual agriculture. This paper draws on a case study of rice farming in Kurigram district, Bangladesh, and provides insight into cooperative rice farming and potential of mechanization. Various cooperative practices (e.g. group rice harvesting and threshing) have been collectively adopted and used by small-scale rice farmers in Kurigram Sadar ever since the Liberation War of 1971. Rice farming in Kurigram Sadar is characterized by informal community-supported agriculture, which is both labor intensive and inefficient. Agricultural mechanization and institutionalized cooperative farming can reverse the situation and indirectly contribute to food security. Applied scenarios demonstrate potential benefits of cooperative farming, ranging from an estimated 12.6% rise in rice production due to reduced post-production losses and 41.5% increase due to intensified cropping to 92% cost savings through labor substitution. Kurigram Sadar rice farming is of great relevance to other parts of ricegrowing Bangladesh as well, as most of the country is dominated by smallholder farmers employing similar agricultural practices.

TI  - Income Guarantees and Borrowing in Risky Environments: Evidence from India's Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme
T2  - ECONOMICA
AB  - This paper investigates the effects of an income guarantee on borrowing in a risky setting with marked seasonality. A three-season, infinite-horizon model is developed, in which the aims of smoothing consumption and maintaining creditworthiness are somewhat opposed and the seasonal timing of transfers matters. If borrowing does not affect production, then larger transfers concentrated in the lean season may well lead to a contraction of the total amount borrowed over the whole annual cycle. If borrowing also finances working capital, then larger transfers make riskier positions attractive, and investment in working capital and total borrowing may both increase. These insights are tested in the context of India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, as implemented in upland Odisha. The potential endogeneity of participation is addressed by using the female reservation for local elections as an instrument. Each day's work reduces the estimated level of borrowing in the lean season by about the regulated wage. In contrast, the estimated effect on borrowing in the cultivation season by households owning at least the median holding is to increase it by about one-and-a-half times the wage; but there is no significant effect for households owning less.

TI  - Regional agricultural cooperatives and subjective wellbeing of rural households in China
T2  - REGIONAL SCIENCE POLICY AND PRACTICE
AB  - This study conducted an empirical analysis of survey data collected from 466 rural households from Shandong Province, China, to determine how the subjective wellbeing of rural households is related to their membership in agricultural cooperatives, and the mediating effects of income and social capital. The results revealed that cooperative membership improved rural households' subjective wellbeing. Furthermore, income and social capital both served as partial mediators between cooperative membership and subjective well-being. Therefore, to improve subjective wellbeing, the role of cooperatives in expanding rural public space should be brought into full play. Moreover, multiple regional development models of cooperatives should be encouraged to increase household income and promote rural regional economic growth.

TI  - Impact of contract farming on income of smallholder malt barley farmers in Arsi and West Arsi zones of Oromia region, Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - This study examined factors that influence farmers' participation in malt barley contract farming and West Arsi zones of Oromia region, Ethiopia. Data were collected from 384 (190 contract and 194 non-contract) randomly selected farm households. The probit model showed that age, livestock ownership, credit access, distance to the main market and cooperative membership had positive and significant effects on decision regarding contract farming participation. Propensity score matching technique was used to estimate the impact of participation in contract farming on farm households' income. And it revealed that contract farming resulted in an increased annual gross farm income of Birr 24,302.20 for contract, which is 27.80% higher than the gross annual income of non-contract malt barley farm households. The finding of this study highlights that contract farming is viable to increase farm household's income, which policy makers and other concerned agencies may consider as an alternative rural development approach so long as it is tailored to contexts alike.

TI  - Turning waste into value: using human urine to enrich soils for sustainable food production in Uganda
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - This article builds on an action research process involving Ugandan smallholder farmers in collaborative experimentation on the use of human urine as a crop fertilizer. The aim is to explore farmers' perceptions and evaluation of the practice as a potential and partial solution to soil productivity problems. Findings show that urine fertilization is valued as a low-cost and low-risk practice contributing to significant yield increases, suggesting important contributions to food security and income, especially for those who have few options in soil nutrient management. Weaknesses identified by farmers relate mainly to limitations in collection and storage capacity rather than to inherent traits of the practice. In conclusion, urine fertilization should be acknowledged as a valuable strategy for supporting sustainable agricultural intensification. Furthermore, the importance of social norms and cultural, perceptions should be recognized but not treated as absolute barriers to diffusion of the practice. Collective action, where groups of farmers jointly develop new procedures and adapt practices, serves as an important arena for social change and negotiation of norms and taboos, which can otherwise limit the acceptance and diffusion of alternative soil management practices. The research finally illustrates that transdisciplinary research can guide pathways towards sustainability through locally anchored and solutions-oriented knowledge generation. (C) 2014 The Author.

TI  - Contract farming and the adoption of sustainable farm practices: Empirical evidence from cashew farmers in Ghana
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES AND POLICY
AB  - Contract farming has been shown to increase agricultural productivity and thus welfare of farmers in developing countries. However, studies that look at the potential environmental effects of contract farming remain quite scanty. This is however crucial, since contract farming may contribute to intensification in cultivation of the contracted crops, in terms of area and the intensity of inputs used. This study investigates the impact of participation in contract farming on sustainable farm practices, using a marginal treatment effects (MTEs) approach to account for potential selection bias and heterogeneity across households. The empirical results show significant heterogeneity in the effects of contract farming on the intensity of sustainable farm practice use. In particular, farmers with high propensity to participate in contract farming tend to have low probabilities of using sustainable farm practices. The findings of this study not only provide new insights into the heterogeneous effects of contract farming, but also entry points for further research to address the dual challenge of agriculture to produce sufficient food, while reducing the adverse impact on the environment.

TI  - Factors influencing rural households' willingness of centralized residence: Comparing pure and nonpure farming areas in China
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - In recent years, Chinese governments began exploring centralized residence of rural households, with a view to protecting farming land through the incorporation and reduction of rural construction land, building new countryside, and solving the problem of insufficient construction land quotas for urban development. In the centralized residence process, it is important to study the willingness of rural households and factors influencing their willingness. This empirical study used Panshan County and Jiangshan City as representatives of pure and nonpure farming areas, respectively. Three logistic regression models were applied, to explore differences between pure and nonpure farming areas and the factors influencing rural households' willingness to accept centralized residence according to five aspects: households individual characteristics, family economy, policy perception, housing conditions, and social environment. The results showed that, for nonpure farming areas, such as Jiangshan City, when there is more trust in the village collective, less arable area, increased satisfaction with infrastructure and higher non-agricultural income, the more willing rural households are to accept centralized residence. In pure farming areas, such as Panshan County, when there are greater expectations of policy, the safer environments and higher non-agricultural income, the more willing rural households are to accept centralized residence. By comparison, rural households in nonpure farming areas are more concerned with fairness future quality of life, while those in pure farming areas are more concerned with implementation and guaranteed compensation. China's centralized residence policy should focus on the objective conditions of each region, and appropriately differentiate based on different areas and categories.

TI  - Dowries, resource allocation, and poverty
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - We study the relationship between dowries - wealth transfers from the bride's family to the groom or his family at the time of marriage - and individual-level poverty in rural India. Based on the estimates of a collective household model, we show that the share of household consumption expenditure allocated to a woman is strongly associated with the dowry she paid at the time of her marriage. We compute poverty rates separately for women and men and find that women's poverty relative to men decreases with dowry. Moreover, women who paid dowries are less likely to be poor relative to women who did not, even when their households' consumption expenditures are the same. Our counterfactual policy analysis indicates that abolishing or reducing dowries (through anti-dowry laws or taxes, for example) may have the unintended effect of aggravating intra-household inequality and increasing women's risk of living in poverty after marriage.

TI  - Exploring hybrid models for universal access to basic solar energy services in informal settlements: Case studies from South Africa and Zimbabwe
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - In order to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), innovative approaches will be required to deliver affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy to Africa's poor. As a partial contributor to this goal, Solar Home Systems (SHSs) are an increasingly affordable and reliable option for low-income, informal settlement, urban households to initially access electricity (for at least lighting and media) in a manner that bypasses the legal, financial and practical barriers that often impede grid electrification. Other authors have argued for adaptive hybrid models for delivering and scaling access to SHS so that synergies between government- donor- or market-led approaches can be harnessed to achieve truly universal, and thus equitable, access. We look at two case studies of SHS delivery models that could, if combined, embody some of the envisaged benefits of the hybrid idea. The first case study is a social enterprise in South Africa that operates as a subsidised fee-for-service solar electricity utility. The emphasis is on efficient operating systems combined with local job creation, which together help to minimise running costs and thus maximise end-user affordability and produce wider local economic benefits. The second case study, in Zimbabwe, uses well-established social processes and women-led savings groups to build strong organisational capacity and accountability within the community. This establishes a robust social contract and a resilient mechanism for technical delivery and grass-roots information flow. The respective strengths and weakness of these two models appear to dovetail in a way that supports the case for a combination of the two approaches in a partnership with a shared core mission of advancing SDG 7 for under-served residents of informal settlements in Sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Impact of land tenure policy on agricultural investments in China: Evidence from a panel data study
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - The goal of this paper is to examine the impact of changes in China's rural land policy on agricultural investments. Dramatic changes occurred in China's rural land policies after 2000, including the extension of rural land contractual period, restriction of land reallocation 'among villages and villagers groups, elimination of agricultural taxes for responsibility land, and rapid development of rural land rental markets. These changes have given farmers more secure tenure on collectively controlled responsibility land and have strengthened farmers' income rights for responsibility lands, incentivizing them to increase their investments on responsibility lands. A panel data method was used to quantitatively investigate the impact of land policy changes on agricultural investment. We considered the application of organic fertilizer as an indicator for long-term agricultural investment, and compared the use of organic fertilizer between private plots and responsibility lands operated by the same household. The results showed that the difference in organic fertilizer use between private plots and responsibility land for the same household has become smaller from 2000 to 2008. Our findings suggest that recent changes in rural land policies have provided farmers incentives to increase land quality investment on their responsibility lands.

TI  - The power of the collective empowers women: Evidence from self-help groups in India
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Women's groups are important rural social and financial institutions in South Asia. In India, a large major-ity of women's groups programs are implemented through self-help groups (SHGs). Originally designed as savings and credit groups, the role of SHGs has expanded to include creating health and nutrition awareness, improving governance, and addressing social issues related to gender-and caste-based dis-crimination. This paper uses panel data from 1470 rural Indian women from five states to study the impact of SHG membership on women's empowerment in agriculture, using the project-level Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-WEAI) and the abbreviated Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (A-WEAI). Because SHG membership was not randomized and women who self-select to be SHG members may be systematically different from non-members, we employ nearest neighbor matching methods to attribute the impact of SHG membership on women's empowerment in agriculture and intrahousehold inequality. Our findings suggest that SHG membership has a significant positive impact on aggregate measures of women's empowerment and reduces the gap between men's and women's empowerment scores. This improvement in aggregate empowerment is driven by improvements in women's scores, not a deterio-ration in men's. Greater control over income, greater decisionmaking over credit, and (somewhat mech-anistically, given the treatment) greater and more active involvement in groups within the community lead to improvements in women's scores. However, impacts on other areas of empowerment are limited. The insignificant impacts on attitudes towards domestic violence and respect within the household sug -gest that women's groups alone may be insufficient to change deep-seated gender norms that disem-power women. Our results have implications for the design and scale-up of women's group-based programs in South Asia, including the possibility that involving men is needed to change gender norms.

TI  - The Social Dynamics of Labor Shortage in South African Small-Scale Agriculture
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This article examines the relationship between unemployment, family structure, and labor allocation in rural South Africa. Chronic joblessness has meant that many young, unemployed adults remain in the parental home. However, their productive labor is often not utilized in family farming. Using detailed ethnographic data on intra-household social relations, I argue that the prohibitive cost of marriage, and its consequent decline, has led to the erosion of obligations formerly implied by the "conjugal contract". Young, unmarried adults often have limited responsibilities to provide labor or income to the parental home, diminishing the overall viability of small-scale farming. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Examining the impact of forestry policy on poor and non-poor farmers' income and production input in collective forest areas in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Forestry policy plays an important role in China's collective forest areas in improving the management efficiency of forest land and promoting poverty alleviation amongst farmers. The data used in this study comes from the follow-up monitoring survey data for 454 households in the 10 counties of Liaoning Province from 2012 to 2016. We use a two-way fixed effect model to analyse the policy factors that affect the income and investment of non-poor and poor farmers. Besides, from the perspective of factors output elasticity, the impact mechanism of policies on forestry income is explored. Our results indicate that: i) in terms of forest land contracting policies, we verified that the clarification of forest land contract rights provides important guarantees for households to invest in productive inputs (especially for poor families). ii) Of the forestry fiscal subsidy policies analysed, the ecological benefits subsidies were found to promote forestry income and stimulate input. In particular, it has an incentive effect on the output elasticity of labour factors of poor farmers. Moreover, the under-forest economic subsidies can promote the increase in forestry income through improving the output elasticity of capital factors for non-poor farmers. iii) In the aspect of forestry financial insurance policies, the forest tenure mortgage loans can only increase the factor input of non-poor farmers, and the impact on farmers' forestry income was not significant. The forest insurance policy has a significant effect on the forestry income of all farmers because it can increase the output elasticity of capital factors of non-poor farmers and the output elasticity of capital and labour factors of poor farmers.

TI  - The diversity of smallholder chicken farming in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania reveals a range of underlying production constraints
T2  - POULTRY SCIENCE
AB  - The poultry industry in Tanzania has grown steadily over the past decade. We surveyed 121 chicken farming households along an intensification gradient from backyard to semi-intensive and intensive production systems based on rearing system and assumed purpose and poultry breed in the Iringa region. About 30% of households had more than one breed and/or rearing system combination. The subdivision of poultry systems was refined by adding the size of the flocks to highlight variation in scale of operations. On this basis we distinguished 3 main types: 1) subsistence small-scale free-range chicken production; 2) market-oriented small to medium scale semi-intensive and 3) small to medium-large scale intensive systems. `Intensification' involves the transition from keeping indigenous chickens to improved dual-purpose and exotic breeds driven by greater productivity and potential for income generation. The more intensive the production system, the more the intensity and diversity of diseases identified by farmers as their main problem, which was partly attributed to the greater sensitivity of the improved breeds, poor veterinary measures, and the high chicken density facilitating disease spread. Based on the survey we constructed a problem tree to classify the underlying constraints and their interrelations, and to identify common root causes, based on which we propose practical solutions to improve chicken production. Development of medium-large scale systems is particularly constrained by a limited supply of 1-dayold chicks and theft. By contrast, intensification of small-scale systems is constrained by limited access to quality feed, vaccines and medicines, capital, and lack of a reliable market, partly due to the absence of farmer organization. These constraints can be addressed through formation of producer groups and promotion of outgrower and enterprise development models. Enterprise development appears to be the most promising business model for smallholder chicken farmers given that it allows farmers more freedom in decision-making and management while strengthening linkages with input suppliers and output markets to' ensure a viable and profitable business.

TI  - Status differences in collective action and forest benefits: evidence from joint forest management in India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Does status matter in community-based forest management? If so, are the high-status households more benefited than the low-status households? What drives status differences, if any, in the appropriation of forest resources? To address these questions, we draw on a theory of status and resource use that defines one's status as one's relative position in a group on the basis of power, prestige, honor and deference. Following this perspective, we surveyed the heads of 341 forest-based rural households in India from 2009 to 2010. We find that collective actions themselves are status-driven and the high-status households are more interested and involved in status-maintaining collective actions such as decision-making and implementation, while the low-status households perform general tasks like forest patrol. Moreover, the high-status households derive benefits from local forest significantly more than the low-status households. Further, decomposition analysis shows that a household's prestige and honor measured by its access to social resources, problem faced and useful contacts explain about 56 % of the status gap in forest benefits, while socioeconomic characteristics explain only 16 % of the gap. Thus, due emphasis on household status from a broader socioeconomic perspective is required to reduce inequality in participation and the distribution of forest benefits in co-management.

TI  - Livelihood diversification, mobile phones and information diversity in Northern Tanzania
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Throughout the developing world, households are diversifying their livelihood activities to manage risk and improve their lives. Many studies have focused on the material causes and consequences of this diversification. Few, however, have examined how diversifying groups establish new patterns of communication and information exchange with others. This paper examines the relationship between livelihood diversification and information diversity among agro-pastoralist Maasai in northern Tanzania, where new mobile phone use is common. Mixed qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection and analysis are used to (1) describe how Maasai use phones to manage diverse livelihoods; and (2) assess the relationship between livelihood diversification and measures of information diversity, controlling for other factors. The findings indicate that households use phones in ways that support existing activities rather than transform them and that the relationship between livelihood diversification and information diversity is positive, non-linear, and significant.

TI  - The influence of clan social capital on collective biogas investment
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of clan social capital on the willingness to pay (WTP) and WTP value for collective biogas investment. Design/methodology/approach Using the Heckman two-stage model and a dataset of 1,265 representative observations from three provinces in Central China collected in 2019, this paper utilizes the contingent valuation method to estimate households' WTP value for collective biogas investment. The paper also explores the heterogeneity between households with different clan governance mechanisms and village governance structures. Findings The results indicate that clan networks and trust were likely to improve farmer households' WTP, while clan trust and norms could improve their WTP values. For clans with councils and for clans that can influence the decision-making of village committees, their members were more likely to be influenced by the social capital of their clans to pay for collective biogas investment. Originality/value This paper focuses on the WTP and WTP values of households for collective biogas investment, which is often neglected in the research. This paper suggests that clans can be used as a medium to urge households to increase their collective power to reduce carbon emissions and climate crises. The findings empirically contribute to efforts to reduce rural carbon emissions.

TI  - Linking Smallholders to Markets: Determinants and Impacts of Farmer Collective Action in Kenya
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This article investigates determinants and impacts of cooperative organization, using the example of smallholder banana farmers in Kenya. Farmer groups are inclusive of the poor, although wealthier households are more likely to join. Employing propensity score matching, we find positive income effects for active group members. Yet price advantages of collective marketing are small, and high-value market potentials have not yet been tapped. Beyond prices, farmer groups function as important catalysts for innovation adoption through promoting efficient information flows. We discuss the conditions under which collective action is useful, and through what mechanisms the potential benefits emerge. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Agricultural Biodiversity in the Tajik Pamirs A Bridge Between Market Development and Food Sovereignty
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study investigates the role that local fruit varieties can play in achieving the dual objectives of food sovereignty and income generation in the Tajik Pamir Mountains. In this very harsh environment, agriculture is characterized by a great diversity of fruit varieties central to local food culture and household security. Local fruit trees can grow in poor soils on slopes and their resistance to diseases, cold, and ultraviolet light give them marked advantages over introduced varieties. However, the humanitarian crisis following the collapse of the Soviet Union and recent efforts by development organizations to create markets by introducing exotic varieties are negatively affecting agricultural biodiversity (agrobiodiversity) and, potentially, household security. A study was carried out in 3 districts of the Gorno-Badakhshan province to investigate the household consumption and market potential of products derived from local varieties of apple, apricot, and mulberry and how these products could be better exploited to benefit community livelihoods and agrobiodiversity conservation. Results show that fruit represents the farmers' main source of food and income. Many local varieties are maintained for a variety of reasons related to household consumption, whereas the main reason for cultivating introduced varieties is income generation. Great care must therefore be taken in planning market strategies: a pure market focus will almost certainly endanger household security, whereas a strategy linking income generation through the commercialization of crop varieties to the promotion of qualities central to household needs will improve diversity and public health. The opportunities identified to help enhance the market potential of local fruits and maintain the Pamir's unique biocultural heritage include efforts to raise public awareness among producers and consumers of the nutritional and medicinal properties of local varieties; training for pest management, processing, and packaging; and the establishment of farmers' cooperatives.

TI  - Vulnerability and resilience of remote rural communities to shocks and global changes: Empirical analysis from Solomon Islands
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Successful management of socio-ecological systems not only requires the development and field-testing of robust and measurable indices of vulnerability and resilience but also improved understanding of the contextual factors that influence societal capacity to adapt to change. We present the results of an analysis conducted in three coastal communities in Solomon Islands. An integrated assessment map was used to systematically scan the communities' multiple dimensions of vulnerability and to identify factors affecting households' perception about their capacity to cope with shocks (resilience). A multivariate probit approach was used to explore relationships amongst factors. Social processes such as community cohesion, good leadership, and individual support to collective action were critical factors influencing the perception that people had about their community's ability to build resilience and cope with change. The analysis also suggests a growing concern for a combination of local (internal) and more global (external) contingencies and shocks, such as the erosion of social values and fear of climate change.

TI  - A place at the table is not enough: Accountability for Indigenous Peoples and local communities in multi-stakeholder platforms
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Virtually all major efforts to address global problems regarding land and resource use call for a multi stakeholder process. At the same time, there is growing interest in, and commitment to, inclusion of previously marginalized groups - e.g., Indigenous Peoples and local communities (IPLCs), smallholders, and women in these groups - in decisions related to sustainable land and resource governance. Nevertheless, multi-stakeholder platforms and forums (MSFs) tend to be idealized as imagined spaces for collaboration among equals, despite ample prior research demonstrating that fostering equity in such "invited spaces" is no easy feat. This article draws on a comparative study of 11 subnational MSFs aimed at improving land and forest use practices in Brazil, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Peru. It analyzes data from interviews with more than 50 IPLC forum participants to understand their perspective on efforts to address equity in the MSFs in which they are participating, as well as their opinion of the potential of MSFs in comparison with other participants. The research sought to understand how MSFs can ensure voice and empowerment and address inequality, and thus be accountable to the needs and interests of IPLCs. The interviews show that IPLCs are overall optimistic, but the results also provide insights into accountability failures. The article argues that to bring about change - one that takes equality, empowerment and justice seriously - there needs to be greater strategic attention to how marginalized groups perceive their participation in multi-stakeholder processes. It builds on the lessons from the literature and the findings to propose specific ways that MSFs might foster the collective action or counter power that less powerful actors need to hold more powerful actors accountable.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Combining participatory games and backcasting to support collective scenario evaluation: an action research approach for sustainable agroforestry landscape management
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB  - The combined and interacting effects of land-use change, resource extraction and climate change threaten the sustainability of millions of mainly smallholder farms in tropical agroforested landscapes. In many of these landscapes, coordinated action among stakeholders at landscape level would help to address challenges such as pests and diseases, price crises and climate change. However, methods to facilitate the co-production of sustainable landscape management in such complex multi-stakeholder systems are currently largely lacking. In this paper, we present a novel approach to explore pathways for the sustainability transition of agroforestry systems. By combining participatory forecasting and backcasting approaches, based on serious games and future vision development, we explore relevant agroforestry management strategies for reaching sustainable future coffee-based agroforestry landscapes. We focused our research on the challenges faced in the main coffee-producing area in Nicaragua. Here, we organized five participatory game sessions to explore farmer decision-making processes, farming strategies and to develop new networks and stimulate social learning among farmers. In the associated backcasting workshop, the most influential game session participants joined technicians, researchers and municipality officials to collectively envision sustainable future landscape management. In all game sessions, farmers developed diversified coffee-based agroforested landscapes characterised by increased density and diversity of shade trees, for the purpose of income diversification as well as forest conservation. During the backcasting workshop, the participants identified policy instruments and community-based solutions for the transition to sustainable landscapes. Our participatory approach facilitated discussion on landscape planning among farmers and other stakeholders and allowed the outline of a pathway towards the collective envisioned future landscape. The combination of participatory forecasting and backcasting proved to be a helpful tool to support multi-stakeholder processes towards sustainable landscape management in this and other complex landscapes.

TI  - Who Went Where... and Why: Patterns and Consequences of Displacement in Rural Zimbabwe after February 2000
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - Households in Zimbabwe are currently experiencing an ongoing series of multiple and complex shocks. In contrast with 'conventional' shocks such as droughts, which are usually singular in nature, the contemporary environment challenges households with, among other things, hyperinflation, an extreme and prolonged contraction of the economy, massive unemployment, a cholera pandemic, and politically motivated violence - all exacerbated by formidable failings in governance. In this setting, 'traditional' risk-sharing and insurance mechanisms have been taxed to their limits. In their efforts to avoid permanent loss of well-being, households have adopted, or had forced upon them, coping strategies in which mobility is a central element. This article is an exercise in empirical micro-demographics that explores patterns and consequences of population dynamics in rural Zimbabwe, beginning with the commercial farm invasions that were initiated in early 2000.

TI  - The Impact of Public Health Insurance on Household Credit Availability in Rural China: Evidence from NRCMS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - A large body of literature has shown that the burden of healthcare can push individuals and households into the burden of medical care and income loss. This makes it difficult for rural or low-income households to obtain and use safe and affordable formal credit services. In 2003, China's government implemented a new rural public health insurance, which was called the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS). This study provides evidence of the impact of NRCMS on household credit availability using the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) for 2010. The tobit regression approach and mediator model are used. The results show that, as a public health insurance system sustained by the participation of government investment, the NRCMS provides good "collateral" and significantly enhances rural households' formal credit availability level. Furthermore, this positive effect is mainly reflected in the economic effect of NRCMS. Our results are robust to alternative statistical methods. Our findings suggest that expanding access, fulfilling the NRCMS mortgage function, and providing more financial services for rural households would have big benefits with regard to easing credit constraints for rural residents.

TI  - Non-evidence-based policy: How effective is China's new cooperative medical scheme in reducing medical impoverishment?
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - In recent years, many lower to middle income countries have looked to insurance as a means to protect their populations from medical impoverishment. In 2003, the Chinese government initiated the New Cooperative Medical System (NCMS), a government-run voluntary insurance program for its rural population. The prevailing model of NCMS combines medical savings accounts with high-deductible catastrophic hospital insurance (MSA/Catastrophic). To assess the effectiveness of this approach in reducing medical impoverishment, we used household survey data from 2006 linked to claims records of health expenditures to simulate the effect of MSA/Catastrophic on reducing the share of individuals failing below the poverty line (headcount), and the amount by which household resources fall short of the poverty line (poverty gap) due to medical expenses. We compared the effects of MSA/Catastrophic to Rural Mutual Health Care (RMHC), an experimental model that provides first dollar coverage for primary care, hospital services and drugs with a similar premium but a lower ceiling. Our results show that RMHC is more effective at reducing medical impoverishment than NCMS. Under the internationally accepted poverty line of US$1.08 per person per day, the MSA/Catastrophic models would reduce the poverty headcount by 3.5-3.9% and the average poverty gap by 11.8-16.4%, compared with reductions of 6.1-6.8% and 15-18.5% under the RMHC model. The primary reason for this is that NCMS does not address a major cause of medical impoverishment: expensive outpatient services for chronic conditions. As such, health policymakers need first to examine the disease profile and health expenditure pattern of a population before they can direct resources to where they will be most effective. As chronic diseases impose a growing share of the burden on the population in developing countries, it is not necessarily true that insurance coverage focusing on expensive hospital care alone is the most effective at providing financial risk protection.

TI  - The role of social grants on commercialization among smallholder farmers in South Africa: Evidence from a continuous treatment approach
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - This study examined the role of social grants to smallholder producers' incentives to sell maize marketable surplus. The study used the generalized propensity score (GPS) matching method to analyse the data collected from a sample of 774 smallholder producers in KwaZulu-Natal. The results support the disincentive hypothesis, demonstrating a negative association between social grants and market participation levels of smallholders. The study findings imply that policies aimed at increasing smallholder commercialization should also focus on how to reduce the disincentive effects of social grants.

TI  - Micro-insurance against drought risk in a changing climate Assessing demand and supply considerations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - Novel micro-insurance schemes are emerging to help the poor better deal with droughts and other disasters. Climate change is projected to increase the intensity and frequency of disasters and is already adding stress to actual and potential clients of these schemes. As well, insurers and reinsurers are increasingly getting worried about increasing claim burdens and the robustness of their pricing given changing risks. The purpose of this paper is to review and suggest ways to methodologically tackle the challenges regarding the assessment of drought risk and the viability of index-based insurance arrangements in the light of changing risks and climate change.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on novel modeling approaches, the authors take supply as well as demand side perspectives by combining risk analysis with regional climate projections and linking this to household livelihood modeling and insurance pricing. Two important examples in Malawi and India are discussed, where such schemes have been or are about to be implemented.
   Findings - The authors find that indeed micro-insurance instruments may help low-income farming households better manage drought risk by smoothing livelihoods and reducing debt, thus avoiding poverty traps. Yet, also many obstacles to optimal design, viability and affordability of these schemes, are encountered. One of those is climate change and the authors find that changing drought risk under climate change would pose a threat to the viability of micro-insurance, as well as the livelihoods of people requesting such contracts.
   Originality/value - The findings and suggestions may corroborate the case for donor support for existing or emerging insurance arrangements helping the poor better cope with climate variability and change. Furthermore, a closer linkage between climate and global change models with insurance and risk management models should be established in the future, which could be beneficial for both sides.

TI  - Seasonal variation in the prevalence of acute undernutrition among children under five years of age in east rural Ethiopia: a longitudinal study
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Malnutrition is a deficiency state of both macro and micronutrients (under - nutrition) and their over consumption (over- nutrition) causing measurable adverse effects on human body structure and function, resulting in specific physical and clinical outcomes. Little has been known about the seasonal variation in the magnitude of acute child under-nutrition and its determinants in low and middle-income countries making difficult the choice of a better nutrition intervention. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of acute under-nutrition and its associated factors on children aged 6 to 36 months in east rural Ethiopia in wet and dry seasons.
   Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted on children aged 6 to 36 months and their mothers (mother-child pairs) from July/August 2010/2011 to January/February 2011/2012 in east rural Ethiopia. Data were collected from 2,132 mother-child pairs using a pretested structured questionnaire and the UNICEF recommended anthropometric measuring instruments after standardization. The Odds Ratio with 95% confidence interval was estimated to identify the predictors of acute child under nutrition (wasting) using a conditional fixed-effects logistic regression.
   Results: The prevalence of acute child under-nutrition was 7.4%; 95% CI: (6.3%, 8.5%) in wet and 11.2%; 95% CI: (9.8%, 12.5%) in dry seasons. Child wasting was more common among children of poor households who had no cooperative bank saving accounts [AOR (95% CI) = 8.2. (1.8, 37.6)], and access to health facilities [AOR (95% CI) = 2.2 (1.4, 3.6)].
   Conclusion: Acute child under-nutrition was relatively higher in the dry season. Although season was not significantly associated with child under - nutrition, poverty and poor access to health services were important predictors of wasting in the study setting. Thus, effective community-based nutrition interventions that require a multi - disciplinary approach should be scaled up to curb childhood under-nutrition.

TI  - Heterogeneity of the impact of health insurance on saving behaviours in rural China
T2  - REVUE D ECONOMIE POLITIQUE
AB  - This paper evaluates the impact of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme on household savings by quartiles of income in rural China. Thanks to CHNS data, we estimate the impact of this health insurance on household savings for each quartile of income by using ordinary-least-square and two-stage-least-square estimations. We find a significant negative impact of the participation in NCMS on savings for middle-income households only. This result remains when we control for a possible endogeneity arising when we build savings on health expenses. As NCMS has no impact on health expenditures for all quartiles of income, we conclude that the decrease in savings, associated to NCMS participation, results from a reduction of households income risk rather than a reduction of health expenses.

TI  - Did Higher Inequality Impede Growth in Rural China?
T2  - ECONOMIC JOURNAL
AB  - We estimate the relationship between village inequality and subsequent income growth for households in rural China. Using a longitudinal household-level survey spanning 19872002, we find that households from higher inequality villages experienced lower income growth. However, the effect of local inequality fades by 2002. Our evidence points to unobserved village institutions at the time of economic reforms, associated with household access to higher income activities, as the source of the link between inequality and growth. We address several econometric issues including measurement error and attrition, but underscore others that are probably intractable for all investigations of the inequalitygrowth relationship.

TI  - Dependence of the Poor on Forest Resources: Evidence from China
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - Quantifying the contribution of forest income to household's total income, especially the poorest, is important to understand rural livelihoods, causes of poverty and designing effective development and conservation strategies. Based on a large-scale household investigation of 1495 rural households of 82 villages in 7 provinces in China in 2014-2015, this study used descriptive statistical analysis and built multilevel models to explain individual heterogeneity. Results showed that: (1) the poorest households are the less dependent on non-farm income than other households due to fewer non-farm work opportunities; (2) forest income is important for all households, although poorest ones relied more on forests; (3) the average forest income of households in the richest group is three times as much as that of households in the poorest group; (4) forest income can be increased with more land accessible to the poor and fairer harvest quota applying system. Improving roads condition and increasing forest cooperatives increase household forest income as well. The findings of this paper will be useful in designing alternative policies to alleviate poverty and protect forest resources.

TI  - 'The house cannot stay empty': a case of young rural Nepalis negotiating multilocal householding
T2  - ASIAN POPULATION STUDIES
AB  - Over the past few decades, the mobility of young people abroad for education and labour has been rapidly increasing in Nepal, which has impacted both rural communities and household life. Based on ethnographic field data from Eastern Nepal, this paper explores how multilocality affects the socio-spatial dimensions of householding, i.e. how siblings negotiate their roles as movers and stayers in relation to household obligations, individual aspirations and shifting socio-economic opportunities. This paper draws on and contributes to scholarly debates on how migration impacts social transformation in places, with a particular focus on the dynamics of multilocal householding. We argue that a common agreement between generations and siblings that the house cannot stay empty' reinforces the importance of the household as a meaningful place exercised through the maintenance of traditional intra- and intergenerational contracts and the practice of rotating presence and absence.

TI  - Potential of Corporate Social Responsibility for Poverty Alleviation among Contract Sugarcane Farmers in the Nzoia Sugarbelt, Western Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
AB  - Although contract sugarcane farming is the most dominant and popular land use among farmers in Nzoia Sugarbelt, results from a 2007 study suggests that the intended goal of increasing farmers' incomes seems to have failed. With a mean monthly income of Kenya Shillings 723 (US $ 10) from an average cane acreage of 0.38 hectares, it would be difficult for a household of eight family members to meet their basic needs and lead a decent life. Analysis of farmer statements showed that up to 86% of the changes in net income were significantly determined by six cost variables as a group (i.e., acreage, tillage costs, seedcane costs, transport costs, yield, and farmer's education level). Area under sugarcane had the greatest influence on net income whereby an increase in one hectare under cane would result in an increase of Kenya Shillings 110,427 in net income (per crop cycle of 21 months), holding other variables constant. This translates into Kenya shillings 5,258 per month (or 175 per day per household, or for a family of eight people-KES 22 or US $ 0.3) per member, which is far below the international standard of absolute poverty. Key net income depressors were tillage, seedcane, and transportation costs, all of which were determined by the company with no input from farmers. To bridge income gaps between the company and farmers in favor of sustainable community livelihoods, this paper argues strongly for the need to institutionalize Corporate Social Responsibility within the daily operations of the company particularly to address net-income depressors. Ten key building blocks for such a policy for Nzoia Sugar Company are suggested, based on farmers' responses and ethical considerations.

T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - The global spread of Covid-19 led to travel and market restrictions that impacted Guatemala's rural food systems. This distinct economic shock directly affected campesinos, or small-scale farmers who depend on subsistence and commercial food production. Some Guatemalan farmer organizations have been promoting agroecology for decades in efforts to strengthen rural livelihoods and food sovereignty, defend Indigenous rights, and adapt to climate change, and agroecology is positioned as a tool for resilience to various shocks. We consider the neoliberal cooptation of the concept of resilience, and its usefulness in preserving alternative and previous (Indigenous) practices. Data from surveys and semi-structured interviews with farmers and leaders at eight organizations that promote agroecology suggests that prior engagement with a farmer organization, enacted through both agroecological practices and social networks, contributes to campesino resilience to the pandemic's economic shock at the farm level, with regards to production and consumption. This study illustrates the range and diversity of strategies taken up by campesinos during the pandemic, and considers the importance of social networks for collective actions that increase current and future economic solidarity in campesino communities.

TI  - An empirical study of land rental development in rural Gansu, China: The role of agricultural cooperatives and transaction costs
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The land rental ratio in China has increased significantly over recent years, with the national average reaching 37% in 2017. A significant body of literature has analyzed the driving force behind this movement; however, there still remains much to be learned about the land rental markets in rural China. This paper analyzes the factors that influence the land exchange in Gansu province whose land rental ratio was among the lowest in China at the start of the 2010s. Our contribution to the literature is to provide empirical insights into the factors that promote and impede the development of land rental markets. To this end, we estimate the land rental ratio equation using a panel dataset of 86 counties in Gansu province. The identification strategy is an application of the instrumental variable estimation method based on a fixed effects model. We draw the following conclusions from the analysis. First, agricultural cooperatives have a positive impact on the land rental development, suggesting that non-farm household producers are the major contributors to the demand side of farmland exchange. Second, transaction costs have a detrimental effect on land exchange, as theoretically supported by this study as well as empirical finding in the literature. Accordingly, the public organizations and/or rural collective play a vital role in reducing the transaction costs arising from land use disputes among lessors and lessees.

TI  - Insuring against health shocks: Health insurance and household choices
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper provides empirical evidence on the role of public health insurance in mitigating adverse outcomes associated with health shocks. Exploiting the rollout of a universal health insurance program in rural China, I find that total household income and consumption are fully insured against health shocks even without access to health insurance. Household labor supply is an important insurance mechanism against health shocks. Access to health insurance helps households to maintain investment in children's human capital during negative health shocks, which suggests that one benefit of health insurance could arise from reducing the use of costly smoothing mechanisms.

TI  - Impact of E-Commerce Adoption on Farmers' Participation in the Digital Financial Market: Evidence from Rural China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH
AB  - Although the increasing adoption of digital finance in recent years has exerted a wide-ranging influence on farmers' consumption and production activities, many farmers in China still seriously suffer from digital financial exclusion. Few studies have documented the different impacts of e-commerce adoption characterized by online purchases and sales on farmers' participation in the digital financial market measured by their engagement in digital payments, digital wealth management, and digital credit in rural China. Using survey data from 832 entrepreneurial households in rural China, we contribute to the literature by confirming that both online purchases and sales have a robust significant and positive impact on farmers' participation in the digital financial market and that this impact on digital wealth management is successively larger than that on digital payments and digital credit, with the propensity score matching (PSM) method and instrument variable (IV) approach employed. We further discover that the impact of online purchases and sales on farmers' participation in the digital financial market is significantly mediated by digital financial literacy. Moreover, the impact of online purchases and sales on farmers' participation in the digital financial market is larger for those with high education levels, pursuing skills training, running new agricultural operation entities (i.e., family farms, professional cooperatives), and engaging in agricultural entrepreneurship. Our findings suggest that more effective measures to enhance adoption rates of online purchases and sales, innovation in rural market-oriented digital financial products and services, systematic training for farmers in e-commerce skills as well as digital financial literacy, and differentiated support measures for different groups of farmers to reduce the gap are urgently needed in China.

TI  - STATUS OF POTATO HUSBANDRY AND FARMER'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROFILE IN MOISTURE AND HEAT PRONE KARNATAKA, INDIA
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB  - Hassan district of Karnataka (India) plays an important role of providing processing grade potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) during September to December months when there is real dearth of such potatoes in the country. However, shallow soils, low soil carbon, inadequate irrigation water (126% cropping intensity in study area) and heat stress have been bothering farmers of this area for a long time. In addition, severe late blight infestations during recent years have played havoc for potato farmers, dragging average potato productivity in the area to sub seven tonne/hectare levels. Current study was carried out to analyse socio-economics of potato farmers in Hassan district of Karnataka so that policy makers and development agencies take right decisions towards upliftment of potato farmers of this area. District wise annual compound growth rates (ACGRs) of potato area, production and productivity were estimated for the period during 1999-00 to 2009-10. During this period, potato area in Hassan district expanded at 11.5% ACGR, the corresponding production and productivity figures decelerated by 2 and 12%, respectively. The study of various socio-economic factors revealed that the sampled households were deprived of even the basic household necessities such as food security (33% total and 65% landless labourer respondents), personal water connection (72% respondents) and toilets (68% respondents). Potato contract farming arrangements between potato farmers and the leading contractor, PepsiCo India were also studied. This article recommends enhanced emphasis of Indian government on irrigation development under various rural development schemes and consolidation of land holdings in order to facilitate farm mechanization and improved agricultural profitability.

TI  - Do Payments for Environmental Services Affect Forest Cover? A Farm-Level Evaluation from Costa Rica
T2  - LAND ECONOMICS
AB  - Payments for environmental services (PES) are popular despite little empirical evidence of their effectiveness. We estimate the impact of PES on forest cover in a region known for exemplary implementation of one of the best-known and longest-lived PES programs. Our evaluation design combines sampling that incorporates prematching, data from remote sensing and household surveys, and empirical methods that include partial identification with weak assumptions, difference-in-differences matching estimators, and tests of sensitivity to unobservable heterogeneity. PES in our study site increased participating farm forest cover by about 11% to 17% of the mean area under PES contract over eight years.

TI  - Mobile Internet adoption and technology adoption extensity: evidence from litchi growers in southern China
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of mobile Internet adoption on technology adoption extensity. Design/methodology/approach This study uses cross-sectional data collected in 2018 from 932 smallholder litchi farmers in Guangdong Province and Guangxi Province in southern China. A Poisson regression with endogenous treatment effects (ETPR) model is applied to estimate the effects of mobile Internet adoption on technology adoption extensity. Findings The ETPR model results indicate that mobile Internet adoption can significantly enhance technology adoption extensity. In addition, the extensity of technology adoption is also determined by education level, training, share of litchi farming income, guidebook use and cooperative membership. Disaggregated analyses further confirm the positive impact of mobile Internet adoption on the number of capital- and labor-intensive technologies adopted. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature on agricultural technology adoption. The findings highlight the need to facilitate modern agricultural technology penetration by promoting the use of mobile Internet technologies.

TI  - Drivers of agricultural cooperative formation and farmers' membership and patronage decisions in Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF CO-OPERATIVE ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Agricultural cooperatives are a prominent economic organization for farmers in agro-food systems. Industrial organization and new institutional economics theories explain the existence of agricultural cooperatives and farmers' participation in them through their ability to develop 'countervailing power' within markets and internalizing transaction costs, respectively. Using a unique dataset that includes community, cooperative, and household level survey data, this study empirically investigates the drivers of agricultural cooperatives formation and farmers' membership and patronage decisions in Ethiopia. The results indicate that agricultural cooperatives in Ethiopia tend to exist in locations that are connected to major roads with relatively well-developed market structures, supporting the industrial organization argument linked to market power for their formation more than the new institutionalists argument linked to overcoming potential contractual failures. A farm household's decision to join and use agricultural cooperatives, on the other hand, is strongly related to their location, scale of operation, specialization, and human and relational capital. A household's membership and patronage decisions are also affected by the size, specialization, and integration of the agricultural cooperative itself.

TI  - Tobacco, contract farming, and agrarian change in Zimbabwe
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE
AB  - The growth of smallholder tobacco production since 2000 has been one of the big stories of Zimbabwe's post-land reform experience. Yet the implications for agrarian change, and the consequences for new relations between farmers, the state, and agribusiness capital have rarely been discussed. The paper reports on work carried out in the Mvurwi area of Mazowe district in Zimbabwe with a sample of 220 A1 (smallholder) farmers and 100 former farmworkers resident in compounds on the same farms. By going beyond a focus on operational and business dimensions of contract farming, the paper concludes with reflections on the implications for understanding agrarian relations and social differentiation in those areas of Zimbabwe where tobacco growing is now significant, with lessons more broadly on the political economy of contract farming, and the integration of agribusiness capital following land reform.

TI  - Does Classification-Based Forest Management Promote Forest Restoration? Evidence from China's Ecological Welfare Forestland Certification Program
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Classification-based forest management (CFM) is generally regarded as an important political means of achieving sustainable forest development. However, in the upsurge of publicly managed forest devolution, the impact of CFM policies on forestland restoration remains uncertain and needs to be explored. This study contributes to the scant literature on this topic in China, where CFM has long been implemented based on the ecological welfare forestland (EWF) certification program. We use provincial data from China to examine the relationship between EWF-certified areas and forest restoration. Based on inter-provincial panel data from the third to the ninth consecutive forest resource inventories in China (1984-2018), we use a dynamic spatial autoregressive model to analyze the impact of forest classification management on forest restoration. The results show that, contrary to appearances, increasing EWF-certified areas promotes forest restoration. However, after controlling for other possible influencing factors, increasing EWF-certified areas plays a minimal role in promoting forest restoration and regrowth by inhibiting investment in forest management and even has a negative impact on forest restoration in the southern collective forest area.

TI  - Uptake of agroforestry-based crop management in the semi-arid Sahel - Analysis of joint decisions and adoption determinants
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - IntroductionAgroforestry plays a vital role in maintaining and developing the resilience and productivity of farms and landscapes. Scientific evidence from the Sahel region suggests that integration of trees and shrubs has the potential to improve temperature and moisture levels whilst providing bio-based fertilizer that contributes to increased yields of annual crops. However, little is known about the factors that influence the diffusion of agroforestry. This study examines joint decisions on the use of agroforestry alongside other complementary agricultural practices and disentangles agroforestry awareness from adoption and disadoption decisions. MethodsOur analysis is based on a comprehensive farm-level dataset covering almost 3,000 farm households in Mali and Senegal. A large number of adoption determinants are utilized, with a special focus on information access, information flows and social groups. ResultsThe findings suggest that extension access and training participation boost awareness of agroforestry-based soil fertility management, while information provided by public extension, NGOs and community members is strongly associated with higher adoption intensity. In the analysis of disadoption, farmer-to-farmers exchange in the community was found to be a key factor in the decision to maintain agroforestry use. Membership in cooperatives and youth groups appear to have a favorable effect on awareness and adoption in Mali, but less so in the Senegalese case. Similarly, only results from Mali show that adoption of agroforestry is accompanied by the adoption of other sustainable intensification practices and lower use of synthetic pesticides. DiscussionWe conclude that in order to support the transition to more widespread agroforestry-based soil fertility management, it is essential to strengthen public and NGO-based advisory systems that fully engage with local knowledge networks.

TI  - Tackling climate change under time-poverty: Cooperatives as temporal pacers
T2  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We help to unravel how smallholder farmers in agricultural cooperatives can address the consequences of climate change. Climate change-oriented actions often pose an extra challenge to cooperative members in time-poverty, that is, to those who have no choice but to work long hours yet remain consumption poor. Tackling climate change requires future-oriented action toward unpredictable events, whereas time-poverty requires people to deal with the bare necessities of the present. Through a qualitative inductive study of Rwandan smallholder farmers in agricultural cooperatives, we observe that climate change increases time-poverty, especially for women, and that smallholder farmers are hesitant to invest their time in making climate change adaptations. We find that smallholder farmers can overcome these challenges through membership of agricultural cooperatives, which can help in pacing climate change actions.

TI  - Community-based tourism as social entrepreneurship promoting sustainable development in coastal communities: a study in Thua Thien Hue province, Central Vietnam
T2  - MARITIME STUDIES
AB  - Community-based tourism (CBT) has been considered a popular approach to sustainable development, especially in rural areas of developing countries. However, the different trajectories of the CBT approach and mixed empirical evidence have led to a vague understanding of the impacts of CBT on sustainability. This study employs a social entrepreneurship perspective to explore CBT practices and their relationship with sustainable development in coastal communities in Thua Thien Hue, Central Vietnam. A survey collected data on 297 households in nine villages along the provincial coast. As a collective entrepreneurial initiative, tourism appears to have reconfigured the natural and sociocultural capitals of the coastal communities. CBT had different impacts on social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Although CBT brought considerable improvements to the landscape, environment, and natural resources, it caused unexpected impacts on culture preservation. Meanwhile, CBT did not provide many local household income enhancement or job creation opportunities. The study has implications for managers and policy maker to develop CBT in developing countries.

TI  - Capacity Building Helps Pastoral Women Transform Impoverished Communities in Ethiopia
T2  - SCIENCE
AB  - Poverty, drought, and hunger devastate people on Africa's rangelands. We used an action-oriented approach from 2000 to 2004 to build capacity among thousands of pastoralists to diversify livelihoods, improve living standards, and enhance livestock marketing. The process included collective action, microfinance, and participatory education. Poor women previously burdened by domestic chores became leaders and rapidly changed their communities. Drought occurred from 2005 to 2008. We assessed intervention effects on household drought resilience with a quasiexperimental format that incorporated survey-based comparisons of treatment groups with ex post controls. Interventions led to major improvements in trends for quality of life, wealth accumulation, hunger reduction, and risk management. Human capacity building can be a driver for change, generating hope and aspirations that set the stage for the use of new information and technology.

TI  - Farmer Heterogeneity and Land Transfer Decisions Based on the Dual Perspectives of Economic Endowment and Land Endowment
T2  - LAND
AB  - Guiding qualified farmers to transfer their land is an important way to alleviate the problem of land abandonment, improve land use efficiency, and achieve moderately large-scale land management. Based on the dual perspectives of economic endowment and land endowment, this paper uses the 2015 data of the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), using the semilogarithmic ordinary least-squares method and the logit model, to explore differences in land transfer decisions under the effect of farmer heterogeneity. The circulation trading market was further improved to provide a reference. The heterogeneity of economic endowment and land endowment significantly affects the decision-making behavior of farmers in transferring land. The higher the land endowment is, the greater the probability that farmers transfer the land out and successfully trade, and they are more inclined to transfer the cultivated land to cooperatives, village collectives, and other institutions through formal channels, leading to a higher unit income of the transfer. Further research shows that land endowment has no significant difference in the impact of land endowment on whether farmers with different livelihood endowments transfer their land, but under the same land endowment, farmers with economic endowment advantages are more able to use their own endowment advantages to transfer their land out through formal channels and obtain higher gains income. Therefore, focusing on improving the conditions of land resources and increasing the endowment of farmers are important means to promote successful transactions in the land transfer market, ensure its sustainable operation, and promote further increase in the income of transfer farmers.

TI  - Building adaptive capacity to external risks through collective action - Social learning mechanisms of smallholders in rural Vietnam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
AB  - Adaptation to various socio-economic risks attendant to climate change represents an increasing challenge for agrarian populations across the Global South. Rural households mitigate risks through both individual and collective strategies that have proven viable for establishing long-term adaptive capacities. However, while the importance of social interactions has been acknowledged, there has been little in-depth empirical research on the influence of collective structures on vulnerable livelihoods. Based on research with smallholders in rural Vietnam, this paper explores how social capital deployed through informal collective actions compares with the effects of formal collective organisations for the overall adaptive capacity. We apply a mixed-methods approach combining a rich survey dataset from three rural provinces, and qualitative interviews with farmers in four case study villages. The results reveal the emergence of informal and semi-formalised collective actions in farming practices as synergistic supplements to existing formal structures and institutions through mechanisms of social learning.

TI  - Dairy farming, cooperatives and livelihoods: lessons learned from six indian villages
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN ECONOMICS
AB  - India's dairy sector has emerged as the world's largest dairy producer and has enabled 70 million farmers to generate income through its rapid growth. This success is linked to broad national policy support through the Operation Flood program and the emergence of an inclusive model of cooperatives. However, the informal sector is still the marketing channel most used by dairy producers, and with the liberalization of the dairy sector, the cooperative model is also facing competition from the private sector. By surveying 244 dairy farmers in two major but heterogeneous states in India, this paper examines the inclusiveness of the sector and the impact of dairy cooperative membership on farmers' income and livelihood. The originality of the paper concerns its systematic perspective on households' assets and activities. The results indicate that cooperative membership is associated with caste membership and farmers collection centers. Better incomes are associated with membership, particularly among farmers with less land and among smallholders, who are more dependent on their dairy income to lift themselves out of poverty.

TI  - Drivers of perceived land tenure (in)security: Empirical evidence from Ghana
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Tenure security is believed to be critical in spurring agricultural investment and productivity. Yet what improves or impedes tenure security is still poorly understood. Using household-and plot-level data from Ghana, this study analyses the main factors associated with farmers' perceived tenure security. Individually, farmers perceive greater tenure security on plots acquired via inheritance than on land allocated by traditional authorities. Collectively, however, perceived tenure security lessens in communities with more active land markets and economic vibrancy. Plots held by migrant households and women in polygamous households are perceived as less tenure secure, while farmers with political connections are more confident about their tenure security.

TI  - Coastal livelihood transitions: Socio-economic consequences of changing mangrove forest management and land allocation in a commune of Central Vietnam
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH
CP  - Workshop on Land Degradation and Poverty
AB  - This paper reviews the evolution of land use and mangrove forest management in a coastal commune in Central Vietnam from its early period of environmentally sound management under a common property regime, through State and cooperative management, to individual household allocation under the economic reforms of the 1990s. It analyses in particular the introduction of shrimp culture and its environmental and socioeconomic consequences. The case study demonstrates that, while opening up many economic opportunities, Vietnam's economic reforms have had uneven impacts on income inequality. Like many cases in Asia and Latin America, the disruption of common property resources - through the introduction of aquaculture as a livelihood opportunity and producer of an export crop - leaves farmers indebted and natural resources polluted. But, ironically, it was the financially better-off aquaculture farmers, who had more capacity for risk-taking and investing, who ended up most indebted, in comparison with poorer farmers who had already sold their ponds. The latter were less integrated into the market economy and relied more on marine product collection. This paper suggests that attention to local contexts and histories can contribute to a better understanding of the causes and consequences of environment-poverty interfaces.

T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Due to its controversies, oil palm cultivation has been targeted by regulatory innovations. Among these, transnational efforts-such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and corporate commitments to zero deforestation have been highly influential but often tend to overvalue environmental over socio-economic outcomes. This article discusses to what extent domestic governance models of palm oil producing countries can be better equipped to reconcile domestic demands such as economic development and poverty alleviation, and transnational concerns about forest conservation. We do so by looking into the Brazilian case, where the government intended to drive oil palm expansion in the Amazon through a program launched in 2010 that simultaneously only allowed expansion into already deforested areas and offered companies incentives to engage smallholder farmers in their supply chains. Our findings, drawn from primary research activities and existing literature, indicate that Brazil has managed to avoid deforestation typically associated with oil palm expansion elsewhere. Oil palm establishment involved the conversion of 0.8% and 1.3% of primary forests for corporate and smallholder plantations, respectively. However, the Brazilian government did not manage to optimally enhance smallholder participation in the sector, as significant differences in performance were observed between farmers, ranging from very successful (17%) to highly unsuccessful (12%); and failed to achieve sectoral development and competitiveness targets. While some failings can be attributed to external factors such as context, broader domestic governance frameworks and alignments, and private supply chain initiatives, the program itself did not manage to reconcile social, environmental and economic objectives into a single coherent sectoral governance model. Yet, this case study suggests that domestic governance strategies can enable commodity production in a way that is more coherent with national priorities, at the same time as preventing deforestation and minimizing social risks more effectively.

TI  - The Effect of Farmland Transfer on the Technical Efficiency of Farm Households in China: An Empirical Result of External Environmental Factors
T2  - LAND
AB  - In the context of food security, the market-oriented allocation of factors under the collective ownership system has had a profound impact on agricultural production. As a hot issue under the Household Responsibility System (HRS), the impact mechanism of farmland market transaction on agricultural production efficiency deserves discussion. Based on the stochastic frontier production function model, this paper analyzes the impact of farmland transfer on farmers' production technical efficiency under the external environmental factors by using the moderating effect and threshold effect. The study found that farmland transfer can improve farmers' technical efficiency. The market price of agricultural products and farmland transfer subsidies have a positive moderating effect on the impact of farmland transfer on technical efficiency. Furthermore, farmland transfer subsidy shows a nonlinear effect on the impact of technical efficiency.

TI  - Protecting patients with cardiovascular diseases from catastrophic health expenditure and impoverishment by health finance reform
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - ObjectivesTo compare the incidences of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and impoverishment, the risk protection offered by two health financial reforms and to explore factors associated with CHE and impoverishment among patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in rural Inner Mongolia, China.
   MethodsCross-sectional study conducted in 2014 in rural Inner Mongolia, China. Patients with CVDs aged over 18 years residing in the sample areas for at least one year were eligible. The definitions of CHE and impoverishment recommended by WHO were adopted. The protection of CHE and impoverishment was compared between the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) alone and NCMS plus National Essential Medicines Scheme (NEMS) using the percentage change of incidences for CHE and impoverishment. Logistic regression was used to explore factors associated with CHE and impoverishment.
   ResultsThe incidences of CHE and impoverishment under NCMS plus NEMS were 11.26% and 3.30%, respectively, which were lower than those under NCMS alone. The rates of protection were higher among households with patients with CVDs covered by NCMS plus NEMS (25.68% and 34.65%, respectively). NCMS plus NEMS could protect the poor households more from CHE but not impoverishment. NCMS plus NEMS protected more than one-fourth of households from CHE and more than one-third from impoverishment.
   ConclusionNCMS plus NEMS was more effective at protecting households with patients with CVDs from CHE and impoverishment than NCMS alone. An integration of NCMS with NEMS should be expanded. However, further strategies to minimise catastrophic health expenditure after this health finance reform are still needed.

TI  - Social influence and collective action effects on farm level soil conservation effort in rural Kenya
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper analyzes the effects of social influence and participation in collective action initiatives on soil conservation effort among smallholder farmers in Lake Naivasha basin, Kenya. We apply binary and ordered probit models in a two stage regression procedure to cross-sectional data collected through a household survey among randomly selected smallholder farmers. Smallholder farming systems in the research area are associated with practices that render farmlands susceptible to soil erosion causing negative impacts on land and the environment. Therefore, strategies that encourage soil conservation are likely to also offer solutions for dealing with agri-environmental challenges and poverty alleviation. Results indicate that social capital facilitates participation in collective action initiatives which then influence individual soil conservation efforts. Neighborhood social influences, subjective norms, gender, education level, farm size, access to credit and livestock ownership also emerge as key determinants of soil conservation effort. Policy implications drawn by this study encourage strategies to increase participation and effectiveness in collective action initiatives as a boost to soil conservation. Implementation of soil conservation practices could also be encouraged through awareness increasing instruments, facilitating access to agricultural micro-credit and paying attention to gender related challenges on knowledge access and rights over land and other natural resources.

TI  - Intra-household bargaining over household technology adoption
T2  - REVIEW OF ECONOMICS OF THE HOUSEHOLD
AB  - We examine the barriers to adoption of improved cook stoves (ICSs) in rural India, using a large, nationally representative dataset. We develop a collective household model to derive testable hypotheses about whether women's intra-household influence, together with their relatively strong marginal preference for ICSs, affects adoption. Using a joint adoption-influence econometric model, we find compelling evidence that women's influence over intra-household decisions significantly increases adoption. We further distinguish between alternative sources of women's influence, and argue that our distinction has potential implications for ICS dissemination policies. We find that while there is significant variation in women's influence across rural India due to cultural and other sociological factors, the effect of intra-household influence on adoption has a significant bargaining power component. Our results suggest that ICS programs may be able to increase adoption by marketing stoves in ways that empower women.

TI  - The influence of the rural health security schemes on health utilization and household impoverishment in rural China: data from a household survey of western and central China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB  - Background: The New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS, voluntary health insurance) and the Medical Financial Assistance (MFA, financial relief program) were established in 2003 for rural China. The aim of this study was to document their coverage, assess their effectiveness on access to in-patient care and protection against financial catastrophe and household impoverishment due to health spending, and identify the factors predicting impoverishment with and without these schemes.
   Methods: A cross-sectional household survey was conducted in 2008 in Hebei and Shaanxi provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region using a multi-stage sampling technique. Information on personal demographic characteristics, chronic illness status, health care use, household expenditure, and household health spending were collected by interview.
   Results: NRCMS covered 90.8% of the studied individuals and among the designated poor, 7.6% had their premiums paid by MFA. Of those referred for hospitalization in the year prior to the interview, 34.3% failed to comply, mostly (80.2%) owing to financial constraints. There was no significant difference in the unmet need for admission between the insured with NRCMS and the uninsured. Before reimbursement, the incidence of catastrophic health payment (household health spending more than 40% of household's capacity to pay) and medical impoverishment (household per capita income falling below the poverty line due to medical expense) was 14.3% and 8.2%, respectively. NRCMS prevented 9.9% of the households from financial catastrophe and 7.7% from impoverishment, whereas MFA kept just one household from impoverishment and had no effect on financial catastrophe. Household per capita expenditure and household chronic disease proportion (proportion of members of a household with chronic illness) were the most important determinants of the unmet need for admission, risk of being impoverished and the chance of not being saved from impoverishment.
   Conclusion: The coverage of NRCMS among the rural population was high but not adequate to improve access to in-patient care and protect against financial catastrophe and household impoverishment due to health payment, especially for the poor and the chronically ill. Furthermore, MFA played almost no such role; therefore, the current schemes need to be improved.

TI  - Under regional characteristics of rural China: a clearer view on the performance of the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) was implemented in 2003 in response to the poor state of health care in rural China. Considering the substantial differences in regional socioeconomics, preferences for health care needs, and concurrent implementation of other health-related policies, the extent to which the impact of the NCMS differs in rural communities across China is unclear. The objective of this paper, therefore, was to explore the variation in the determinants of household enrolment and the impact of enrolment on health care utilization and medical expenditures in three large geographic regions in China. A quasi-experiment study was designed based on the panel data of the China Health and Nutrition Survey. The bounding approach was used to conduct a robust check of impact estimation under the assumption of unobserved bias. A major finding is that household income plays no significant role for enrolment, which indicates the equity of program coverage in income terms. However, regional circumstances matter. In the generally poorer western regions, households with a high ratio of migrant workers are less attracted to the NCMS program, and adoption of the program is related to the regional infrastructure environment variables in the eastern and western regions. The NCMS has improved medical care utilization for poor income groups and regions (western regions). The NCMS's impact on reducing the incidence of catastrophic expenditures is not shown for all regions.

TI  - Profitability of rice production in different production systems in Ebonyi State, Nigeria
T2  - OPEN AGRICULTURE
AB  - Profitability of rice production in different production systems in Ebonyi State, Nigeria was evaluated. Rice is critical for food security in Nigeria, hence, farmers need to make appropriate choices of rice production systems to optimize production and ensure an adequate domestic supply. This study used 2015 survey data from rice farming households. Rice farmers in swamp, lowland and upland rice production systems showed variability in profit. Swamp production systems had the highest return per hectare (29.37%) followed by lowland production systems (20.10%) and upland production systems (13.03%). Poor access to production credit and climate change were constraints to rice production in the area. Rice production using the swamp production system is profitable and would ensure increased production and higher returns to the farmers. It is recommended that farmers should form cooperative groups to enable them to pool resources together to boost their production.

TI  - Does Participation in Aquaculture Cooperatives Increase Farmers ' Profit and Output?
T2  - FISHES
AB  - Individual aquaculture farmers in developing countries play an important role in ensuring food security. This study uses survey data from aquaculture households in Rongcheng and Xiangshan cities in China to explore the impact of cooperative participation on the benefits to the aquaculture households. The empirical results show that the participation of aquaculture farmers in cooperatives has effectively increased their net profit and output per unit area. On average, participating in cooperatives increased the net profit and output per unit area of farmers by approximately 15.55% and 11.47%, respectively. The test results of the mechanism show that the information services, technical training, and product sales guidance provided by the cooperatives have increased the net profit of the farmers. At the same time, the information services and product sales guidance provided by cooperatives are important reasons for the increase in the output per unit area.

TI  - The environmental effects of sugarcane expansion: A case study of changes in land and water use in southern Africa
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Sugarcane is often portrayed as one of the most environmentally sustainable food and energy crops, yet evidence of the crop's social and environmental impacts in Africa's growing sugarcane industry remains scarce. The land cover replaced by cane and subsequent land use practices play important roles in shaping the environmental impacts of expansion. Land cover change can be both direct and indirect and land ownership is key in shaping socioeconomic impacts, yet these have not been systematically documented in an area experiencing cane expansion in Africa. This paper addresses these gaps through an analysis of land use changes and hydrological impacts associated with the 2006 to 2012 expansion of Zambia Sugar in Mazabuka, Zambia. Methods included semi-structured interviews with Zambia Sugar and outgrowers, remote sensing of land cover to quantify the types of land conversion, and hydrological analysis of impacts on regional crop water use and the Kafue River. The bulk of the expansion area as reported by Zambia Sugar (62%) converted low-water using shrublands to sugarcane, increasing total consumptive use of irrigation water by cane in Mazabuka to 13-16% of the 25% probability monthly mean low flow in the Kafue River. Commercial-scale growers represented 94% of the expansion area, calling into question claims about smallholder inclusion.

TI  - Determinants of repayment performance of group lending in China Evidence from rural credit cooperatives' program in Guizhou province
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper aims to explore how borrower and group-level characteristics affect repayment decisions of group borrowers by highlighting the case of rural credit cooperatives (RCCs) in Guizhou province in Southwest China.
   Design/methodology/approach - The Logit model was applied to test the determinants of repayment performance of RCCs' group lending. The authors used the survey data of 245 farm households in Guizhou province, collected in 2008.
   Findings - The empirical results indicate that there is a serious mismatch between joint liability mechanisms and the social and economic conditions in rural China. Mechanisms such as threatening to withhold defaulters' future loans from RCCs failed to work. In addition, higher household incomes also did not improve repayment performance. However, factors such as a higher degree of acquaintanceship in a group, migrant income, and employment in government agencies, positively improved the chances of repayment.
   Practical implications - Group lending is more suitable for poorer areas with few opportunities for migration and limited access to finance. In addition, constructing the trustworthy relationship between micro-lenders and customers and designing diverse and flexible financial services to meet heterogeneous demands are equally important.
   Originality/value - This paper is an attempt to empirically explore the determinants of repayment performance in group lending programs in China. The results provide meaningful policy implications for the government and rural financial institutions.

TI  - Ganyu casual labour, famine and HIV/AIDS in rural Malawi: causality and casualty
T2  - JOURNAL OF MODERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - Over the past ten years, Malawian peasant farming households have endured a number of material and life-threatening setbacks. The absence of subsidised fertiliser loans to farmers continues to trouble villagers a decade after their removal. Yields of both food and cash crops have been declining. Farming households' earnings from agricultural exports and remittances have decreased. The creeping and then intensified incidence of HIV/AIDS infection has led to widespread debility and death, compounded by a serious famine in 2001-03. During the famine and its aftermath, ganyu casual labour gained in importance as a source of income, especially for women and youth from poor rural households. Field evidence suggests that the highly exploitative contractual terms that employers offered widened the gap between the haves and have-nots, and fuelled the risks of contracting HIV/AIDS. Ganyu, representing an established form of labour based on mutual economic benefit between exchange agents stretching back over a century, has become synonymous with degradation and despair for the working poor.

TI  - Resolving risk? Marriage and creative conjugality
T2  - DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
AB  - The idea of rural women as risk-averse food producers has been powerful and persistent and constitutes one of our most enduring generalizations. This contribution begins with some critical thoughts about the prevalent consensus on women and risk behaviour and goes on to discuss some counter examples of risk-taking women farmers in Zimbabwe and Zambia. It argues that risk behaviours of these kinds are strongly related to the character of marriage and forms of conjugality, and considers more broadly how insurance and dependence are gendered. There is a danger of overdrawing, and exclusively emphasizing, household and marriage as sites of gender subordination and thereby losing sight of the value to women of domestic groups and the existence of class-based solidarities and emotional investments, across gender, which are intertwined with gender subordinations. To recognize these (and other) positive aspects of institutions of kinship and marriage, without simultaneously endorsing subordination, requires a focus on change and women's agency within such institutions, and the happy thought that there is no such thing as the status quo. This study therefore considers myths made within different but overlapping contexts; first the idea of women as reliably risk averse (as well as disadvantaged in access to insurance) which holds sway in international development organizations and some gender analysis; and second, the myth of households as composed of entirely separate individuals with opposed gender interests, in which marriage is predominantly a contract legitimating the exploitation of women. Marriage works as a safety net for women in many contexts, as a form of insurance, but it may become an impediment to accumulation - a feature shared with other social security institutions.

TI  - National and International Policies and Policy Instruments in the Development of Agroforestry in Chad
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The potential of agroforestry to improve livelihoods and mitigate climate change and environmental degradation has been widely recognized, especially within the context of climate-smart agriculture. However, agroforestry opportunities have not been fully exploited because of several reasons, among which are adverse policies and legislations. However, many countries do not have a full understanding of how their policy and institutional environment may affect agroforestry development. We aim to fill this gap by looking at the particular case of Chad. The method used included examining data from: (i) literature reviews of important national and international polices, strategies, and legislation governing access to land and trees, among which are 'La Loi 14', Chad's 2010 poverty reduction strategy paper, draft zero of the National Environmental Policy, (ii) interviews and focus group discussions with NGOs, government officials, and farmers, and (iii) surveys with 100 households. Results show that Chad has no specific agroforestry policy but opportunities for agroforestry can be found in some of the above-mentioned policy documents and government strategies. Most stakeholders interviewed had positive attitudes towards agroforestry, but uptake of the practice is handicapped by poor understanding of the forestry law by farmers and forestry officials. Gaps in existing laws give room for rent-seekers to collect individual (USD 272-909) and collective (USD 36-1818) access fees to trees on both forest and farmland. We propose that the government of Chad should unmask elements of agroforestry in existing policies and policy instruments to demonstrate its importance in responding to livelihood and environmental challenges in the country.

TI  - Collective Dairy Farming, Women Empowerment and Social Inclusion: A Village-Level Study from Bihar, India
T2  - GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - Using the theory of change, the study captures how the dairy cooperative societies (DCS)-level activities under National Dairy Plan 1 (NDP I) have promoted women's empowerment and social inclusion in rural societies. We use the case study method, in-depth interviews and informal talks to gather information from the women dairy farmers. We propose that dairy farmers under NDP-I have improved their socio-economic conditions, and dairy farming has increased the intra-household bargaining power of the farmer women. This article examines the role of the DCSs in improving the socio-economic status of weaker sections, including women and lower-caste people (Bihar, India). We find that social inclusion has been a regular practice at the DCS level, promoting a diversified social relationship among rural women. The findings highlight the process of change that has enhanced women's agency to decide and act upon them at both the household and community level. The study captures the very process of change that empowers the weaker sections of rural Bihar. Earlier studies hardly have tried to understand the empowerment process through the lenses of 'theory of change'.

TI  - Institutions and Financial Inclusion in Rural Uganda: the Mediating Role of Social Capital
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN BUSINESS
AB  - The study examined the mediating role of social capital in the relationship between institutions and financial inclusion of poor households in rural Uganda. Cross-sectional design was adopted and data were collected and analyzed using SPSS/20, MedGraph and Sobel-z test. The findings indicated that social capital partially mediates the relationship between institutions and financial inclusion. Besides, institutions and financial inclusion are significantly related. Thus, managers of financial institutions, financial inclusion working groups, and policy makers should pay more attention to the role of social capital in promoting cooperative behavior among the poor in accessing scarce resources such as financial services.

TI  - Drivers of Change in Hunter Offtake and Hunting Strategies in Sendje, Equatorial Guinea
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Economic development in Africa is expected to increase levels of bushmeat hunting through rising demand for meat and improved transport infrastructure. However, few studies have tracked long-term changes in hunter behavior as a means of testing this prediction. We evaluated changes in hunter behavior in a rural community in Equatorial Guinea over a period of rapid national economic growth, during which time road access to the regional capital greatly improved. We conducted offtake surveys (Supporting Information) over 3 7-week periods at the same time of year in 1998, 2003, and 2010 and conducted hunter and household interviews (Supporting Information) in 2003 and 2010. We tested whether relations existed among catch, hunting effort, hunting strategy, and income earned through hunting and other livelihoods in 2003 and 2010. Although village offtake increased from 1775 kg in 1998 to 4172 kg in 2003, it decreased in 2010 to 1361 kg. Aggregate catch per unit effort (i.e., number of carcasses caught per hunter and per trap) decreased from 2003 to 2010, and the majority of hunters reported a decrease in abundance of local fauna. Although these results are indicative of unsustainable hunting, cumulative changes in offtake and catch per unit effort were driven by a contraction in the total area hunted following an out-migration of 29 of the village's hunters, most of whom left to gain employment in the construction industry, after 2003. Hunters operating in both 2003 and 2010 hunted closer to the village because an increased abundance of elephants posed a danger and because they desired to earn income through other activities. Our study provides an example of national economic development contributing to a reduction in the intensity and extent of hunting.

TI  - Intended and unintended environmental consequences of grassland rental in pastoral China

AB  - Among herders, market-oriented grassland rental has been prevalent in China following the implementation of the Household Contracted Responsibility System, which allocated formerly collectively-owned use rights to in-dividual herders. However, empirical evidence on the effect of grassland rental on herder households? over-grazing behaviour is scant, despite the fact that it is one of the main determinants of the severe grassland degradation in China. This study thus investigates the effects of grassland rental on both household-and plot-level grazing intensity and overgrazing based on a survey of 876 plots and 516 households in the Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and Gansu provinces in China. An instrumental variable approach is utilised to correct the endogeneity bias of herders? decision to rent in grassland. The household-level empirical results show that each 1000-mu increment of rent-in grassland leads to an intended 42% decrease in the overall grazing intensity and a 61% decrease in the overgrazing index. However, a plot-level analysis pooling both rent-in and self-owned grassland plots reveals the unintended consequence that herders are over-exploiting rent-in grassland plots; as a result, the grazing intensity on rent-in grassland is 2.03 times that on owned grassland. Therefore, grassland rental should be encouraged, but the monitoring system should pay more attention to the overgrazing of rental grassland.

TI  - Do Farmers Value Insurance Against Extreme Droughts and Floods? Evidence from Odisha, India
T2  - GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - Crop insurance provides farmers with financial support and coverage in the event of extreme natural disasters. Despite more than two decades of disseminating the knowledge in India, crop insurance adoption rates remain low with evidence of dis-adoption. This article assesses farm households' willingness to insure their crops as well as ability to pay for an insurance product designed to help rural Indian farmers manage flood- and drought-associated risks. The objective of this study is to assess the determinants of farmers' participation in market-based agricultural insurance living in coastal and rainfed areas prone to risky weather. It is hypothesized that crop insurance would lead to less risk-averse behaviour and more efficient use of farm resources. Using probit model, the study highlights several determinants of willingness to insure and empirically verify the role of risk aversion in insurance purchase decisions. The lottery-choice experiment has been applied by the author for evaluating risk attitudes of sample household. Empirical results suggest that as regards farmers' risk preferences, risk aversion actually plays an important role even though not directly but in interactive terms with expected losses which, in turn, significantly influencing farmers' willingness to purchase the insurance product. The study underlines significant influence of insurance history on future crop insurance choice decision. Farmers' insurance purchase history can help insurance companies, in order to devise effective crop insurance programmes in the future. Similarly, the study also foregrounds the significant role of insured amount in insurance contracts, influencing farmers' crop insurance purchase decision in both rainfed and irrigated regions. It can therefore help insurance companies to revise the contract items or reform the existing subsidies. Finally, the study goes on to recommend the importance of the knowledge of informal risk management strategies followed by farmers before offering them the formal insurance product and the necessity of the insurance companies in understanding the farmers' behaviour while designing the insurance product.

TI  - Fairtrade, Agrochemical Input Use, and Effects on Human Health and the Environment
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - It is often assumed that voluntary sustainability standards - such as Fairtrade - could not only improve the socioeconomic wellbeing of smallholder farmers in developing countries but could also help to reduce negative health and environmental impacts of agricultural production. The empirical evidence is thin, as most previous studies on the impact of sustainability standards only focused on economic indicators, such as prices, yields, and incomes. Here, we argue that Fairtrade and other sustainability standards can affect agrochemical input use through various mechanisms with possible positive and negative health and environmental effects. We use data from farmers and rural workers in Cote d'Ivoire to analyze effects of Fairtrade certification on fertilizer and pesticide use, as well as on human health and environmental toxicity. Fairtrade increases chemical input quantities and aggregated levels of toxicity. Nevertheless, Fairtrade reduces the incidence of pesticide-related acute health symptoms among farmers and workers. Certified cooperatives are more likely to offer training and other services related to the safe handling of pesticides and occupational health, which can reduce negative externalities in spite of higher input quantities. These results suggest that simplistic assumptions about the health and environmental effects of sustainability standards may be inappropriate.

TI  - Rural Household Preferences for Active Participation in "Payment for Ecosystem Service" Programs: A Case in the Miyun Reservoir Catchment, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Many payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs, such as the Slope Land Conversion Program (SLCP), are passive and require full participation by impacted households. In contrast, this study considers the alternative of "active and incomplete" participation in PES programs, in which participants are not obliged to contract their own land, and have the right to select into the program or not. This type of program has been popular over the last decade in China; however, there have been few studies on the characteristics of willingness to participate and implementation. As such, this paper uses the Choice Experiment (CE) method to explore ways for inducing effective program participation, by analyzing the effects of different regime attributes. The case study used to analyze participation utility was the Jing-Ji Afforestation Program for Ecological and Water Protection (JAPEWP), a typical active-participation forestry PES program, and a key source of water near Beijing in the Miyun Reservoir Catchment (MRC). Analyzing rural household survey data indicated that the program faces a variety of challenges, including long-term maintenance, implementation performance, costeffectiveness, and monitoring approaches. There are also challenges with one-size-fits-all payment strategies, due to ineffective program participation or imperfect implementation regimes. In response, this study proposes several policies, including providing secure and complete land tenure to the participants, creating more local off-farm employment opportunities, designing performance-based monitoring systems that are integrated with financial incentives, applying differentiated payment strategies, providing capacity building to support forestation activities, and establishing a comprehensive implementation regime that would address these challenges. These policy conclusions provide valuable lessons for other active-participation PES programs as well.

TI  - Does the new cooperative medical scheme reduce inequality in catastrophic health expenditure in rural China?
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: In 2003, the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) was introduced in China to re-establish health insurance for the country's vast rural population. In addition, the coverage of NCMS has been expanding after the new health care reform launched in 2009. This study aims to examine whether the NCMS and its recent expansion have reached the goal of reducing the risk and inequality of catastrophic health spending for rural residents in China.
   Methods: We conducted a face-to-face household survey in three counties of the Shandong province in 2009 and 2012. Using this unique panel data, we examined the changes in the incidence and intensity of catastrophic health expenditures (CHEs) before and after NCMS reimbursement. We used concentration index (CI) and decomposition method to study the changes in inequality in CHEs.
   Results: We found that NCMS reimbursement played a role of reducing both the incidence and intensity of CHEs, and that this impact was stronger after the new health care reform was launched. After reimbursement, the concentration indices for CHEs were 0.073 and 0.021 in 2009 and 2012, indicating that the rich had a greater tendency to incur CHEs and there existed less inequality in the incidence of CHEs after reimbursement in 2012 compared with 2009. The decomposition analysis results suggested that changes in CHE inequality between 2009 and 2012 were attributed to changes in economic status and household size rather than reimbursement levels.
   Conclusions: Our results indicated that inequality was shrinking from 2009 to 2012, which could be a result of fewer rich people having CHEs in 2012 compared with 2009. The impact of NCMS in alleviating the financial burden of rural residents was still limited, especially among the poor. Health care reform policies in China that aim to reduce CHEs must continue to place an emphasis on improving reimbursement, cost containment, and reducing income inequalities.

TI  - Barriers or enablers? Chiefs, elite capture, disasters, and resettlement in rural Malawi
T2  - DISASTERS
AB  - Chiefs are at the centre of household and community development efforts in most low-income countries around the world. Yet, researchers and scholars have paid limited attention to the institution of chieftaincy and to understanding its role in the management of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. This paper draws on a micro ethnographic evaluation conducted in two predominantly rural districts of Malawi in southeast Africa to assess two different manifestations of elite control. In the first case, a resettlement programme was implemented where chiefs were co-opted and took the lead. In the second case, a food insecurity response programme was designed to exclude chiefs. The study finds that neither co-opting nor countering chiefs prevents elite capture. Rather, the majority of chiefs oscillate between malevolent and benevolent capture. The findings require that states focus on the cultural and political dimensions of rural life when designing climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction programmes.

TI  - Does contract farming improve rice yield In Ghana?
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - Contract farming has gained grounds in Ghana's rice production sub-sector but there is no conclusive evidence on whether or not the model improves rice yield. This study sought to identify factors influencing farmers' decision to participate in contract farming. Also, it estimated the effects of contract farming on rice yield. The study used a cross-sectional data. Heckman sample selection model was used to estimate the effects of contract farming on rice yield. The study showed that education, irrigation, extension contact and improved seed positively influenced contract farming engagement. Farming experience and farm size had negative relationship with contract farming engagement. Whilst fertilizer, capital, irrigation, improved seed and contract farming engagement highly increased rice yield, seed, labour and household size negatively affected yield. Conclusively, contract farming improves rice yield. It is recommended that farmers should be encouraged to go into contract farming. Extension service intensification and education are critical in this regard. The efforts of government in providing subsidized fertilizer and improved seeds to farmers through planting for food and jobs programme should be enhanced through contractual arrangement and the use of nucleus-farmer-out-grower model. The one-village-one-dam policy of government should include the establishment of irrigation facilities.

TI  - Socioeconomic inequalities in food insecurity and malnutrition among under-five children: within and between-group inequalities in Zimbabwe
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background Food insecurity and malnutrition in children are pervasive public health concerns in Zimbabwe. Previous studies only identified determinants of food insecurity and malnutrition with very little efforts done in assessing related inequalities and decomposing the inequalities across household characteristics in Zimbabwe. This study explored socioeconomic inequalities trend in child health using regression decomposition approach to compare within and between group inequalities. Methods The study used Demographic Health Survey (DHS) data sets of 2010\11 and 2015. Food insecurity in under-five children was determined based on the WHO dietary diversity score. Minimum dietary diversity was defined by a cut- off point of > 4 therefore, children with at least 3 of the 13 food groups were defined as food insecure. Malnutrition was assessed using weight for age (both acute and chronic under-nutrition) Z-scores. Children whose weight-for-age Z-score below minus two standard deviations (- 2 SD) from the median were considered malnourished. Concentration curves and indices were computed to understand if malnutrition was dominant among the poor or rich. The study used the Theil index and decomposed the index by population subgroups (place of residence and socioeconomic status). Results Over the study period, malnutrition prevalence increased by 1.03 percentage points, while food insecurity prevalence decreased by 4.35 percentage points. Prevalence of malnutrition and food insecurity increased among poor rural children. Theil indices for nutrition status showed socioeconomic inequality gaps to have widened, while food security status socioeconomic inequality gaps contracted for the period under review. Conclusion The study concluded that unequal distribution of household wealth and residence status play critical roles in driving socioeconomic inequalities in child food insecurity and malnutrition. Therefore, child food insecurity and malnutrition are greatly influenced by where a child lives (rural/urban) and parental wealth.

TI  - Institutional Regime, Off-Farm Employment, and the Interaction Effect: What are the Determinants of Households' Forestland Transfer in China?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The development of the land rental market has been widely attributed to the associated institutional regime and the functioning of the off-farm labor market. However, little is known of the interaction effect of these two factors. To fill this gap, we employ a nationwide representative household dataset to investigate the effects of China's collective forest tenure reform (CFTR) and off-farm employment on forestland transfer in China. Special interest is focused on their potential interaction effect. The Smith-Blundell instrumental variable tobit model is adopted to account for the endogeneity of off-farm employment. The estimation results show that both the tenure reform and off-farm employment significantly influence forestland transactions. However, compared to the positive effect of the reform on both renting in and renting out forestland, the effect of off-farm employment is mixed, that is, its effect is negative when forestland is rented in but positive on rent-out decisions. An important finding is that the CFTR imposes a negative enhancement effect on forestland rent-in through its interaction term with off-farm employment. In contrast, the enhancement effect on rent-out is not statistically significant, which may be due to the neutralization by the endowment effect of the CFTR.

TI  - Using the Women Empowerment in Livestock Index (WELI) to Examine Linkages between Women Smallholder Livestock Farmers' Empowerment and Access to Livestock Vaccines in Machakos County of Kenya: Insights and Critiques
T2  - VACCINES
AB  - Livestock diseases are a major barrier to productivity for both male and female livestock keepers in Africa. In Kenya, two of the most devastating livestock diseases are Newcastle Disease (ND) in poultry and Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP) in goats. Female livestock keepers tend to own more small ruminants (goats, sheep, etc.) and poultry and their livelihoods are adversely affected if their herds are not vaccinated against these diseases. Livestock farming has gender specific challenges and opportunities, with implications for the empowerment of women smallholder farmers, their household well-being, food security, and livelihoods. There is a need to estimate the level to which women benefit personally, socially, and economically from keeping livestock, yet there are very few studies that can measure if livestock production does in fact empower women smallholder livestock farmers. This study was done to examine linkages between women's empowerment and access and control over livestock products and vaccines. The Women Empowerment in Livestock Index (WELI) tool, which was customized to include questions on livestock vaccine access, was used to capture baseline data on empowerment scores for women in Machakos county, Kenya, prior to implementation of animal health and vaccine test models. In total, 400 participants were surveyed in two wards of Machakos County, Kola and Kalama, which were purposively selected. Women's empowerment was mapped to three domains (3DE): intrinsic agency (power within), instrumental agency (power to), and collective agency (power with) measured against adequacy in 13 indicators. Our results indicate that the household structure (female headed or dual headed household), age of respondents and number of members in a household influence the adequacy score. Work balance was the most significant negative contributor to women's disempowerment. Women contributed the most to livestock productive activities and attained adequacy in this area compared to men, directly impacting the WELI score. Women smallholder livestock farmers report low CCPP and ND vaccination rates, minimal knowledge on livestock diseases, a lack of access to cold chain storage and rarely visited veterinarians. The WELI score was 0.81 indicating a high level of empowerment for women in this community compared to men leading us to conclude that the overall WELI score was not an accurate indicator of women's empowerment in Machakos County. However, the decomposability of the index allows us to disaggregate the drivers of change and to examine how individual indicators contribute to disempowerment.

TI  - On the road through the Bolivian Amazon: A multi-level land governance analysis of deforestation
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Previous studies have shown that collective property rights offer higher flexibility than individual property and improve sustainable community-based forest management. Our case study, carried out in the Beni department of Bolivia, does not contradict this assertion, but shows that collective rights have been granted in areas where ecological contexts and market facilities were less favourable to intensive land use. Previous experiences suggest investigating political processes in order to understand the criteria according to which access rights were distributed. Based on remote sensing and on a multi-level land governance framework, our research confirms that land placed under collective rights, compared to individual property, is less affected by deforestation among Andean settlements. However, analysis of the historical process of land distribution in the area shows that the distribution of property rights is the result of a political process based on economic, spatial, and environmental strategies that are defined by multiple stakeholders. Collective titles were established in the more remote areas and distributed to communities with lower productive potentialities. Land rights are thus a secondary factor of forest cover change which results from diverse political compromises based on population distribution, accessibility, environmental perceptions, and expected production or extraction incomes.

TI  - Determinants of adoption of sustainable production practices among smallholder coffee producers in Nicaragua
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Efforts to slow down and eventually reverse the trend of climate change will take time, and in some cases, the negative impacts of climate change will be felt long before long-term solutions to this problem can bear fruit. Adaptation and mitigation strategies constitute the front line of attack for rural households in developing countries that rely on agricultural production and natural resource use as their main source of income and growth, and whose livelihoods are threatened by climate change. This study models the determinants of adoption of sustainable production practices by coffee producers in the department of Matagalpa, in northern Nicaragua. Using primary survey data, we analyze the extent to which cooperative membership impacts adoption of ten different practices. We find that coffee farmers who belong to cooperatives have adopted sustainable practices at higher rates than non-members, and that the odds of adoption are higher for members than for non-members. A factor analysis was conducted to determine the underlying structural differences between the ten practices, and from this analysis three factors emerged and were modeled. We find that cooperative membership is a significant determinant of practices that promote water conservation, yet not significant for practices that promote soil and plant health, nor for practices related to field management. These findings are valuable for policy makers, donors, and development and extension practitioners in the coffee sector, as they can better inform and guide policies toward more efficient and effective paths of long-term climate change adaptation.

TI  - DOES CONTRACTING MAKE FARMERS HAPPY? EVIDENCE FROM SENEGAL
T2  - REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH
AB  - In this paper we use a subjective well-being approach to evaluate the welfare impact of contract-farming. We analyze the impact of contract-farming on self-reported happiness using original panel data from a farm-household survey in the Niayes region in Senegal. We use different econometric techniques and show that, when correcting for time invariant unobserved heterogeneity, contract-farming has a positive effect on subjective well-being. We find diverging effects for different types of contracts, suggesting that contract-farming contributes more to farmers' subjective well-being under certain conditions and contract design. Our main finding corroborates earlier findings from empirical studies using cross-sectional data and income-based measures of welfare. In line with earlier results from the subjective well-being literature, we find that absolute income has a positive but decreasing effect on subjective well-being while comparison income has a negative effect. Also household demographic characteristics, their land and livestock assets, and housing indicators affect subjective well-being.

TI  - Understanding the intention of smallholder farmers to adopt fish production
T2  - AQUACULTURE REPORTS
AB  - In Brazil, smallholder farmers living in rural settlements face poverty and food insecurity. To alleviate such problems, Brazilian government has used policy instruments to stimulate farmers to adopt fish production. It is expected that the adoption of fish production provides better nutrition for households and increase farmers' income. However, the adoption rate is beyond governmental expectations. A possible explanation for the low adoption rate is that policy instruments overlook how farmers in rural settlements decide to adopt novel production activities, such as fishing. Theory of planned behavior was used to deeper the understanding of how farmers can be motivated to adopt fish production. The objectives were: to identify the impact of socio-psychological constructs (i.e. attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and self-identity) on farmers' intention to adopt fish production; and to identify the salient beliefs underlying farmers' intention to adopt fish production. Results suggest that self-identity, attitude, and subjective norms impact on farmers' intention to adopt fish production. Salient behavioral beliefs that represent possible outcomes of adopting fish production were: "having an increase on farm income", "having an additional source of food for own consumption", "having a better quality of life". Salient normative beliefs that represent important others for farmers were based upon the opinion of "sons/daughters", "spouse", "friends", "neighbors", "rural cooperatives", "farmers' unions", "farmers' associations", "governmental institutions". Salient control beliefs that represent factors that would facilitate farmers to adopt fish production were: "having an easy way to sell fish production", "having financial incentive from government", "Having free technical assistance", "Having more knowledge about fish production", and "Having river water flowing in the rural lot". From a policy perspective, our results highlight the importance of interventions targeted to prime an identity of fish farmers. Interventions will also benefit from strategies to develop more favorable attitude towards adoption of fish production and to increase social support.

TI  - Bayesian approach and extreme value theory in economic analysis of forestry projects
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Reliable estimates of price and wood yield as well as the calculation of economic criteria that include uncertainty are necessary to make the decision-making process more robust when analysing a long-term activity such as forestry. Through extreme value theory EVT combined with Bayesian inference it is possible to predict probability densities for inputs used in economic evaluation criteria like wood yield and prices. With it, uncertainties regarding the inputs can be taken into account in the economic analysis, improving the way they are obtained. Therefore, this study aimed to use Bayesian approach and EVT to estimate future price and yield to carry out an economic evaluation of a forestry project. Yield, maximum and minimum price were estimated in the form of probability density. Considering 95% of probability, the NPV calculated for the minimum price situation ranged from R$ 2050.11 to R$ 5409.07 ha(-1), with a mean of R$ 3771.60 ha(-1). The NPV calculated for the maximum price situation ranged from R$ 7766.77 to R$ 9070.29 ha(-1), with a mean of R$ 8398.13 ha(-1). These results serve as best and worst-case scenarios for managers in the case of a eucalyptus plantation established in 2017 under an outgrower scheme in Brazil. The presented methodology provided good results when estimating the variables of interest. It incorporates probability levels and/or prior information. With it, the economic performance of the project and its risks are better visualized and understood by researchers and managers.

TI  - How Urban Expansion Triggers Spatio-Temporal Differentiation of Systemic Risk in Suburban Rural Areas: A Case Study of Tianjin, China
T2  - LAND
AB  - Rapid urban expansion has strongly impacted rural development in China's suburbs. The increasing probability of socio-ecosystem hazards, such as the shrinking and fragmentation of ecological space, the outflow of labor force, the disintegration of traditional society, and the decline in collective economy has become a systemic risk restricting the sustainable development of rural areas in the suburbs. At present, the influence of urban expansion on rural systemic risk in the suburbs is not clear, which is not conducive to putting forward differentiated and targeted strategies for rural revitalization. Therefore, in this study, we propose the ecological, industrial, social, and livelihood elements of rural systemic risk in the suburbs and construct a multi-dimensional risk resistance analysis framework involving functionality, stability, and sustainability. Taking 93 villages in the western suburbs of Tianjin as an example, and using spatial econometric methods such as remote sensing interpretation, GIS analysis, multiple linear regression, and random forest model testing, we analyze the relationship between external transportation construction, urban employment attraction, construction of land growth, rural risk factors, and the dimension of risk resistance. Finally, the influence of urban expansion on the spatial-temporal differentiation of rural systemic risk and the risk management strategy are discussed. The results show that the difference in the urban expansion intensities is the main factor of the spatial differentiation of rural systemic risk in the suburbs. With the acceleration of the land replacement rate between urban and rural areas, the proportion of urban construction of land is increasing, leading to various degrees of change in the rural land use pattern and the ecological security pattern. Meanwhile, because of the urban employment attraction, part of the rural labor force continues to decrease, leading to the spatial differentiation of rural industrial risks and social risks aggravated. Precise risk management strategies are put forward according to the systemic risks in different types of villages. In villages with a high proportion of urban construction land and inefficient land consolidation, ecological restoration projects should be carried out. For villages severely divided by transit roads, internal spatial connections should be strengthened by constructing public transport. For villages with good accessibility, the allocation of rural non-agricultural industries and service facilities should be strengthened to mitigate the impact of urban expansion on the rural social structure. From the perspective of risk management, the research results will provide a basis for making decisions regarding rural public policymaking and spatial resource allocation in the suburbs of developing countries.

TI  - The Impact of Cooperative Membership on Fish Farm Households' Income: The Case of Ghana
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The emergence of agricultural cooperatives is extensively viewed as a necessary institutional arrangement that can help farmers in developing countries overcome the constraints that impede them from improving sustainable agricultural production and acquiring new marketing opportunities. Therefore, this study examines the determinants of cooperative membership and its impact on fish farm household income, using data collected from two regions in Ghana. An endogenous switching regression (ESR) model is utilized to address the potential sample selection bias issue. The results show that household heads' decisions to join cooperatives are affected by their access to credit, off-farm work, education level, and peer influence. Cooperative membership can increase both household and farm income by 28.54% and 34.75%, respectively. Moreover, we show that different groups of households' cooperative impacts on farm and household income are heterogeneous. Our findings highlight the importance of cooperative patronization and provide implications that can improve households' welfare.

TI  - REDD payments as incentive for reducing forest loss
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB  - Strategies for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) could become an important part of a new agreement for climate change mitigation under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We constructed a system dynamics model for a cocoa agroforest landscape in southwestern Ghana to explore whether REDD payments are likely to promote forest conservation and what socio-economic implications would be. Scenarios were constructed for business as usual (cocoa production at the expense of forest), for payments for avoided deforestation of old-growth forest only and for payments for avoided deforestation of all forests, including degraded forest. The results indicate that in the short term, REDD is likely to be preferred by farmers when the policy focuses on payments that halt the destruction of old-growth forests only. However, there is the risk that REDD contracts may be abandoned in the short term. The likeliness of farmers to opt for REDD is much lower when also avoiding deforestation of degraded forest since this land is needed for the expansion of cocoa production. Given that it is mainly the wealthier households that control the remaining forest outside the reserves, REDD payments may increase community differentiation, with negative consequences for REDD policies.

TI  - The Impact of Drinking Water Quality and Sanitation on Child Health: Evidence from Rural Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - This paper examines the association between stored drinking water quality and sanitation on diarrhoea incidence among under-five children in Ethiopia. Using primary household survey data and microbiological water quality testing for Escherichia coli, our results show that uncontaminated stored drinking water and safe child stool disposal are associated with decreased child diarrhoea incidences of 18 and 20 percentage points, respectively. In contrast, neighbourhood concentration of pit latrine shows an increased incidence of child diarrhoea of 16 percentage points. To protect rural children from the risk of contracting diarrhoea, improving household drinking water quality and changing people's behaviour towards safe sanitation practices is needed.

TI  - Flood risk, land use and private participation in embankment maintenance in Indian Sundarbans
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper analyzes the complementarities between land productivity and conservation investments in the context of river embankment maintenance in the Indian Sundarbans. The study finds that households whose principal occupation is aquaculture commit more resources to embankment maintenance relative to those in non-aquaculture employment. While conservation efforts are greater in all types of aquaculture plots irrespective of distance from the embankments, such efforts unambiguously decrease for agricultural plots that are located at a distance from the embankments. Private returns to traditional aquaculture are much higher than returns to agriculture, enabling aquaculture households in invest in managing their local public good. However, there is evidence of free riding in canal-based aquaculture when multiple users draw water from a single source. Head-enders with greater wealth as well as intense social networks tend to free-ride while tail-enders with less land holdings contribute more towards canal maintenance. Furthermore, public intervention in embankment maintenance may be crowding out private efforts. Thus, in primarily agricultural areas, productivity-enhancing policies like adoption of salt tolerant crops with supportive extension activities may be more efficient than policies that fully subsidize public good maintenance.

TI  - Socio-ecological benefits of fine-flavor cacao in its center of origin
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB  - In the tropics, combining food security with biodiversity conservation remains a major challenge. Tropical agroforestry systems are among the most biodiversity-friendly and productive land-use systems, and 70% of cocoa is grown by >6 million smallholder farmers living on <2$ per day. In cacao's main centre of diversification, the western Amazon region, interest is growing to achieve premium prices with the conversion of high-yielding, but mostly bulk-quality cacao to native fine-flavor cacao varieties, culturally important since pre-Columbian times. Conversion to native cacao can be expected to favor adaptation to regional climate and growth conditions, and to enhance native biodiversity and ecosystem services such as biological pest control and pollination, but possibly also imply susceptibility to diseases. Experience from successful conversion of non-native cacao plantations to fine-flavor cacao agroforestry with rejuvenation by grafting and under medium-canopy cover levels (30%-40%) can ensure a smooth transition with only minor temporary productivity gaps. This includes ongoing selection programs of high yielding and disease resistant native fine-flavor cacao genotypes and organizing in cooperatives to buffer the high market volatility. In conclusion, the recent interest on converting bulk cacao to a diversity of native fine-flavor varieties in countries like Peru is a challenge, but offers promising socio-ecological perspectives.

TI  - Financial intermediation and financial inclusion of the poor: Testing the moderating role of institutional pillars in rural Uganda
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS AND SYSTEMS
AB  - Purpose Drawing from the fact that institutions act as incentives and disincentives to human behaviour in financial markets, the purpose of this study is to examine the moderating role of institutional pillars in the relationship between financial intermediation and financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda.
   Design/methodology/approach The study has used cross-sectional research design and data have been collected from the poor residing in rural Uganda. Statistical package for social sciences has been used to analyse the data. Descriptive statistics, correlations and regression analyses have been generated. Besides, ModGraph excel programme has been adopted to graphically explain the moderating role of institutional pillars in the relationship between financial intermediation and financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda.
   Findings The results reveal that institutional pillars of regulative (formal rules), normative (informal norms) and cultural cognitive (cognition) significantly moderate the relationship between financial intermediation and financial inclusion of the poor. Furthermore, the results also indicate that financial intermediation and institutional pillars have significant effects on financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda.
   Research limitations/implications The study focuses on only cross-sectional design, thus, leaving out longitudinal study. Future research using longitudinal data that explore behaviours of the poor over time could be useful. In addition, only quantitative data has been used to measure variables under study and use of qualitative data has been ignored. Thus, further studies using qualitative data are feasible.
   Practical implications Policymakers and advocates of financial inclusion in a developing country such as Uganda should adopt institutional pillars (regulative, normative and cultural-cognitive) in promoting financial intermediation in rural areas. The institutional pillars working in combination set the rule of the game or humanly devise constraints that guide economic exchange by promoting and limiting certain actions of actors in underdeveloped financial market as stipulated by North (1990) and Scott (1995).
   Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to examine the moderating role of institutional pillars under the theory of institutions in the relationship between financial intermediation and financial inclusion of the poor in a developing country setting. Indeed, institutions guide contract enforceability and information sharing in human interaction to lower the transaction costs in the financial markets. This is missing in literature and theory of financial intermediation in promoting financial inclusion, especially in rural Uganda.

TI  - Livelihood Adaptation of Rural Households under Livelihood Stress: Evidence from Sichuan Province, China
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - The welfare of many poor and low-income rural households is vulnerable to earthquakes and secondary geological disasters. The academic literature, however, pays little attention to the livelihood pressure, adaptability, and livelihood strategies of these households. Based on the survey data of 327 rural households in the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquake-stricken areas in the Sichuan Province, the livelihood pressure, adaptability, and livelihood strategy characteristics of rural households were analyzed, and the disordered multi-classification logistic regression model was constructed to explore the correlation between the above-mentioned variables. The results show that: (1) Rural households face the greatest economic pressure and the least social pressure; rural households have the strongest adaptability in social capital and the lowest adaptability in financial capital. The proportion of rural households that chose the aid livelihood strategy was the highest, while the proportion of rural households that chose the adjustment livelihood strategy was the lowest. (2) Compared with the expanded livelihood strategy, (a) When the health pressure is higher, the rural households are more inclined to choose the expanded livelihood strategy, followed by the contractive livelihood strategy and, finally, the aid livelihood strategies; (b), the higher the physical capital, the more often the rural households tend to choose the expanded livelihood strategy compared to the adjustment livelihood strategy; (c), The higher the financial capital of farm households, the more they prefer contractive livelihood strategies compared to the expanded livelihood strategy and (d), compared with the aid livelihood strategy, rural households with greater economic pressure are more inclined to choose the expanded livelihood strategy.This study can provide a reference for the establishment of relevant policies related to the adaptation capacity of rural households in the earthquake hazard zone.

TI  - Incentives, supervision, and sharecropper productivity
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - Though sharecropping remains widespread, its determinants ate still poorly understood and the debate over the extent of moral hazard is far from settled. We address both issues by analyzing the role of landlord supervision. When landlords vary in their cost of supervision, otherwise identical share-tenants can have different productivity. Unique data on monitoring frequency collected from share-tenants in rural Pakistan confirms that, controlling for selection, 'supervised' tenants are significantly more productive than unsupervised' ones. Also, landlords' decisions regarding monitoring and incentives offered to tenants depend importantly on the cost of supervision. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - "One must do, five reductions" technical practice and the economic performance of rice smallholders in the Vietnamese Mekong delta
T2  - SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB  - The "One Must Do, Five Reductions"(1M5R) program was certified in 2013, by Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, as a national approach to promoting the best management practices in lowland rice cultivation. The main idea behind 1M5R is the use of good-quality/certified seeds (the One Must Do) as well as the reduction of seed rates, pesticide use, fertilizer inputs, water use, and postharvest losses (Five Reductions). However, the impact of these farming practices is not well understood. This study employs the propensity score matching (PSM) approach to investigate the factors that affect the adoption of the 1M5R practice and to estimate this technique's impact on the economic performance of rice cultivation. Primary data were collected through a household survey of 380 rice farms in four provinces in the Mekong Delta (MKD), Vietnam. The results indicate that adopting the 1M5R technique is significantly correlated with the educational level of household heads, their memberships in paddy cooperatives, and their attendance to previous training classes. Additionally, the 1M5R technical package helps farmers to reduce their production cost by 10%, increase a paddy's selling price by 4.5% per kg, and obtain 10% more profit, compared to traditional farming households. The return on investment for adopters increased by 22%. While the findings show that a sustainable farming technique is advantageous to local farmers, they fail to present any paddy yield increase in treatment fields. To scale up this program to other areas in the MKD, well-educated farmers who are still traditional producers/non-adopters should be positively invited for training classes of the program.

TI  - Impacts of HIV/AIDS on labour allocation and agrobiodiversity depend on the stage of the epidemic: case studies in Ethiopia
T2  - NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - This paper examines the impact of HIV/AIDS on labour allocation, crop choice and agrobiodiversity in Jimma Zone, south-western Ethiopia. The study comprised a survey of 205 farm households and an in-depth analysis of four rural households. HIV/AIDS caused households to increase sharecropping their land and led to more crop species grown in the home garden. The results show that the impact of HIV/AIDS on labour allocation and crop diversity depends on the stage of the disease and on which family member is (or members are) affected. Also labour allocation plays an important role, because of the options of having sharecropping contracts or opportunities for off-farm labour. The role of land tenure system in expanding the labour allocation and income-generating options has implications for intervention strategies in the various phases of the disease, both for men and women.

TI  - Outgrower schemes, livelihoods and response pathways on the Zambian 'sugarbelt'
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - In critical agrarian studies, the connections between large-scale agricultural investments and outgrower schemes are strong, but evidence on which model produces improved livelihood outcomes remains relatively weak. This paper examines livelihood impacts in two differently structured outgrower schemes under Zambia Sugar Plc ZaSPIc, a subsidiary of Illovo Sugar Plc. The first scheme centrally controls land through an integrated company, renting out sugarcane plots to smallholders whilst acting as an intermediary. The second scheme amalgamates individual smallholder plots of land to form a contiguous block-farm managed by a ZaSPIc intermediary, integrating smallholders as shareholders. We identify the former scheme as producing greater livelihood impacts across financial capital and other dynamics but emphasise that these remain low quality and fail to produce significant path-changing gains for households. Analysis of livelihood groups and strategies, livelihood contributions of LaSAIs and sugarcane uptake, and livelihood response pathways reflect causes and consequences of differences in the evolution, operation, and integration of outgrower schemes. One outcome is the production of narrow as opposed to broad-based livelihoods. Livelihood diversification away from sugarcane schemes are forged within land-based and agrarian activities and show that smallholders do not always switch to profit maximising strategies. Our findings show that greater attention must be paid to the role of institutional arrangements and local conditions in unfolding outcomes for land and water relations, and how emerging relationships shape inclusivity of an agricultural investment. Thus, outgrower arrangements that ensure commodity production alongside alternative farmer activities that boost livelihoods are thus strengthened for this purpose.

TI  - Spatio-temporal pattern and driving mechanisms of cropland circulation in China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Land circulation is the transfer of land management rights without change of contracting and ownership rights. This is an effective solution for alleviating land fragmentation, facilitating the transfer of surplus rural labor, and improving rural income. Based on the provincial-level survey data from the Ministry of Agriculture of China, this study analyzes the spatio-temporal pattern of cropland circulation based on the cropland circulation rate (CCR), and explores the driving mechanism of cropland circulation from the perspectives of population, economy, agricultural investment, and legalization. The results showed that the CCR exhibited a polarized spatial pattern of "high value in the east and low value in the west" across China. Moreover, we observed significant spatial agglomeration of CCR, with Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai as centers of high CCR values and Sichuan and Gansu as centers of low CCR values. Furthermore, the spatial disparity of CCR showed an obviously narrowing trend during the period from 2014 to 2018. As for the circulation modes of cropland, the dominant mode in China is leasing (sub-contracting), which is easy to implement and directly increases farmers' incomes. This paper further found that the critical driving forces of cropland circulation can be summarized as follows: transformation of rural labor to non-farming occupations, improvement of rural income, and legalization of land circulation markets. It should be noted that many off-farm workers have not given up their management rights for cropland, which is due to the following reasons: unstable job opportunities and insufficient social benefits of off-farm workers, low income from land rent and agricultural production, and lack of legal framework for land circulation. Therefore, urban-rural binary household registration (hukou) and migrant worker employment systems in China should be gradually reformed to accelerate the non-farming transformation of rural labor. Preferential policies for industrial investment can be made to attract more factories to operate in rural areas, which will bring more non-farming jobs to local famers and directly increase their incomes. Moreover, financial subsidy policies, land tenure system reform, and farmland consolidation strategies should also be launched to make land circulation more profitable for both land-givers and land-receivers. Finally, laws and regulations could be perfected and enforced to improve the legalization level of the land circulation market.

TI  - Effects of village savings and loan association on agricultural value productivity in Northern Region of Ghana
T2  - AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW
AB  - Purpose Agriculture in Ghana is dominated by smallholder farmers in rural areas. Majority of these farmers are resource-poor and faced with serious challenges in accessing formal financial services towards farming needs attributed to the stringent requirements. To bridge this gap, village savings and loan associations (VSLA) have been promoted in rural areas as an alternative to meeting the credit needs of smallholder farmers. Credit plays a vital role in input acquisition among farmers for improved agricultural value productivity. This study assesses the contribution of VSLA to agricultural value productivity in the Northern Region of Ghana. Design/methodology/approach The methodology is a primary cross-sectional data collected with the help of a semi-structured questionnaire. This study, therefore, applied a propensity score matching (PSM) to assess the effects of VSLA on agricultural value productivity. Findings Results from the PSM revealed that extension contact, contract farming, television set ownership, participating in "Planting for Food and Jobs" and nature of roads, including receiving VSLA information from members' increases participation decision of farmers in VSLA. Conversely, age of a farmer, household size, distance to output market and farmers in the Sagnarigu Municipality have negatively influenced VSLA participation. The propensity score matching estimates showed that members of VSLA obtained 38.2% higher agricultural value productivity than non-members. Originality/value Village savings and loans associations can be promoted among smallholder farmers as an effective alternative to formal financial service for inclusive development.

TI  - HOW SHOULD RURAL FINANCIAL COOPERATIVES BE BEST ORGANIZED? EVIDENCE FROM ETHIOPIA
T2  - ANNALS OF PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - What is the optimal size and composition of Rural Financial Cooperatives (RFCs)? With this broad question in mind, we characterize alternative formation of RFCs and their implications in improving rural households' access to financial services, including savings, credit and insurance services. We find that some features of RFCs have varying implications for delivering various financial services (savings, credit and insurance). We find that the size of RFCs exhibits nonlinear relationship with the various financial services RFCs provide. We also show that compositional heterogeneity among members (including diversity in wealth) is associated with higher access to credit services, while this has little implication on households' savings behavior. Similarly, social cohesion among members is strongly associated with higher access to financial services. These empirical descriptions suggest that the optimal size and composition of RFCs may vary across the domains of financial services they are designed to facilitate. These pieces of evidence provide some suggestive insights on how to ensure financial inclusion among smallholders, a pressing agenda and priority of policy makers in developing countries, including Ethiopia. The results also provide some insights into rural microfinance operations which are striving to satisfy members' demand for financial services.

TI  - Social dimensions of procurement auctions for environmental service contracts: Evaluating tradeoffs between cost-effectiveness and participation by the poor in rural Tanzania
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Determining the level of payment and selecting participants are important but frequently neglected issues that affect social, economic and environmental performance of payment for environmental services (PES) programs. We use a pilot auction to address these issues in the context of a PES program in Tanzania's Uluguru Mountains. Two-hundred fifty-one local farmers submitted sealed bids in the auction. The results reveal the supply of PES contracts at different prices. Simulations using the auction results and household data show large tradeoffs between achieving cost effectiveness and maximizing participation by poor households. A monitoring survey 21 months after the auction found that most auction winners' trees had survived, with performance uncorrelated to the farmer's poverty status or bid level. Although aspects of our auction design limit the strength of some of the conclusions we draw from the data, our study shows how pilot auctions can assist decision makers in estimating payment levels for PES contracts. Auction participants stated that the auction provided transparency in contract allocation and that winners felt peer pressure to comply with contracts, which suggest areas for future research regarding the potential advantages of using auctions to allocate PES contracts in developing countries.

TI  - What Do We Mean by "Women's Crops'? Commercialisation, Gender and the Power to Name
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We explore the relationship between commercialisation and gender for groundnuts in Eastern Province, Zambia, using a mixed methods approach. Women saw themselves as having greater control over groundnuts than other crops, and both sexes saw groundnuts as controlled by women. Propensity Score Matching showed that machine shelling and higher sales did not reduce women's perceived level of control over groundnuts. On the other hand, women welcomed greater male participation in machine shelling because it reduced the drudgery of shelling by hand, and were willing to trade some control in exchange for the male labour required to capture the full benefits from commercialisation. This suggests the need to re-think the narrative of commercalisation and gender as a zero sum game in favour of a cooperative-conflict model where bargaining between women and men can result in higher incomes for them both.

TI  - The nature of fair trade exchanges and their outcomes: Producer voices in Vietnam and India
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This paper brings insights to Fair Trade exchanges by casting commodities beyond material and pecuniary gains to include interpersonal relations. Although numerous studies have highlighted that Fair Trade brings benefits beyond the economic, the process through which 'material things' may become imbued with non-pecuniary value remains under-explored. Our analysis of interviews with Fairtrade certified smallholder farmers in Vietnam and in India provides insight into the discursive constructs of their participation in Fair Trade exchanges. Social exchange theory enables us to reconceptualise exchanges in the Fairtrade market to take into account interpersonal processes and long-term relations of exchange between actors. We find that Fair Trade is associated with benefits to both community and individuals and that these are intertwined and linked to participation in a democratic process in the cooperative. The pecuniary and non-pecuniary value generated and sustained by farmer democratic organizations needs to be recognised by Fairtrade importing businesses.

TI  - Heterogeneity of the Effects of Health Insurance on Household Savings: Evidence from Rural China
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We estimate the impact of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) on household savings by income quartiles in rural China. We control for endogenous NCMS participation with an instrumental variable strategy using the China Health and Nutrition survey. We find that NCMS has a negative impact on middle-income savings but does not affect the poorest participants. NCMS also decreases richest participants' savings, when they do not benefit from other health programs. Thus, the implementation of a health care scheme appears to be an appropriate tool to lower savings and boost consumption and so sustain economic growth. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The role of contract type in soil-improving investments: evidence from rice-planting large-scale production units in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - The emerging large-scale production units (LSPUs) have become increasingly important in Chinese agricultural production and rural transformation due to rapid industrialization and urbanization. Based on household and plot-level data from Jiangsu and Jiangxi Provinces in China, this study provides insights into the farming systems of these LSPUs and examines how contract type, as a proxy for land tenure security, impacts on the production unit's soil-improving investments. Results from the two-stage control function approach show that the written nature of contracts positively affects the application of organic fertilizer and green manure on rented-in plots. Descriptive analysis also confirms the collateralization effect of contract type by showing that plots that are used as collateral for credit are characterized by written contracts. Policies facilitating LSPUs' access to farmland with more formal contracts may therefore play an important role in improving soil quality and land productivity.

TI  - The macroeconomic and welfare implications of rural health insurance and pension reforms in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMICS OF AGEING
AB  - We assess the potential impact of rural health insurance and pension reforms on macroeconomic outcomes and social welfare in a dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated to the Chinese economy. We analyze transition paths as well as steady state responses to the new policies. The current reforms in China provide modest rural pensions and reimbursement of a portion of healthcare costs, but at rates that are substantially lower than are already in place in the urban sector. We investigate the potential effect of raising the rural benefit rates to those enjoyed in the urban sector. While both reforms reduce income per capita, we show that the health insurance reforms are potentially welfare improving if they are implemented in a way that leads to reduced out-of-pocket health spending. The welfare gains are driven by rural health insurance providing relief from the risk of catastrophic medical expenditures that can wipe out household savings and force long working hours. A pay-as-you-go rural pension results in a welfare gain in the short-run but welfare loss in the long-run due to the distorting effects of taxes. Despite an increase in required financing due to an aging population, the welfare impact of rural health insurance remains positive when incorporating the projected old-age dependency ratio for the year 2050. However, a pay-as-you-go rural pension creates large income and welfare losses with 2050 demographics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Panarchy of an indigenous agroecosystem in the globalized market: The quinoa production in the Bolivian Altiplano
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Agricultural globalization is blamed for destructive impacts on small farms in developing countries. Yet, many local societies are proactive in the face of these changes and show high adaptive capacity. Investigating their transformations with an integrative perspective and enough hindsight may reveal some of the bases of their resilience and adaptive capacity. Using field data and the panarchy concept of resilience theory, we analyzed the territorial and social dynamics of quinoa growers' communities in southern Bolivia over the last four decades, a case study of regime shift in a poverty-stricken rural society which deliberately entered the global food market. Linking the dynamics of the household economy to the territorial and social subsystems over several decades, we gained insights into the interactions that shaped the rise of quinoa production in the region. We found that a vivid tradition of mobility allowing for pluriactivity on- and off-farm, combined with community self-governance, explains how local populations succeeded in articulating individual agency with collective control over their commons of land, seed resources, and social rules. Our vulnerability analysis points to landscape homogenization, social inequity, and increased dependence on external factors as potential sources of unsustainability. We conclude that, to cope with the changes of unprecedented magnitude they are facing, local producers should retain social cohesion and autonomous governance, without giving up on their heritage of mobility and economic redundancy. As regards theory, we identified cross-scale subsystem configurations critical for regime shifts, and confirm the value of panarchy in capturing complex socioecological dynamics.

TI  - Financial repression in China's agricultural economy
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine whether or not financial repression exists in the saving and investment activities of farm households in rural areas of China.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper empirically investigates repression in rural China using the McKinnon-Shaw model and microeconomic data combined with lending and savings rates and ceilings by rural credit cooperatives.
   Findings - The paper finds only limited evidence of a repression dominated by savings, while investment response appears to be, at least on average, normal or unrepressed. More specifically, the paper finds that the relationship between growth and investment is consistent with an unrepressed economy but savings do show evidence of repression.
   Originality/value - The political focus of economic reformation in China has been one of rapid economic growth in urban areas and a neglect of the agriculture sector. This focus on urban growth has led some Chinese scholars to speculate that the residual impact is a repressed agricultural and rural economy, at least in the context of McKinnon and Shaw framework. However, such speculations have not previously been verified. This paper presents the first attempt to determine the relationships exclusively in the context of the agricultural economy.

TI  - A Spot of Coffee in Crisis Nicaraguan Smallholder Cooperatives, Fair Trade Networks, and Gendered Empowerment
T2  - LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Comparison of responses to the post-1999 coffee crisis of three smallholder cooperatives participating in Fair Trade and conventional commodity networks suggests that agrarian-reform histories, gender relations, and bottom-up organizing practices influenced members' sense of empowerment. Although most small-scale farmers suffered a decline in their sense of empowerment, the Fair Trade cooperatives found opportunity in the midst of the crisis. In addition to documenting North-South inequalities, this research reveals the uneven gender relationships within producer cooperatives, finds the lowest empowerment levels in a cooperative connected only with conventional coffee trade networks, and chronicles the achievements of a women's Fair Trade cooperative.

TI  - Assessing the potential for niche market development to contribute to farmers' livelihoods and agrobiodiversity conservation: Insights from the finger millet case study in Nepal
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper explores the potential for niche market development of neglected and underutilized species as an intervention for improving both smallholder livelihoods and the agrobiodiversity conservation. We consider the case of finger millet, which plays an important role in the food security of Nepalese poor and marginalized farmers. Despite such importance, production and consumption are decreasing as a result of, inter alia, the expanding availability of more profitable crops, a lack of awareness regarding its nutritional qualities by urban consumers and limited R&D dedicated to this crop. Nevertheless, the potential to improve the ability of farmers to capture the values related to the positive environmental and nutritional externalities associated with the production and consumption of local landraces, suggests that the conservation through use of such genetic resources can support the achievement of development goals. We analyse both the demand and supply side of a potential niche market for local finger millets. Using a choice experiment we find that urban consumers have a willingness to pay a premium price sufficient to compensate producers' conservation opportunity costs. We also identify a range of challenges for such an intervention to be considered effective from both an economic and ecological perspective. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - How did land titling affect China's rural land rental market? Size, composition and efficiency
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Based on 2010-2015 official surveys conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture, we apply the difference-indifferences method to study how the latest land titling reform in China affected the land rental market. While we cannot attribute the rapid growth of the land rental market during this period to the land titling reform, the reform did have a significant impact on the composition of renters and certain features of the rental transaction. Specifically, we show that the land titling reform led to an increase in land transferred to agricultural enterprises and cooperatives, and a decrease in the probability of households renting land out to other households (which were likely to be relatives and friends). The land titling reform also encouraged households to use written contracts and to charge pecuniary rents, although it did not affect the duration of the contract. Our results suggest that the land titling reform improved the efficiency of the land rental market by promoting the formalisation of rental contracts and by facilitating the allocation of land to more productive users.

TI  - Relative deprivation and health revisited: New evidence from middle-aged and older adults in rural China
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - The critical role of income in individual health is not only reflected in the direct effect of income but also derived from the relative income levels within cohorts. This study first constructs relative deprivation indicators to measure the relative income levels of rural households by taking village -level households as the reference group. Using the data from the four waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (2011-2018), we apply a panel event study approach to detect the impact of relative deprivation on the health status of rural middle-aged and older adults. The estimation results show the significantly negative and persistent effects of deterio-ration in relative deprivation on the physical and mental health outcomes of these adults. In rural China, the impact of relative deprivation on individual health shows significant age and wealth differences, but no significant gender differences are observed. Meanwhile, local collective cul-ture plays important roles. The findings have important implications for the government to improve public health policies and promote healthy aging.

TI  - Livelihood options of landless households and land contracts in north-west Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Agricultural land scarcity and increasing landlessness are becoming serious livelihood challenges in rural areas of highland Ethiopia. Land contracts give access to land for landless households through sharecropping and rent. The paper examines the demand for land, livelihood options of landless households, and the role of land contracts in mitigating land shortages among the rural communities. Its specific objectives are intended to examine the: (1) land demand and livelihood options of landless households and (2) role of land contracts in mitigation of land shortages and the implication of this on sustainable management of land resources. The study was conducted in Dangila district in the north-western highlands of Ethiopia. Data were gathered from a survey of 201 rural households from April 2011 to October 2012. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, and independent samples t test were used to analyse the data. Results indicate that over 14 % of the studied households were landless and demanding farmlands. Sharecropping, daily labour, selling wood and charcoal, and rearing livestock were major livelihood options and strategies practiced by landless households next to crop farming. Sharecropping contracts were found to minimize the land demand of over 95 % of the landless households. However, most of the sharecropping contracts (58 %) were managed through informal customary practices. Old age, having many dependent family members, and owning large farm plots were found to encourage the practice of the sharing-out of land. Conversely, youth, higher education level, and ownership of many livestock initiated the sharing-in of land. Shared and contracted plots were, however, observed not to have been treated with proper sustainable soil and water conservation technologies. Allocating grazing lands and accessing credit facilities were actions taken by local governments to stabilize land shortages. It is concluded that making credit accessible to landless households and promoting the development of small-scale enterprises in rural areas can help to engage the idle agricultural labour and ease the pressure on land resources. Preconditions should be set to sustainably use and manage contracted lands and shared plots and to avoid the wasteful use of agricultural lands. There should be a focus on promoting small-scale enterprises (i.e. expanding the non-farming sector) in rural areas and minimizing informal land contracts. Liberalizing the land market by lifting the land contract restrictions can enhance the exchange of land among the rural households.

TI  - Effect of Land Property Rights on Forest Resources in Southern China
T2  - LAND
AB  - The land tenure reform is important for forest resource management worldwide. Since China initiated a new round of collective forestland tenure reform (CFTR) in 2003, improving forest output by clarifying property rights plays a crucial role in realizing sustainable forest resource management. Using survey data of 312 bamboo plantation households from Southern China, this paper empirically examines the impact path of land property rights on forest resources. The estimation results show that both the forestland use right and disposal right are able to significantly improve the forest output by encouraging households to invest and optimizing the allocation of forestry labor. Particularly, the results reveal that the use right has a positive impact on forest output through forestland investment. With regard to the disposal right, we find that it has a positive effect on forest output through forestland investment, but it has a negative impact on forest output through the forestry labor allocation. The findings of this study suggest that to promote the growth of forest resources, the government should endow households with a more complete set of rights, and further strengthen their understanding of property rights. In addition, our findings enhance the understanding of the collective forestland tenure reform in China; they also have implications for the decentralized management of forestry elsewhere in the world.

TI  - Can PES and REDD plus match Willingness To Accept payments in contracts for reforestation and avoided forest degradation? The case of farmers in upland Bac Kan, Vietnam
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - REDD + (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) social safeguards promote improvement of local communities' livelihoods. However, discussion on benefit sharing in REDD + has largely focused on coefficients for differentiated distribution of available funds. The question of economic incentives required to voluntarily establish and maintain tree cover has received limited attention. Using contingent evaluation, we elicited Willingness-To-Accept compensation for entering into contracts requiring farmers to 1) establish plantations, 2) abstain from logging mature plantations and 3) refrain from cutting indigenous hardwood trees in Ba Be and Na Ri districts in Bac Kan province, Vietnam. We found average WTA payments in the range of 231-402 USD ha(-1),256-414 USD ha(-1) year(-1) and 387-594 USD ha(-1) year(-1) in these three scenarios, with WTA payments significantly higher in Ba Be district, characterised as poorer than Na Ri. Published estimates suggest payments of 38-43 USD ha(-1) year(-1) from PFES (Paymnent for Forest Ecosystem Services), REDD + and government support combined and a one-off payment of 300 USD ha(-1) from government reforestation schemes. Hence, the inability to match WTA levels suggests a bleak outlook for PFES or REDD + projects aiming to comply with social safeguard measures to protect rural household welfare. However, we note that everyone in the sample was willing to engage in these contracts given compensation.

TI  - Farmers' perceptions of navy bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) production constraints, preferred traits and farming systems and their implications on bean breeding: a case study from South East Lowveld region of Zimbabwe
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
AB  - Background Navy bean is an important legume crop in Zimbabwe. Although its production in Zimbabwe is limited by multiple constraints including biotic, abiotic and socio-economic, there is no documented evidence. Thus, this study aimed at identifying farmers' production constraints, preferred traits and cultivars of navy bean, and strategies used to mitigate some of these constraints. Methods A Participatory Rural Appraisal approach involving transect walks, focus group discussions (FGDs), and formal surveys with semi-structured questionnaires was conducted in four villages of the Lowveld region of Zimbabwe. In each of the four villages, two FGDs (one for men and one for women) were conducted. A total of 176 (75 males and 101 females) navy bean-growing households were interviewed. Data from household interviews and FGDs was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Scientists computer package. Results The most important constraints to navy bean production were drought stress (Females-86%, Males-73%), heat stress (Females-58%, Males-55%), power outages (Females-46%, Males-54%), poor soil fertility (Females-32%; Males-33%) and susceptibility to pod shattering (Females-32%, Males-43%). Mitigation strategies included mulching (18%), ridges (12%), reduced acreage (11%), and cultivating to retain more soil moisture (11%) for drought stress, while irrigating at night (32%), and adjusting planting dates (29%) were used to manage heat stress. Farmer-preferred traits included tolerance to drought and heat, early maturing varieties and disease resistance. Marketing constraints included non-payment for produce in hard currency, lack of diversity in terms of off-takers, high inflation, low grain producer price, delayed payment and breach of contract by contractors. Conclusion There will be increased adoption of improved navy bean cultivars if breeding programs address the aforementioned constraints and consider farmer-preferred traits when developing new cultivars. Breeders should work closely with extension officers to ensure that cultivars released are cultivated with appropriate agronomic packages for increased productivity and high adoption.

TI  - Seroprevalence of human brucellosis among the tribal and non-tribal population residing in an eastern state of India: Findings from the state-wide serosurvey
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundBrucellosis is a neglected zoonotic disease found predominantly in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs), causing significant public health concern in India. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of human brucellosis in Odisha, India among community members involved in animal husbandry as a common practice. MethodThis cross-sectional study included 817 adult participants from 11 districts in Odisha. Four districts from the Northern division, four districts from the Central division, and three districts from the Southern division were selected for the study. Blood samples were collected during a COVID-19 serosurvey in Odisha conducted from 1st to 17th September 2021. Immunoglobulin-G (IgG) antibodies were measured against Brucella using a commercial ELISA kit. Point estimates at 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and adjusted odds ratio were calculated. ResultsThe overall prevalence of anti-Brucella IgG antibodies was calculated at 16.65% (95% CI: 14.19-19.42). The highest seropositivity was found in Sambalpur district (29.73%; 95% CI: 16.43-47.16) and the lowest was determined in Mayurbhanj district (4.44%; 95% CI: 0.99-15.60). Compared to males, females were more prone to contracting the disease (AOR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.05-1.67). Participants from rural settings had higher prevalence of anti-Brucella IgG antibodies than urban dwellers (AOR: 4.53; 95% CI: 1.73-11.86). ConclusionThis study revealed that human brucellosis was associated with sociodemographic factors like gender, living settings, and household numbers. To prevent brucellosis, screening should be initiated, infected humans should be treated early, and the public should be educated about risk factors and preventive measures.

TI  - Growing and Learning Together in Fostering Multisectoral Participation for Sustaining Interventions: Lessons from 3 Successive Integrated Multidisciplinary Interventions in Rural Ghana
T2  - CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN NUTRITION
AB  - Despite the recognition of nutrition as a multisectoral development issue, institutional silos persist as barriers to addressing community nutrition challenges effectively and sustainably. Over the past 2 decades, 3 integrated agriculture, livelihood, nutrition, and health interventions have been implemented in rural communities across Ghana, aimed at nurturing multisectoral collaborations to enhance institutional capacity, women's empowerment, children's diets and nutritional status, and general household well-being. Using information from published articles on the interventions, workshop reports, informal institutional engagements, and field notes, insights are presented on the efforts to garner multisectoral participation to sustain these interventions. Challenges and opportunities encountered in the process of growing and learning together relative to overcoming institutional cultures, building trust, empathizing with partners' institutional challenges, making collective decisions, and building common ownership and accountability are explored. Fostering effective multisectoral participation is a dynamic process of continuous learning.

TI  - Influence of labor transfer on farmland sustainable development: a regional comparison of plain and hilly areas
T2  - QUALITY & QUANTITY
AB  - Based on the survey data on famers in plain and hilly areas, this paper applies the descriptive statistics and logistic regression model to conduct a comparative study on the difference between both regions in terms of the influence of labor transfer on the sustainable development of farmland use. The study shows that the surplus agricultural labor force in plain and hilly areas is different from the perspective of regional supply and demand, with the convergent ratio of rural labor transfer and the ratio of land abandonment. The influences of labor force type, age, gender and number on the farmland sustainable development of hilly areas are at the confidence levels of 1, 1, 5 and 10% with negative significance; and the influence of labor force culture on the farmland sustainable development of plain is at the confidence level of 5% with positive significance. Consequently, the labor force transfer accelerate the farmland transfer in plain, increase the area of contracted-farmland by families and upgrade the production efficiency of farmland; besides, the reduction of labor force number and quality in the hilly areas lead to the severe phenomenon of land abandonment, decreased farmland use in large scale and the apparent trend of transforming the rice from two harvests to one harvest a year. Therefore, the ecological environmental renovation of farmland shall be speeded up to embark on the road of eco-agriculture and featured agriculture.

TI  - Access to Microloans for Households with Forest Property Collateral in China
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - About 100 million rural households in China have obtained forest property certification, which could serve as collateral to help households obtain microloans intended for forest management and investment. However, it is still difficult for households to receive these loans using forests as collateral. The strong demand for loans from the Rural Credit Cooperative cannot be met. This paper attempts to understand microloan access behavior using 241 respondents in three typical Chinese counties. It argues that the loan is determined by both the demand from the household as well as the supply from banks. Logistic regression models are used to investigate what might affect accessibility to households' microloans. Household characteristics like age, education, income, forest characteristics as well as the regional variation of loans are used as explanatory variables. Age, education and income as well as the perception of the bank services are found statistically significant. Other findings include that only half of the respondents who received loans supposed for forest management but use for other purposes. Most importantly, it is found that joint-loan arrangement is more suitable for small-scale households and direct-loan and guaranteed-loans are better match larger property size. A simplified loan-process and discount points would lower transaction costs and improve rural households' accessibility to microloan using of forest property collateral.

TI  - Vulnerability of the Tibetan Pastoral Systems to Climate and Global Change
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - The impacts of climate and global change on Tibetan pastoral systems have become increasingly evident. Thus, a significant research endeavor is to explore the combined effects of these changes on the livelihoods of herder households and communities, on the adaptation strategies they adopted to respond to the current and expected risks associated with these changes, and on the emerging opportunities that can strengthen their resilience and adaptive capacity. We performed an integrated analysis of the dynamics of Tibetan pastoral systems influenced by climate and global changes by using the analytical framework developed by Ostrom. Climate and global changes have significantly altered the attributes of and the interactions within Tibetan pastoral systems, thus posing great challenges to their sustainable development. We used Nagqu County, a remote area of the northern Tibetan Plateau of China, as a case study to analyze the adaptation strategies adopted by local herders to respond to multiple stressors, as well as the emerging opportunities that they can take advantage of to increase their adaptive capacity. Findings show that although local herders have developed various adaptation strategies, such as planting forage grass, buying fodder from the market, renting pastures, joining formal or informal cooperatives, and diversifying livelihoods, social, cultural, and institutional challenges still exist. To enhance the adaptive capacity of herders and to reduce their vulnerability, we recommend that future rangeland policies and programs promote: (1) comprehensive support for formal or informal pastoral cooperatives, (2) development of the rangeland economy to take advantage of the multifunctionalities of rangeland ecosystems, and (3) revitalization of the mobility paradigm to allow the flexible use of rangelands.

TI  - The implications of ignoring smallholder agriculture in climate-financed forestry projects: empirical evidence from two REDD plus pilot projects
T2  - CLIMATE POLICY
AB  - Changes in agricultural practices can play a pivotal role in climate change mitigation by reducing the need for land use change as one of the biggest sources of GHG emissions, and by enabling carbon sequestration in farmers' fields. Expansion of smallholder and commercial agriculture is often one of the main driving forces behind deforestation and forest degradation. However, mitigation programmes such as REDD+ are geared towards conservation efforts in the forestry sector without prominently taking into account smallholder agricultural interests in project design and implementation. REDD+ projects often build on existing re- and afforestation projects without major changes in their principles, interests and assumptions. Informed by case study research and interviews with national and international experts, we illustrate with examples from Ethiopia and Indonesia how REDD+ projects are implemented, how they fail to adequately incorporate the demands of smallholder farmers and how this leads to a loss of livelihoods and diminishing interest in participating in REDD+ by local farming communities. The study shows how the conservation-based benefits and insecure funding base in REDD+ projects do not compensate for the contraction in livelihoods from agriculture. Combined with exclusive benefit-sharing mechanisms, this results in an increased pressure on forest resources, diverging from the principal objective of REDD+. We note a gap between the REDD+ narratives at international level (i.e. coupling development with a climate agenda) and the livelihood interests of farming communities on the ground. We argue that without incorporating agricultural interests and a review of financial incentives in the design of future climate finance mechanisms, objectives of both livelihood improvements and GHG emission reductions will be missed.Key policy insights REDD+ is positioned as a promising tool to meet climate, conservation and development targets. However, these expectations are not being met in practice as the interests of smallholder farmers are poorly addressed.REDD+ policy developers and implementers need more focus on understanding the interests and dynamics of smallholder agriculturalists to enable inclusive, realistic and long-lasting projects.For REDD+ to succeed, funders need to consider how to better ensure long-term livelihood security for farming communities.

TI  - The causal effect of childhood measles vaccination on educational attainment: A mother fixed-effects study in rural South Africa
T2  - VACCINE
AB  - Background: Because measles vaccination prevents acute measles disease and morbidities secondary to measles, such as undernutrition, blindness, and brain damage, the vaccination may also lead to higher educational attainment. However, there has been little evidence to support this hypothesis at the population level. In this study, we estimate the causal effect of childhood measles vaccination on educational attainment among children born between 1995 and 2000 in South Africa.
   Methods and findings: We use longitudinal data on measles vaccination status and school grade attainment among 4783 children. The data were collected by the Wellcome Trust Africa Centre Demographic Information System (ACDIS), which is one of Africa's largest health and demographic surveillance systems. ACDIS is located in a poor, predominantly rural, Zulu-speaking community in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Using mother fixed-effects regression, we compare the school grade attainment of siblings who are discordant in their measles vaccination status but share the same mother and household. This fixed-effects approach controls for confounding due to both observed and unobserved factors that do not vary between siblings, including sibling-invariant mother and household characteristics such as attitudes toward risk, conscientiousness, and aspirations for children. We further control for a range of potential confounders that vary between siblings, such as sex of the child, year of birth, mother's age at child's birth, and birth order. We find that measles vaccination on average increases school grade attainment by 0.188 grades (95% confidence interval, 0.0424-0.334; p = 0.011).
   Conclusions: Measles vaccination increased educational attainment in this poor, largely rural community in South Africa. For every five to seven children vaccinated against measles, one additional school grade was gained. The presence of a measles vaccination effect in this community is plausible because (i) measles vaccination prevents measles complications including blindness, brain damage, and undernutrition; (ii) a large number of number of children were at risk of contracting measles because of the comparatively low measles vaccination coverage; and (iii) significant measles transmission occurred in the community where this study took place during the study observation period. Our results demonstrate for the first time that measles vaccination affects human development not only through its health effects but also through its effects on education. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Using Data on Social Influence and Collective Action for Parameterizing a Geographically-Explicit Agent-Based Model for the Diffusion of Soil Conservation Efforts
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT
AB  - Social influence affects individual decision-making on soil conservation. Understanding the emergent diffusion of collective conservation effort is relevant to natural resource management at the river basin level. This study focuses on the effect of subjective norms and collective action on the diffusion of Soil Conservation Effort (SCE) in the Lake Naivasha basin (Kenya) for the period 1965-2010. A geographically-explicit Agent-Based Model (ABM) version of the CONSUMAT model was developed: the CONSERVAT model. In our model, we have represented heterogeneity in the physical environment and in the social network using empirical data. To parameterize the model, physical data, and social data from a household survey (n=307) were used. Model simulation results show that it is possible to reproduce empirical spatiotemporal diffusion patterns of SCE levels which are quite sensitive to the way in which social survey data are used to initialize the model. Overall, this study demonstrates (i) that social survey data can effectively be used for parameterization of a geographically-explicit ABM, and (ii) that empirical knowledge on natural environment characteristics and social phenomena can be used to build an agent-based model at the river basin level. This study is an important first step towards including subjective norms for evaluating the effectiveness of alternative policy strategies for natural resource management.

TI  - Land rental market legal restrictions in Northern Ethiopia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - This study assesses the de jure and de facto land market legal restrictions in the Tigray region in Ethiopia and the extent of implementation of the new land rental restrictions that were introduced in 2006 that state that not more than 50% of a farm can be rented out. The knowledge, perceptions and attitudes regarding the law among local Land Administration Committee (LAC) members, local conflict mediators and a sample of rural households are investigated. We find that the rented area restriction is commonly violated and not enforced. The law is circumvented by framing sharecropping as something other than land rental, although sharecropping is the dominant land rental contract in the region. When it is made clear that the law may hurt weak and vulnerable (often female-headed) households that are unable to farm their land themselves and therefore rent it out, the large majority of LAC members, conflict mediators and rural households are against the law.

TI  - The determinants and economic impacts of membership in coffee farmer cooperatives: recent evidence from rural Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Smallholder farmers in developing countries are often encouraged to get organized into cooperatives mainly to overcome production and marketing constraints that usually hinder the improvement of their livelihoods. However, impact evaluations regarding the contribution of cooperatives are limited; evaluation results are mixed and are not conclusive. The current study contributes to the literature by examining the determinants and economic impacts of cooperative membership using household survey data gathered from coffee farmers in the Jimma Zone of Oromia, Ethiopia. A propensity score matching (PSM) and endogenous switching regression (ESR) models are used to estimate treatment effects by controlling for selection biases. The results are augmented with qualitative data collected through group discussions made with randomly selected farmers in the study area. Findings indicate that the probability of farmers' membership decision increases with age, education level, family size, social networks, land property and accessibility to cooperatives. Both PSM and ESR models show that membership is positively associated with household income and assets. The ESR estimation results further confirm that members economically perform significantly better than if they had not been members and nonmembers would have even performed better than members if they had joined cooperatives. The results of group discussions also verify overall direct and spill-over effects, though cooperative services to members and non-members are undifferentiated. The results indicate a need for a mechanism to enhance the participation of poorer farm households, and to further improve member benefits as potential areas in making cooperatives more meaningful, attractive and sustainable.

TI  - Provisioning ecosystem services-sharing as a coping and adaptation strategy among rural communities in Ghana's semi-arid ecosystem
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB  - As complex challenges linked to changing socio-economic, environmental, political, and cultural conditions continually hamper the delivery of ecosystem services to natural resource dependent communities, local level adaptation needs attention. This paper presents the findings of an empirical survey in rural semi-arid Ghana investigating how households are employing communal sharing as a strategy to enhance access and management of nine provisioning ecosystem services (provisioning ES) namely crops and vegetables, livestock and poultry, bushmeat, freshwater, wildplants, fodder and forage, traditional medicine, fuelwood, and building materials. The results indicate that the variations in the sharing patterns of the nine provisioning ES can be linked to a mix of closely-linked socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental factors. Traditional medicine is the most commonly shared, whilst building materials are the least commonly shared. Sharing intensifies during the long dry season for majority of the provisioning ES. Logistic regression modeling indicates annual household income to be the most significant socio-demographic variable influencing participation in sharing. A greater proportion of interviewed household heads (64%) perceive sharing to be on the decline. These findings provide important baseline data for further quantitative and qualitative research exploring sharing's potential contribution to rural households' livelihoods sustenance and ecosystem sustainability under changing conditions.

TI  - If It Pays, It Stays: Can Agribusiness Internalize the Benefits of Malaria Control?
T2  - WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Might a malaria control intervention entail agricultural effects that allow a commercial agribusiness to offset its costs? The randomized allocation of 39,936 insecticide-treated mosquito nets among 81,597 smallholder cotton farming households in 1,507 clusters helps evaluate this in the context of Zambia's cotton outgrowing industry. But despite large health impacts on treated households, no impact on cotton deliveries to the agribusiness is detected. With some caveats, the results tend to strike a discord with recent evidence on the agricultural productivity effects of malaria control.

TI  - Economic impression of on-farm research for sustainable crop production, milk yield, and livelihood options in semi-arid regions of central India
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
AB  - Farming system research (FSR) is on-farm research that brings cutting-edge agricultural technologies to growers to enhance farm production, family income, and livelihood status. In 2007, an on-farm study was started on FSR in central India, and the effect was assessed after 5 yr (2012-2013) of implementation by comparing adopters and nonadopters of FSR-based promoted technologies. Further, in 2018-2019, the status of adoption of introduced technologies was also assessed. The study revealed that improved practices such as pre-sowing irrigation, high-yielding varieties, and crop protection measures collectively improved the system productivity of the adopters by 28%; the improved productivity was mainly due to increased yield of blackgram (Vigna mungo L., 157%), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L., 34%), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 12%). Adoption of ration balancing and healthcare practices promoted under the FSR project accentuated the milk yield of farm animals (200 L yr(-1) cattle(-1)) of adopters. The farm diversification and sustainable production practices under the FSR-based interventions increased family income of adopters by 35% (US$1,517.7 yr(-1)) and employment by 42%. Adopter households averaged a 33.76% higher return per unit of investment than nonadopters. The estimated change is primarily due to the non-neutral technological change. The findings of the study offer important lessons for the promotion of FSR-based interventions for improving the livelihood of resource-poor farmers in arid and the semi-arid regions across the world.

TI  - Contract farming and technical efficiency: Evidence from low-value and high-value crops in Nepal
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - Contract farming (CF), an institutional innovation, can reduce transaction costs and solve market imperfections in many developing countries. This study compares productivity and technical efficiency (TE) of contract and independent producers of high yielding variety (HYV) paddy seed (a low-value crop) and ginger (a high-value crop) producers in a sample of smallholders in Nepal. We address the self-selection into CF by using propensity score matching and translog stochastic frontier function to estimate our empirical model. Using farm-level data from Nepal, our findings show that CF increased the average TE levels of HYV paddy seed producers from 87% to 94% and the average TE levels of ginger producers from 89% to 97%. Finally, we find that human capital and distance to the market increases the technical inefficiency of low-value crop smallholders in Nepal.

TI  - Barriers and bridges on water management in rural Mexico: from water-quality monitoring to water management at the community level
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - Access to sufficient water of suitable quality represents a challenge for achieving several dimensions of sustainable development. Currently, water access is restricted to three of 10 persons globally. In rural areas of Mexico and other low-income countries, coverage could be even less due to the absence of formal supply; thus, rural communities usually perform water management. Surrounding community-based water management, various socio-ecological interactions emerge that determine access to water. Access to water will depend on the obstacles or capacities that arise within the socio-ecological system in which the community is immersed. This work identifies barriers and bridges to water access in a rural environment through mixed methods. The article draws on three case studies in southeastern Mexico by analyzing 90 questionnaires conducted at the household level and three focus groups in parallel with water quality analysis and its relationship with management practices. The barriers and bridges were classified into six water access challenges: (i) access to water in a sufficient quantity, (ii) access to water of adequate quality, (iii) access to water for household crop irrigation, (iv) hygiene and sanitation facilities, (v) collective organization, and (vi) climate variability. The main findings indicate that households' water quantity and quality show deficiencies due to the lack of formal infrastructure and represent a health risk. Water fetching has the highest impact on women and children in poor rural areas, and it is a significant barrier to sustainable development. In contrast, the collective organization proved to be an essential bridge for water access in these communities.

TI  - China's new cooperative medical scheme and equity in access to health care: evidence from a longitudinal household survey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB  - Introduction: China's New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) was brought to life in 2003 in response to the deterioration in access to health services in rural areas. Despite its fast expansion, the scheme's impacts on access to health care have raised growing concerns, in particular regarding whether and to what extent the scheme has reduced inequity in access to health care in rural China.
   Methods: This study examines income-related inequity in access to health care from 2004 (before the national rollout of NCMS) to 2009 (after the expansion of NCMS across the rural China) by estimating Concentration Indices over both formal health care (outpatient care, prevention care) and informal health care use (folk doctor care). Data were drawn from a longitudinal household survey dataset - China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS).
   Results: The study suggested that the level of inequity remained the same for outpatient care, and an increased favouring-poor gap in terms of folk doctor care was observed. In terms of preventive care, a favouring-rich inequity was observed both in 2004 and 2009, but the effects of inequity were narrowed. The NCMS had some effects in reducing income-related health inequity in folk doctor care and preventive care, but the contribution was rather small. The study also found that the rural better-off had started to seek for commercial insurance to cover possible financial risks from the burden of diseases.
   Conclusion: The study concludes that the impacts of the NCMS on improving access to formal care for the poor are limited. Without a more comprehensive insurance package that effectively targets the rural poor, the intended equity goals expected from the scheme will be difficult to realize.

TI  - Effects on poverty and equity of the decline in collective tank irrigation management in Tamil Nadu, India
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper investigates the factors influencing the decline in collective management of local commons and the impact of this decline on agricultural production and household consumption. The analysis is based on a village and household data set collected in 1999 in Tamil Nadu, India, where tank irrigation systems are managed collectively for rice cultivation by informal water users' organizations. Our statistical analyses find that one major reason for the decline in collective tank irrigation management is the dissemination of private well irrigation systems. Once the decline has occurred, our analyses predict that the gap in rice yields between farmers who have access to private wells and those who must rely solely on tanks will widen, with only the latter group suffering lower yields. Our analyses also find that the same pattern holds for levels of income and consumption because the affected farmers cannot sufficiently compensate for the loss of their rice income by diversifying their income sources to agricultural labor or nonagricultural work. In this way, the decline in collective management results in greater inequality and poverty.

TI  - FARM LEVEL IMPACTS OF CREDIT CONSTRAINTS ON AGRICULTURAL INVESTMENT AND INCOME
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB  - Pakistan is an agriculture based economy and the main economic activity in Sindh province is farming, which is a capital intensive business. For diversified and efficient agricultural production, agricultural investment is important. Despite the importance of the modern technological practices, most farmers are still practicing subsistence agriculture. The lack of capital is the one of the major constraints in increasing investment in farming. The main focus of this article is to examine rice farmer's investment and the income under credit constraints in rural Sindh, Pakistan. For this research an endogenous switching regression model was employed to conclude the problem of selection bias and endogeneity of credit constraints. In order to achieve the results from visible and invisible factors average treatment effect was utilized. The results revealed that more than half of farmers (65.0 percent) from the total sample are hampered by supply-side (34.0 percent) and demand-side (31.0 percent) credit constraints. Importantly, the results have significant implications that agricultural investment and income can be increased up to 7.3 and 5.1 percent, if there are no credit constraints. Therefore, it is suggested that investment in agriculture can be increased if there is no or minimized credit constraints, which can ultimately increase the farmers' income in the country.

TI  - Informal Institutions Moderate the Relationship Between Environmental Emotion and Grassland Governance Behavior
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Clarifying the behavior motivation of herders participating in grassland governance has important theoretical and practical significance for the construction of ecological civilization and economic development in pastoral areas. Based on the data from 425 households in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, this paper constructs a Double-Hurdle model to explore the impact of informal institutions and environmental emotion (individual emotion, collective emotion, and intergenerational dependence) on herders' grassland governance. The results show that informal institutions promote herders' willingness and payment for participating in grassland governance, and collective emotions hinder herders' participation, showing a "free-ride " mentality. Informal institutions moderate the relationship between collective emotions and grassland governance behavior. Informal institutions also help herders understand the collective sense of responsibility and morality behind grassland protection, thereby reducing the "free-ride " mentality. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain the informal institutions' role as a "glue " in the traditional culture of pastoral areas and to promote the realization of policy goals.

TI  - Paid Domestic Work: Gender and the Informal Economy in Mexico
T2  - LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES
AB  - A consideration of paid domestic work as an aspect of the informal economy in Mexico identifies some distinctive features: a paternalistic view rather than a labor relation based on a contract, a reluctance on the part of the state to regulate this employment area, and a devaluation of this work as something largely performed by women who are poor and of rural or indigenous origin. The lack of social security is almost universal among paid domestic workers, and coverage is one of the principal demands of organizations formed in defense of their rights.

TI  - Participation mode and production efficiency enhancement mechanism of Geographical Indication products in rural areas: A meta-frontier analysis
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
AB  - This paper explored how rural cooperatives influence technology efficiency of farmer in the context of Geographical Indication (GI) products industry and identify the main influence factors, to realize regional sustainable development. Based on a survey of rural households in Qingyuan County located in the northeast forest zone in China, where is famous for GI product - Chinese Gentian (a Chinese herbal medicine), the efficiency enhancement mechanism of two groups of farmers (cooperative participants and cooperative non-participants) is analyzed, a meta-frontier analysis (MFA) model is constructed to empirical analyze the impact of farmers' participation in cooperatives on the efficiency of Chinese herbal medicine cultivation, and the heterogeneity of farmers that influence technical inefficiency is identified. The conclusions include: Two different ways to participate in the cultivation of GI products are through cooperatives and self-participation which keep farmers at different frontiers of production; The difference in efficiency within the rural cooperative is small but the efficiency of self-participating farmers is relatively large; The efficiency is about 32% higher, which explains the main reason for increase the efficiency of farmers are unified management, skill training and knowledge information diffusion. Household head age, education, enthusiasm and agricultural skill are the main influencing factors of technology inefficiency. This paper enriches the understanding of how rural cooperatives promote technology efficiency of rural households, especially with the heterogeneity of farmers' endowment, and how this contribute to the adaptive management of local GI brand and targeted poverty alleviation to realize rural revitalization.

TI  - Are land rental markets responding to rising population pressures and land scarcity in sub-Saharan Africa?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Although still at incipient stages in most areas, agricultural land markets in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are growing rapidly. While the literature on the region's land markets is expanding, there has been little attention thus far paid to the drivers of land rental prices. We know quite little about whether and how land markets and land contracts respond to meso-scale factors such as spatial variations in land abundance, or to micro-level factors, such as household land endowments. In this paper, we study the response of land markets, and hence whether land market participation trends and land market rental prices respond to land scarcity. Drawing on nationally representative household survey data from Ethiopia, Malawi and Tanzania, which represent a large range of relative land scarcity conditions, we examine how land markets are responding to cross-sectional variations in land scarcity in terms of rental market participation rates, prices, and contractual arrangements. In all three countries, we document that rental market participation rates and land rental prices increase with land scarcity. We also find that land rental prices per hectare decrease with plot size. These land market responses and their heterogeneities have important implications for land distribution and land market policies.

TI  - Poverty dynamics revealed in production performance and forestry in improving livelihoods: the case of West Anhui, China
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Using distance function model and data envelopment analysis, we measure the productivity of rural households in Jinzhai, a well-known poverty County. We find that most of them improved their productivity in the 1980s, and a small number did so throughout the period of 1978-1997. For the group as a whole, however, its productivity growth and income increase were abysmal, because, among other things, expenditures increased at faster pace than revenues. This is well reflected in forestry, whose potential in reducing poverty and improving livelihoods has been constrained by government market control. Also, the wide distribution of household performance suggests that many failed to move closer to the production frontier, let alone to push it out to a higher level. Further, the adoption of the household responsibility system contributed to technical change, which played an important role in driving the productivity growth in the early 1980s, but the uncertainty associated with the contract expiration/renewal in the early 1990s led to negative technical change and thus productivity decline. Removing the institutional and technical impediments is thus essential to reduce poverty. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of devolved forest tenure reform on formal credit access for households: Evidence from Fujian, China
T2  - ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY
AB  - The Collective Forest Tenure Reform, as a devolved forest tenure reform, was first launched in Fujian, China, in 2003, issuing forestland-use certificates to and increasing forestland access for rural households, allowing households to collateralize forestland for formal credit. This study aims to identify the impact of forestland-use certificates and household forestland and further explain their channels of impact on formal credit access. The conceptual framework in the literature includes two potential channels of impact: household's willingness to formal credit access and the institutional constraint in formal credit access. An econometric analysis was conducted using panel data of household level in Fujian province from 2012 to 2016. The econometric results demonstrated that: (1) forestland-use certificates had a significantly positive impact on the households' formal credit access when it is measured only as formal credit by collateralizing forestland; (2) household forestland had significantly positive impact on households' formal credit access when it is measured as total formal credit and formal credit by collateralizing forestland; (3) households' willingness to access credit was significantly and positively affected by forestland-use certificates and household forestland, although the impact of household forestland is more certain and (4) institutional constraint in formal credit access was significantly and positively impacted by forestland use certificates but not by household forestland. Our study contains implications on the appropriate use of formal credit as a financial instrument in devolved forest tenure reform. (C) 2021 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

TI  - Costs, revenues and profits: an economic analysis of smallholder tobacco farmer livelihoods in Malawi
T2  - TOBACCO CONTROL
AB  - Background The preservation of the economic livelihood of tobacco farmers is a common argument used to oppose tobacco control measures. However, little empirical evidence exists about these livelihoods. We seek to evaluate the economic livelihoods of individual tobacco farmers in Malawi, including how much money they earn from selling tobacco, and the costs they incur to produce the crop, including labour inputs. We also evaluate farmers' decisions to contract directly with firms that buy their crops.
   Methods We designed and implemented an economic survey of 685 tobacco farmers, including both independent and contract farmers, across the 6 main tobacco-growing districts. We augmented the survey with focus group discussions with subsets of respondents from each region to refine our inquiries.
   Results Contract farmers cultivating tobacco in Malawi as their main economic livelihoods are typically operating at margins that place their households well below national poverty thresholds, while independent farmers are typically operating at a loss. Even when labour is excluded from the calculation of income less costs, farmers' gross margins place most households in the bottom income decile of the overall population. Tobacco farmers appear to contract principally as a means to obtain credit, which is consistently reported to be difficult to obtain.
   Conclusions The tobacco industry narrative that tobacco farming is a lucrative economic endeavour for smallholder farmers is demonstrably inaccurate in the context of Malawi. From the perspective of these farmers, tobacco farming is an economically challenging livelihood for most.

TI  - Human Ectoparasites Are Highly Prevalent in the Rural Communities of Northwest Ethiopia: A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSIGHTS
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ectoparasites are organisms which inhabit the skin or outgrowths of the skin of another organism (the host). Many ectoparasites are known to be vectors of pathogens, which the parasites typically transmit to hosts. Though, ectoparasites are common in the vulnerable groups and economically disadvantaged communities, there is limited evidence on its magnitude in Ethiopia. This community-based cross-sectional study was, therefore, conducted to assess the prevalence and associated factors of ectoparasites in the rural communities of northwest Ethiopia.
   METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design with structured observation was conducted among 1191 randomly selected rural households in northwest Ethiopia in May 2016. Data were collected using structured interviewer administered interview questionnaire and structured observation checklist. Prevalence of human ectoparasites in the rural communities was defined as the presence of one or more lice, fleas, bed bugs, mites, and ticks and the presence of these ectoparasites were observed by trained environmental health experts. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with prevalence of ectoparasites on the basis of adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and P values <0.5.
   RESULTS: Of a total of 1191 rural households, human or hair lice were observed in one or more of the family members in 186 (15.6%) rural households. Similarly, fleas were observed in more than half, 609 (51.1%) of rural households and bed bugs were observed in 441 (37%) rural households. Furthermore, mites and ticks were reported in 113 (9.5%) and 130 (10.9%) of the households respectively. Accordingly, one or more ectoparasites were observed in 865 of 1191 rural households. The presence of one or more ectoparasites was, therefore, found to be 72.6% (95% CI = 70%-75.1%). The prevalence of ectoparasites was statistically associated with educational status of the female head being not educated (AOR = 1.476, 95% CI = 1.001, 2.177) and absence close supervision by health extension workers (AOR = 2.151, 95% CI = 1.205, 3.843).
   CONCLUSION: The prevalence of one or more ectoparasites was high in the rural communities of northwest Ethiopia. The high prevalence was associated with education status of the female head and close supervision of households by health extension workers. Disseminating health information about intervention strategies of ectoparasites and closely supervising the rural households need to be considered.

TI  - The Local Social and Environmental Impacts of Smallholder-Based Biofuel Investments in Zambia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - High oil prices, recent commitments by industrialized countries to enhance the use of renewable energy, and efforts by developing countries to stimulate foreign investment as a pathway to development have fueled high levels of interest in the biofuel sector throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa. Zambia is no exception. A large, land-locked country with high pump prices and vast tracts of land considered by many to be "degraded" or "underutilized," investor interest in the sector has remained high despite uncertainties associated with unproven feedstocks and market fluctuations. While investment in multiple feedstock and production models may be observed, one of the primary investments has been in jatropha outgrower schemes in which small-scale farmers grow feedstock on contract with domestic and foreign investors. We assess the history and evolution of the largest such scheme in Zambia, as well as the social and environmental impacts in two districts with large numbers of outgrowers. Findings suggest that, although such a production model may hold promise for enhancing rural livelihood benefits from the emerging biofuel sector, to date, small-scale farmers have borne the brunt of the risk and uncertainty that are the trademarks of this emerging industry. We conclude with a discussion of options to minimize forest conversion and protect farmers against high-risk investments, while harnessing the potential of this business model for enhancing rural livelihoods in Zambia and elsewhere.

TI  - Households' dependence on community forest and their contribution to participatory forest management: evidence from rural Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In recent decades, there has been a major shift in natural resource conservation policies in developing countries, and community-based natural resource management has become the integral part of the policies. Nonetheless, the link between the local communities' dependence on forest resources for their livelihood and the likelihood of the success of community forest management has been understudied. Thus, this study investigates how forest dependence influences the contribution of local communities to the management of community forest, using the data collected from 190 households participating in community forest management in rural Ethiopia. It was found that the sample households derived almost 38% of their annual income from community forest. Moreover, results from mixed effects linear regression models show that forest dependence promotes contribution to collective action in the management of community forest. When households derive more income from the community forest relative to their total income, they contribute more to the management of the community forest. This suggests that the more the households depend on the community forest for their livelihood, the more they value the resource and the more they participate in the management of the forest. Thus, the results underline that the success of local communities in managing community forest may be significantly influenced by their level of dependence on the resources from the forest.

TI  - Land, development and contract farming on the Guatemalan oil palm frontier
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - Integration of smallholder agriculture into oil palm production schemes has been advocated as a strategy for rural poverty reduction in the global South, including Guatemala, where the crop had been promoted through a contentious government programme. This study, set in Guatemala's northern lowlands, challenges the official narrative that smallholder oil palm cultivation catalyses rural development and deters peasant land sales. Results indicate that oil palm expansion is accelerating land sales and provides minimal benefits, namely non-inclusive and precarious jobs. The host community is becoming increasingly susceptible to global market volatility, as oil palm puts pressure on subsistence farming and eliminates other livelihood options.

TI  - Tractor vs. animal: Rural reforms and technology adoption in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - Better institutions do not always advance technologies. China's rural reforms during the early 1980s secured land tenure for peasants and dismantled large collective farms into small household farms, which transformed tillage technology. Using a novel data set of 1755 counties from 1976 to 1988, our event study exploits the county-by-county rollout of the reform. We find that the use of tractors plummeted after the reform, while the use of draft animals surged. Post-reform tractor use was more suitable to local factor endowments and farm size. Small tractors became more popular while the number of large tractors declined.

TI  - Silenced voices, vital arguments: smallholder farmers in the Mexican GM maize controversy
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - Smallholder producers are the collective most likely to be affected by the introduction of GMOs globally, yet the least included in public debates and consultation about the development, implementation or regulation of this agricultural biotechnology. Why are the voices and arguments of smallholder farmers being excluded from national and international GM debates and regulation? In this article, we identify barriers which prevent smallholder farmers in Mexico from having a voice in public political, economic, scientific and social fori regarding the GM maize controversy. Through the analysis of empirical data from a case study in Mexico, we identify political, institutional, economic and ontological reasons that lie behind that exclusion. We conclude with an appraisal of smallholder farmers' perspectives on GM maize and their visions of Mexico's rural future, within which they demand a meaningful and rightful space.

TI  - More than individual factors; is there any contextual effect of unemployment, poverty and literacy on the domestic spousal violence against women? A multilevel analysis on Indian context
T2  - SSM-POPULATION HEALTH
AB  - Purpose: Despite successful enactment of Domestic Violence act, 2005 in India to protect Indian women from any kind of domestic violation offence, the decline trend of prevalence of spousal violence against women still remains low. The study aims to explain the factors associated with spousal violence against women through a multilevel modeling framework.
   Method: We used multilevel logistic regression model, basically here we carried out two-level random intercept model where the data base is used from National Family Health survey 2015-16 data for the fulfillment of our study objectives. A total 34,921 women, who were selected for 2015-16 domestic violence modules by NFHS, were included in this present study.
   Results: Result of multilevel logistic regression model showed that women who were belonged to poorest economic background, lived in rural areas, had low level of education or no education were at more risk in experiencing violence from their husband. Factors as large family size with more children in a household have a significant positive association with the prevalence of spousal violence against women. In case of higher level contextual variables unemployment, poverty has a crucial effect for upbringing spousal violence where higher literacy rate of a region has a strength that can reduce the probability of violence against women.
   Conclusions: The Govt. promptness as a collective responsibility to enhance educational facilities for men and women, create employment opportunities and take policies for overall economic and societal development, these may change the individual perception of a person to cause the spousal violence against women.

TI  - Remittances and rural credit markets: Evidence from Senegal
T2  - REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - This study investigates the relationship between remittances and credit markets in Senegal, focusing on rural areas where financial constraints are more challenging. Using a household fixed effects model, the findings show that remittances and credit markets are complements; namely, the receipt of remittances is positively associated with the likelihood of having a loan in a household. This means that migrants can increase the reliability of their family members and close relatives back home through their remittances, insuring themvis-a-vislenders for their credit contracts. They are the collateral or the "element of trust" in the credit contract between the borrower and the lender, representing a potential alternative in case of non-repayment. This result is robust to alternative models and various robustness tests mitigating the potential endogeneity of remittances. A detailed analysis also shows that the relationship between remittances and credit markets is mainly driven by loans taken for consumption and food, in particular, as well as loans provided by informal institutions.

TI  - Effect of the grain-growing purpose and farm size on the ability of stable land property rights to encourage farmers to apply organic fertilizers
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The application of organic fertilizer by farmers is an important method for promoting the transition of agricultural production from increasing the yield to improving the quality and safety of agricultural products and realizing the green development of agriculture. The behavior of farmers can have a direct impact on organic fertilizer application, and the active participation of farmers can effectively reduce moral hazards and improve governance efficiency. A consensus appears to have been reached regarding the importance of land property rights stability (LPRS) for farmers' organic fertilizer application (FOFA) in China; however, few studies have focused on the conditions under which LPRS exerts an effect or the extent of the effect. Moreover, the grain-growing purpose and farm size are rarely included as driving factors underlying the impact of LPRS on FOFA; thus, biased estimations are easily formed. This study analyzed the influence mechanism of LPRS on FOFA and its dependent conditions using the 2017 China Rural Household Panel Survey from Zhejiang University and conducted an empirical analysis via a logit model. The results showed that LPRS could enable farmers to apply organic fertilizer, although the degree of its impact will vary due to differences in the grain-growing purpose and farm size. Currently, selling products is not conducive to the application of organic fertilizer and will reduce the positive impact of LPRS on the application of organic fertilizer by farmers, whereas expanding the farm size will enhance the positive impact of LPRS. The government should constantly improve the methods and channels for realizing high-quality and high-priced agricultural products and fully acknowledge the role of market demand in guiding farmers' agricultural production, which will increase their enthusiasm for organic fertilizer application. The government should also improve the contract management system for land transfer to strengthen the ability of farmers to expand their farm size to fully demonstrate the role of large-scale farmers.

TI  - Scaling up of jujube-based agroforestry practice and management innovations for improving efficiency and profitability of land uses in Bangladesh
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Exploration of fruit tree-based agroforestry systems is essential for Bangladesh's agriculture in the era of climate change scenarios and shrinking agricultural land in order to ensure food and nutrition security at household and national levels. In the present study, a traditional jujube/apple kul (Zizyphus mauritiana) orchard was converted into an agroforestry system by including summer vegetables (okra and Indian spinach) and spices (ginger and turmeric) with a view to achieving greater economic return, maximizing land use and providing food and nutritional support. Results revealed that heavily pruned jujube trees in the summer season displayed negligible loss of light accessibility to understory okra and Indian spinach, which contributed to their higher yields. Conversely, the growing canopy of jujube trees exerted moderate shade at the later stages of growth that helped to attain improved yield from ginger and turmeric, which are shade loving crops. Intriguingly, jujube trees were able to utilize a substantial amount of the fertilizers and irrigation applied to the understory crops, which eliminated the need for additional inputs for jujube trees under the agroforestry system. Soil nutrient dynamics also improved in the agroforestry system as crop residues and leaf litter were left in the field. Importantly, nutritionally-rich, sweet-tasting, attractively-colored apple kul has a greater market value and the lack of vegetable productionin the summer season triggered a higher market price for Indian spinach and okra. This collectively heightened the benefit-cost and land equivalent ratios. Concisely, the current study concluded that the jujube-based agroforestry system could be endorsed as a model approach throughout Bangladesh for upgrading food, nutrition and income security.

TI  - Land Endowment and Parental Educational Investment in Rural China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Education is fundamental to enhancing the quality of life and ensuring social and economic progress. However, the divisive economic structure separating urban and rural areas in China led to insufficient educational investment in rural China, and trapped farmers' children in the agricultural sector. Land is one major asset of rural households, and can generate income or be mortgaged for credit used for educational investment. This study explored the relationship between land endowment and parental educational investment of rural households, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, breaking down the effect of land endowment into two different components for the better promotion of educational investment. Based on data from a 2018 survey in Jiangxi Province, where rural education investment is severely restricted by the level of economic development, this study shows that the income and wealth effects of land endowment exists, and both increase the probability of educational investment. The wealth effect dominates the income effect when the households managed large-scale land or owned more land with contract rights. However, when the land endowment was less than a threshold of 3.85 mu, the wealth effect was replaced by the substitution effect, which conversely restrained educational investment for small-scale farmers in rural China. These findings highlight the importance of large-scale farmland as a mortgageable, or income-generating, asset in stimulating educational investment. Therefore, China should continue adhering to reform through the market-oriented land transfer system, with the government actively playing a role in ensuring the stability of land transfer and the security of land management rights, and increasing productivity for a high agricultural income to achieve sustainable educational investment.

TI  - Impact of farmland exclosure on the productivity and sustainability of a mixed crop-livestock system in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Livestock provides numerous benefits to smallholders in sub-Saharan Africa, but also represents a potential agent of environmental degradation. Exclosures have been implemented in grazing areas for the past decades in Ethiopia and have been effective in regenerating natural vegetation, controlling soil erosion and increasing soil fertility. More recently, the principles of exclosure have been applied to farmland in pilot areas of Ethiopia. This paper analyzes the impact of eight years of farmland exclosure in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia. The performance of 'exclosed farms' (EF) - in which livestock was excluded from the farmland throughout the year - was compared to the performance of neighboring 'open grazing farms' (OF) - in which fields were open for aftermath grazing in winter. EF and OF had significantly different feed and fuel use strategies. Compared to OF, EF relied less on cereal residues, farmland grass, and livestock dung, and more on biomass produced in the communal grazing area (trees and grass) and tree biomass produced on-farm. Because of these different patterns of feed and fuel use, more biomass - in the form of crop residue, manure and compost - was available as soil amendment in EF. This translated into significantly more fertile soils and significantly higher tef yields in EF as compared to OF (1980 +/- 644 kg ha(-1) in EF vs. 1173 +/- 434 kg ha(-1) in OF). These results demonstrate that farmland exclosure is a practical pathway toward sustainable intensification. However, attention should be drawn to three points: (1) the approach impacted positively on crop productivity, but had a negligible impact on livestock productivity, (2) EF livestock still depended partially on grazing (outside of the exclosure) for their acquisition of feed, pointing at the fact that zero-grazing sensu strict may not be realistic in semi-arid areas of Ethiopia, and (3) land rehabilitation through controlled grazing may only be feasible in particular geographic locations (e.g., physical barriers preventing outside livestock to access the area, and presence of alternative grazing areas in the vicinity).

TI  - Credit Availability and Internal Migration: Evidence from Thailand
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - This study investigates the relationship between borrowing and internal migration. Exploiting the micro-finance scheme Village Fund in Thailand, it investigates the short- and medium-term effects of borrowing since the policy's introduction. Employing an instrumental variables approach, borrowing is instrumented using the inverse number of households per village at the beginning of the policy to capture potential credit availability. The findings suggest that internal migration in Thailand is not credit constrained and its interaction with credit is time-related. Borrowing reduces internal migration in the medium-term, but is found not to affect migration when the policy is first introduced.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB  - This article studies the role of social capital on cotton production efficiency and productivity for a sample of small farms in Maharashtra, India using data envelopment analysis. Input shadow prices are computed as an indicator of the importance of social capital relative to other inputs. Results suggest social capital to be the input with the highest contribution to production efficiency after land. The Luenberger indicator is used to assess the productivity improvement associated to an investment in social capital, which is found to be on the order of 12%. Undertaking collective production activities is found to play an important role in improving productivity. This is especially relevant to agricultural households facing important economic and institutional restrictions that make it difficult to increase conventional (expensive) inputs, (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A New Opportunity to Recover Native Forests in China
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB  - Despite unprecedented efforts at reforestation in recent decades, China's native forests continue to be displaced by plantations. Collective forest land (CFL)land owned by rural households/communitiesaccounts for 60% of China's total forest land and harbors nearly half of its remaining native forests. However, China's existing policy structure for native forests suffers from considerable deficiencies with regard to CFL, most notably because policies provide no mechanism for restoring native forests on CFL. Rectifying these deficiencies requires that China's management approach toward CFL forests recognize the value of forests, especially native forests, for things other than tree crop production. In particular, policies must account for biodiversity in assessing the ecological conditions and values of forests and must provide incentives to protect and restore native forests. An opportunity has arisen to incentivize native forest recovery on CFL through the newly announced mechanism of compensation for ecological protection (MCEP), introduced in May 2016 and on track to become China's umbrella policy for ecosystem protection. Currently, however, MCEP does not explicitly target CFL, and it contains no incentives for restoring native forests. Adding these elements to MCEP could herald a renaissance for China's diminishing native forests and associated biodiversity. The Chinese government should not let this opportunity slip away.

TI  - The impact of smallholder farmers' participation in avocado export markets on the labor market, farm yields, sales prices, and incomes in Kenya
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Smallholder producers in sub-Saharan Africa are often unable integrate into markets and access high-value opportunities by effectively participating in global chains for high-value fresh produce. Using data from a survey of large avocado farmers in Kenya, this study examines the determinants and impacts of smallholder-producer participation in avocado export markets on labor inputs, farm yields, sales prices, and incomes, using a switching regression framework to control for selection effects. We found that farmers who participate in export markets differ significantly from nonparticipating farmers: They are older, have somewhat larger farms, have received more training, and own more avocado trees of the Hass variety, the type favored in export markets. Living near a well-functioning avocado farmers' group is also positively associated with participation in export markets. Participation in avocado export markets will have positive impacts on incomes, revenues, prices, and labor inputs. However, there is an offsetting effect in terms of higher prices and lower volumes, reflecting the stricter quality requirements of export markets. Applying a decomposition analysis, we found that not only differences in endowment sizes, but also differences in returns from endowments in export versus domestic markets, are key to understanding differences in yields, revenues, sales prices, and labor inputs. This suggests that policymakers should not only focus on resource accumulation for farmers, but also pay attention to the inclusiveness of export market participation for smallholder farmers.

TI  - SOCIAL LIMITATIONS OF MAIZE FARMERS' ADAPTATION TO NEOLIBERAL POLICY REFORM IN MEXICO
T2  - LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH REVIEW
AB  - This article highlights the interfaces between micro-level livelihoods, social networks, and macroeconomic trends and policies. Specifically, it analyzes the role of farmer groups in livelihood adaptation of smallholder maize producers in southern Mexico. We show how neoliberal market changes have shaped the local social structure with constraining and enabling effects on households' ability to adapt, while in turn the outcomes of the neoliberal policy reforms are being (re)shaped by the responses of the farmers, thereby changing the structural context. We provide evidence for the heterogeneity of adaptation processes and show that farmers' participation influences the outcomes of neoliberal policy reforms.

TI  - Improving immunization equity through a public-private partnership in Cambodia
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB  - Objective To examine the effects on immunization equity of the large-scale contracting of primary health-care services in rural areas of Cambodia.
   Methods Data were obtained pre-intervention and post-intervention from a large-scale quasi-experiment in contracting with nongovernmental organizations to provide primary health care in nine rural districts of Cambodia between 1999 and mid-2001. Coverage targets and equity targets for all primary health-care services, including immunization of children, were explicitly included in the contracts awarded in five of nine rural districts which together have a population of over 1.25 million people. The remaining four districts used the traditional government model for providing services and were given identical targets.
   Findings After the 2.5 years of the trial, bivariate and multivariate analyses of the results suggested that although there was a substantial increase in the proportion of children who were fully immunized in all districts, children in the poorest 50% of households in the districts served by contractors were more likely to be fully immunized than poor children living in similar circumstances in districts using the government's model, all other things being equal.
   Conclusion The contracting approach described in this paper suggests a means of moving towards a more equitable distribution of immunization services in developing countries.

TI  - Effects of marketing contracts and resource-providing contracts in the African small farm sector: Insights from oil palm production in Ghana
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Smallholder farmers in developing countries often suffer from high risk and limited market access. Contract farming may improve the situation under certain conditions. Several studies analyzed effects of contracts on smallholder productivity and income with mixed results. Most existing studies focused on one particular contract scheme. Contract characteristics rarely differ within one scheme, so little is known about how different contract characteristics may influence the benefits for smallholders. Here, we address this research gap using data from oil palm farmers in Ghana who participate in different contract schemes. Some of the farmers have simple marketing contracts, while others have resource-providing contracts where the buyer also offers inputs and technical services on credit. A comparison group cultivates oil palm without any contract. Regression models that control for selection bias show that resource-providing contracts increase farmers' input use and yield. Resource-providing contracts also incentivize higher levels of specialization and an increase in the scale of production. These effects are especially pronounced for small and medium-sized farms. In contrast, the marketing contracts have no significant effects on input use, productivity, and scale of production. The results suggest that resource-providing contracts alleviate market access constraints, while simple marketing contracts do not in this context. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - VIETNAM LABOUR POLICIES AND ITS IMPACT ON RURAL WAGES: AN EXPERIENCE FROM HIRED FARM LABOURERS IN THE RED RIVER DELTA
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS-INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC E-JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose. The purpose of this article is to understand how Vietnamese policies for labour impacting on wage of rural labourers in agricultural sector. To do that, the paper particularly pays attention on analyzing wage of hired farm labourers in the Red River Delta region, the rice basket of Vietnam.
   Methodology / approach. Analyzing the above-mentioned impact of Vietnamese policies was performed by using data surveyed from 150 hired farm labourers in the Red River Delta of Vietnam. The survey on wages of rural labourers was conducted in Bac Ninh, Thai Binh and Hai Duong which are the three typical agricultural production areas in the Red River Delta in 2019. In this survey, the author interviewed 150 people who work as hired labourers in rice cultivation in Bac Ninh, clam farming in Thai Binh and pig raising in Hai Duong. The sample was randomly drawn among farm households which hire labourers in these provinces. This sample was divided into 2 groups of female and male labourers. The main purposes of this survey were to gather both qualitative and quantitative data on hired labourers including: age, gender, education level, money wage, wage in kind and other remunerations that they received from employers. Information relating to their participation in social insurance and vocational training were also collected like: number of years involving in social insurance; money that they used to purchase social insurance; frequency and time spending in vocational training courses. The personal interviews using a standard questionnaire with open and close questions were implemented separately with male and female hired farm labourers. They were interviewed in different places to ensure that their responses do not affect others. After checking for missing values, the author used the following methods: frequency distribution with mean and standard deviation for a description of respondents; cross tabulation and T-test were also used to test for differences in proportions and significant difference between groups; a linear regression model was applied to examine impact of wage regulation, social insurance and vocational training policies on wage of hired labourers in agricultural production (dependent variable was average money wage per month, it was estimated by sum of money wage and other remunerations that a labourer gets each month; independent variables were age, gender, education level and dummy variables which represented labourers' participation in mentioned labour policies).
   Results. Among policies relating to agricultural sector, the ones about minimum wage and vocational training statistically impact the most on labour wage. Longer time of vocational training brings an additional 3 USD to a labourer's monthly wage. Being supported by the policy of minimum wage, labourers can achieve higher wage when negotiating with employers. The author found that wage of a labourer who is aware of this policy is about 5 USD higher than that of others. Meanwhile, social insurance policies do not impact on wage of rural farm labourers. It is stated in the Labour Code that a part of social insurance fee of a contracted labourer is paid by his/her employer. However, hired agricultural labourers usually are excluded, because they mostly work under verbal agreements which are not specified by the Code. This loophole in the Labour Code need to be corrected in the future.
   Originality / scientific novelty. Despite the fact that industrialization process is rapidly developing in recent years, rural labour force still contributes a remarkable proportion in the Red River Delta region of Vietnam. The transferring skilled and young labourers from farm to off-farm sectors, from rural to urban areas leads to the existence of un-skilled and old-age labourers for agricultural production. This labour force is working in the poor condition with unstable and low wage jobs. However, they are not much concerned by labour policies and there is still a gap in research on their wage. Therefore, this study takes the advance to shed the light on the impact of labour policies on wage of rural farm labourers as well as to propose recommendations to adjust labour policies regarding this issue.
   Practical value / implications. The author identifies that attending vocational training and understanding of minimum wage will increase the chance for labourers to obtain higher wage.

TI  - Can public medical insurance promote rural entrepreneurship? Evidence from China
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - Using China's National Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), a heavily subsided public medical insurance (PMI) scheme, aiming at covering all rural populations in China, as a quasi-natural experiment, we find that PMI unleashes entrepreneurship in the rural economy. This finding provides supporting evidence for Arrow's risk-shifting theory and enriches the literature on the effect of PMI that has focused mainly on health impact and consumption smoothing. We also demonstrate that PMI increases entrepreneurial investments primarily through the channel of wealth effect resulting from reduced out-of-pocket medical expenses. Besides, the entrepreneurship cultivation effect of PMI is more pronounced among rural households that are wealthier, have fuller insurance coverage, or have younger heads.

TI  - Gender differences in the adoption of agricultural technology in North Shewa Zone, Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - This paper aims to analyze gender differences in the adoption of agricultural technology in the North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia. The data were collected in 2021 from 796 farm households and were analyzed using binary logit model. The results show that the adoption rate of agricultural technology in the zone by male-headed (87.3%) and female-headed households are significantly different, and adoption is lower for female-headed households (61.2%). The descriptive results reveal that female headed households had lower access to education, land size, and for that reason technology adoption. Moreover, the results show that the decision to adopt agricultural technology is significantly influenced by the gender of the household, the level of education of the householder, the marital status of the householder, participation in saving, membership of an agricultural cooperative, distance from the market and access to extension visits, access to certain credit, total arable land and livestock asset. Therefore, the results suggest that policies and programs that aim at developing and disseminating agricultural technology in the Zone should vigorously support economically less endowed but more gender-egalitarian, especially female-headed ones.

TI  - Labour turnover and considerations around work: temporary farm workers in South Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to delineates workers' labour turnover and considerations around work, in a context of informalisation of work, through a case study of temporary non-resident farm workers in the deciduous fruit sector in Ceres, South Africa.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research design is a three-phase exploratory sequential mixed-methods strategy. Findings from 29 in-depth interviews were refined, verified and ranked in four focus groups. These informed grounded indicators in a survey of 200 farm workers employed in peak season and their 887 household members.
   Findings - Considerations are informed by work-related insecurities, interpersonal workplace relationships and reproductive insecurity in the form of care of others, social linkages and residential insecurity, seemingly hierarchical. The least important considerations most thwart workers' ability to complete fixed-term contracts and account for over 70 per cent of labour turnover in the form of resignations. In sum, workers experience constrained considerations around work arising from their material, social and economic conditions.
   Originality/value - This is the first study on the labour turnover of farm workers in South Africa and the fifth globally. The research gives precedence to the voice of farm workers and is a thick description of workers' considerations around work.

TI  - Determinants and Benefits of Household Level Participation in Rural Drinking Water Projects in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - Using data from households in 45 villages in rural India, this paper finds that wealth, literacy, household and village size are often determinants of two measures of participation in community-based development projects: meeting attendance and capital cost contributions. Using propensity score matching, this study concludes that participation leads to benefits for the households that participate although these benefits are strongest in regions with higher levels of overall participation. This study finds no evidence of elite capture with both poor and wealthy households benefiting from their participation.

TI  - Proposing a Paradigm Shift in Rural Electrification Investments in Sub-Saharan Africa through Agriculture
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Almost one billion people in the world still do not have access to electricity. Most of them live in rural areas of the developing world. Access to electricity in the rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa is only 28%, roughly 600 million people. The financing of rural electrification is challenging and, in order to accomplish higher private sector investments, new innovative business models have to be developed. In this paper, a new approach in the financing of microgrid electrification activities is proposed and investigated. In this approach, agriculture related businesses take the lead in the electrification activities of the surrounding communities. It is shown that the high cost of rural electrification can be met through the increased value of locally produced products, and cross-subsidization can take place in order to decrease the cost of household electrification. The approach is implemented in a case study in Rwanda, through which the possibility of local agricultural cooperatives leading electrification activities is demonstrated.

TI  - Forest-People nexus in changing livelihood contexts: Evidence from community forests in Nepal
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Community forestry in Nepal has set an example of people's participation in forest management. The direct dependency of local people on forest resources for livelihood activities has been one of the key adhesive factors for collective efforts in forest management. Changing livelihood strategies from agriculture-based livelihoods to migration (and remittances thereof) and the service sector, introduces a new dispensation which is yet to be sufficiently understood. This paper explores the changing livelihood strategies of forest users and analyses their effects on participation in forest management. The structured household survey (n = 106), key informant interviews (n = 6), and focal group discussions (n = 3) in three community forest user groups in the mid-hills of Nepal were employed to analyze the changing livelihood strategies in the last 15 years, and to underscore their implications for forest management. We followed the recall process, and in order to ease the recall process, the reference events were discussed with the respondent. The result showed an increasing switch to non-forest dependent livelihood strategies, characterized by the emergence of non-agriculture (remittance, business, service) sectors. While there is no change in the number of CF meetings attended, and the average time spent per meeting by user households, a decreasing dependence on forests, as well as the willingness to participate in forest management was recorded. These were associated with the change in livelihood strategies from agriculture to non-agriculture-based practices. This context justifies the need for a re-think on how to stabilize the rural sector to limit rural exodus and the management of community forest resources in the mid-hills of Nepal.

TI  - Empirical Analysis on the Performance of Rural Credit Cooperative's Shareholding Reform Based on the Rationale of Isomorphic Incentive Compatibility
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Rural economic development helps reduce the income inequality in China. Existing studies show the positive effects of rural reforms, however, whether the rural credit cooperative's shareholding reform promotes rural economic development and whether effects are exerted through the synergism between agricultural producers and rural financial institutions remain unclear yet. Employing the rationale of isomorphic incentive compatibility from system science, we analyze the necessity and influencing conduit of rural credit cooperative's shareholding reform theoretically. Analysis shows that only the financial services from rural commercial banks can promote the modernized production, and thus the synergism between them drives rural economic development. Then we make empirical analysis on the effect with a Chinese provincial sample. Comparing to provinces with lower reform progress, the provinces with greater reform progress are influenced more prominently by this reform. Applying coupling coordination degree model, the coordination between agricultural production and rural banking development shows obvious increase, especially after the formal implementation of shareholding reform on rural credit cooperative. Empirical results indicate that this synergism plays positive roles in promoting agricultural growth and reducing the urban-rural income gap. In addition, these effects are more pronounced after the formal implementation of shareholding reform.

TI  - Expanding Perspectives on the Poverty Trap for Smallholder Farmers in Tanzania: The Role of Rural Input Supply Chains
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Smallholder farmers across rural landscapes remain trapped in a vicious cycle of endemic poverty where interconnected challenges limit their ability to improve their livelihoods. Our study of smallholder farmers' relationships with suppliers and several stakeholders across the Tanzanian rural agro-input supply chain offers an extended perspective on the persistence of endemic poverty and broadens the discussion on the future of sustainable food production and smallholder livelihoods. Through interviews and focus groups, we use a grounded theory methodology to develop a systemic approach to understanding the complexities of this landscape as related to smallholder agro-input sourcing activities. Our causal loop diagram framework provides a unique perspective on the poverty trap experienced by smallholder farmers in this context. Our findings may be useful in targeting practical and sustainable directions towards overcoming the poverty trap, ultimately enabling smallholders to increase wealth and improve their livelihoods through sustainable practices.

TI  - Supply-side barriers to maternal health care utilization at health sub-centers in India
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Introduction. There exist several barriers to maternal health service utilization in developing countries. Most of the previous studies conducted in India have focused on demand-side barriers, while only a few have touched upon supply-side barriers. None of the previous studies in India have investigated the factors that affect maternal health care utilization at health sub-centers (HSCs) in India, despite the fact that these institutions, which are the geographically closest available public health care facilities in rural areas, play a significant role in providing affordable maternal health care. Therefore, this study aims to examine the supply-side determinants of maternal service utilization at HSCs in rural India.
   Data and Methods. This study uses health facility data from the nationally representative District-Level Household Survey, which was administered in 2007 - 2008 to examine the effect of supply-side variables on the utilization of maternal health care services across HSCs in rural India. Since the dependent variables (the number of antenatal registrations, in-facility deliveries, and postnatal care services) are count variables and exhibit considerable variability, the data were analyzed using negative binomial regression instead of Poisson regression.
   Results. The results show that those HSCs run by a contractual auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) are likely to offer a lower volume of services when compared to those run by a permanent ANM. The availability of obstetric drugs, weighing scales, and blood pressure equipment is associated with the increased utilization of antenatal and postnatal services. The unavailability of a labor/examination table and bed screen is associated with a reduction in the number of deliveries and postnatal services. The utilization of services is expected to increase if essential facilities, such as water, telephones, toilets, and electricity, are available at the HSCs. Monitoring of ANM's work by Village Health and Sanitation Committee (VHSC) and providing in-service training to ANM appear to have positive impacts on service utilization. The distance of ANM's actual residence from the sub-center village where she works is negatively associated with the utilization of delivery and postnatal services. These findings are robust to the inclusion of several demand-side factors.
   Conclusion. To improve maternal health care utilization at HSCs, the government should ensure the availability of basic infrastructure, drugs, and equipment at all locations. Monitoring of the ANM's work by VHSCs could play an important role in improving health care utilization at the HSCs; therefore, it is important to establish VHSCs in each sub-center village. The relatively low utilization of maternity services in those HSCs that are run solely by contractual ANMs requires further investigation.

TI  - Characterizing the Last Latrine Nonowners in Rural Malawi
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Open defecation is a public health problem worldwide. Non-governmental organizations in developing countries use various approaches to increase latrine coverage, but for little-understood reasons, some of the population does not adopt latrine construction. The objective of our research was to uncover which of the factors predicting latrine construction are relevant to the last nonowners of latrines, termed laggards in the diffusion of innovations theory. In a cross-sectional study, quantitative face-to-face interviews were conducted in households in rural Malawi (N = 824) to assess the behavioral determinants of latrine construction, mental health, and leadership. Around 14% of the households interviewed did not own a latrine. Study results suggest that nonowners have limited economic resources and perceive that latrine construction is expensive, that it is difficult to find money for latrine construction, and that it needs a lot of time and effort. The last nonowners of latrines live in smaller groups than latrine owners, communicate less with others about latrine construction, and are less influenced by the opinion of their leaders. They consist, in particular, of socially vulnerable households, are younger, are less educated, often have more impaired mental health, feel more vulnerable to contracting diseases, are less aware of the latrine construction of others in the village, feel less personally obliged to construct their own latrines, and are less confident in their ability to rebuild latrines damaged by flooding. The study confirmed that the assumptions of the diffusion of innovation theory are useful in combination with the risks, attitudes, norms, abilities, and self-regulation behavior change approach for developing evidence-based behavior change strategies in developing countries.

TI  - How does rural homestead influence the hukou transfer intention of rural-urban migrants in China?
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The household registration (hukou) system in China allows hukou to be transferred in the process of rural-urban migration, and such transfers exert a significant influence on the pace of urbanization and regional development in contemporary China. Rural-urban migrants who transfer their hukou to urban areas can use the collectively-owned rural homesteads in their hometowns that they had occupied until the housing properties on these lands disappear. Understanding the role of rural homesteads in rural-urban migrants' hukou transfer intentions is of significance for efforts to promote urbanization and to formulate appropriate policies regarding hukou transfer and agricultural land management. Nevertheless, the influence of access to rural homesteads on hukou transfer intentions has gone largely underexplored. In the present study, the 2017 China Migrants Dynamic Survey data provide a basis for exploring these issues at the national level. The findings reveal that rural-urban migrants with access to a rural homestead show a 12% decrease in their propensities for transferring hukou than those without such access. Results derived from models with interaction terms suggest that two mechanisms are responsible for this outcome, an opportunity cost effect (OCE) and a revenue effect (RE). The OCE strengthens the inhibition effect of age on hukou transfer intentions but weakens the positive impact of labor contract coverage. The RE includes the absolute revenue effect (ARE) and the relative revenue effect (RRE). The former is evident in the weakened positive influence of non-village hometowns (townships, counties, or cities) on hukou transfer intentions and the latter in the strengthened positive influence of city size. The results further indicate that rural homesteads mediate hukou transfer intentions rather than affect them directly.

TI  - Does Property Rights Integrity Improve Tenure Security? Evidence from China's Forest Reform
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of land property rights integrity, subdivided into use rights, mortgage rights, and transfer rights, on household perceptions of long-term tenure security in China. To this end, we establish a theoretical framework that links China's collective forest tenure reforms undertaken since 2003 to property rights integrity and two sources of tenure (in)security based on property rights theory: forestland reallocation and expropriation. Probit models are applied in the empirical analysis to household data collected in Jiangxi province in 2011 and 2013. The results indicate that household perceptions of tenure insecurity resulting from forestland reallocation expectations are affected by transfer rights, whereas household perceptions of insecurity resulting from forestland expropriation expectations are not affected by forestland rights. We thus suggest that it is crucial for policymakers to identify the sources of local property rights insecurity before they take steps to strengthen land tenure security. This paper contributes to the available literature on the relationship between property rights integrity and tenure security by identifying different sources of tenure insecurity, emphasizing the effect of property rights integrity on long-term tenure security, and taking into account the potential endogeneity problem.

TI  - The impact of supermarket supply chain governance on smallholder farmer cooperatives: the case of Walmart in Nicaragua
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and governments are promoting cooperatives as key to linking smallholder farmers with modern markets to achieve inclusive development, yet the specifics of these supply relationships remain poorly understood. This article uses data from 51 interviews with supply chain stakeholders and a survey of 110 smallholder vegetable farmers in Nicaragua to investigate the impact of cooperative-supermarket supply chain relationships on cooperatives, and the role retailers and NGOs play in facilitating these relationships. The study found that in Nicaragua, cooperatives selling to Walmart became unstable, in contrast with the performance of cooperatives selling to local supermarket chain La Colonia. The results show that cooperative performance is impacted by an interaction between differences in the types of farmers reached by the two supermarket chains, in the performance of the NGOs involved in each supply chain, and in the supermarkets' business practices. The findings suggest that NGOs should pay more attention to buyer sourcing strategies and farmer needs when designing development interventions to link cooperatives of resource-poor farmers to markets, so as not to increase the vulnerability of smallholder farmers.

TI  - Promoting small family businesses through OCOP program and tourism activities in rural areas in Vietnam: the case of Bac Giang province
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose One Commune One Product (OCOP) program, a rural economic development program in Vietnam, aims to empower local communities for sustainable social and economic welfare development, protect the environment and preserve tradition. This study aims to employ this program associated with tourism to support small family businesses in rural areas cost-effectively. Design/methodology/approach This study used the geographic location mapping method to design tourist routes that connect tourism resources with OCOP producers. A stakeholder approach was employed to identify suggested practical works that need to be implemented while developing this tourism initiative. Findings Four rural districts of Bac Giang Province, a northern province in Vietnam known as the place of various indigenous people live and traditional craft villages. Many cultural and historical tourist sites have been chosen as sample areas for this study. By using Google map, based on the Bac Giang Tourist Map and a list of recognized OCOP products in Bac Giang Province, main tourist sites (16 locations) and small family businesses (known as cooperatives and households) that have OCOP products (17 places) in the four districts have been identified. Four notable tourist routes have been formed to propose four thematic tours (two 1-day tours and two 2 days-1 night homestay tours). Suggestions for related stakeholders to ensure the sustainability of this initiative are provided. Research limitations/implications This study is supposed to be a model of promoting small family businesses through OCOP programs and tourism activities in a sustainable way in Vietnam. The outcome of this study is in line with the stakeholder theory emphasizing the systematic connection of various stakeholders such as employees, suppliers, local communities, government agencies and others towards complex business sustainability. The results of the study cannot conclude the small family businesses in Vietnam because it adopts geographic location mapping alone. Moreover, this study focused on OCOP programs only. Future research can use other methods of primary data collection, especially from tourists' perspectives. Data triangulation can be done to explore and verify the tourist routes that have been formed according to the four thematic tours proposed. Future research could also compare hotels managed by family businesses with non-family businesses. Originality/value This study is supposed to be a model of promoting small family businesses through OCOP programs and tourism activities in a sustainable way in Vietnam.

TI  - Institutional pluralism and water user behavior in rural Africa
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The Sustainable Development Goal of providing everyone with safe and reliable drinking water services combines a moral imperative with an entrepreneurial opportunity. We examine water user behavior in the face of institutional change brought about by a professional service provider maintaining rural water infrastructure in Kenya. We ask (1) which factors are associated with households and waterpoint user groups contracting a service provider that guarantees rapid repairs; (2) how do factors vary between different management cultures defined by cultural theory of risk; and (3) can the professional service provider address the risk factors?
   By applying the cultural theory of risk framework, we capture the institutional diversity of community, public, private and failed management on the ground in dealing with operational, financial, institutional and environmental risks. To identify the factors associated with institutional change towards a pluralist arrangement - enabled by the professional maintenance service provider incubated in rural Kenya - we model data from 1215 households at actively managed handpumps with sensor data from daily handpump usage and community responses to this entrepreneurial approach.
   The predictors of behavior change of rural water users to commit to the new service provider include organizational factors of managing payments, affordability, and operational factors such as distance and water quality, which vary in importance across the management cultures. This learning can be harnessed to reduce risk and inform future policy and practice.
   As professional maintenance services for rural water infrastructure are emerging across Africa, which promise to increase value for rural water users, government, and investors through performance-based contracts, it is important for policymakers and implementers to understand which factors predict shifts in institutional behavior by water users. This research recommends seeking cooperative solutions across systems, where current policy effectively separates communities from the state or markets. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Community-based forest management and its role in improving forest conditions in Nepal
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - The status of forest conditions before and after intervention of the forestry projects in community forest in three districts of Nepal is examined. Benefits are observed from the adoption of adaptive collaborative management and collective learning and action research in three sampled districts. The adoption of regular silvicultural treatments has increased the availability of forest products to local users. Moreover, improved forest condition and smallholder livelihoods have improved, as has environmental sustainability. However, the community forestry program has several limitations and shortcomings. Elite capture, social disparity, inequitable benefit-sharing and exclusion of poor and marginalized groups from the community forestry program are notable challenges to be solved in coming years. Special attention is needed to make community forestry inclusive with equitable benefit-sharing and a pro-poor focus.

TI  - STUDY REGARDING USING SOLAR ENERGY FOR HOUSEHOLD'S SUFFICIENCY AND RURAL COMMUNITIES DEVELOPMENT IN UKRAINE
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The recent statistical data and market studies have shown that today Ukraine electricity market requires certain changes and modifications. Reform is necessary to build a new model of interaction between all participants in the energy market. The problem is too monopolized the electricity market, lack of understanding of the marketability of the category, transparency of electricity pricing, the ability to freely choose contractors and so on. Therefore, we can safely say that the new model of the energy market of Ukraine should be a powerful impetus to the energy sector development, which will lead to key indicators of sustainable economic development - energy efficiency, energy sufficiency, energy independent, use of renewable resources. This study surveyed households using solar photovoltaics to determine the prospects for solar energy in rural communities. Like methodology of research options for the development of alternative energy households, were considered traditional, technical and economic factors such as technological readiness and ability to pay, access to information and experience, if you want to implement sustainable energy solutions in rural communities. Were also identified factors that influence the household's decision to install a photovoltaic module. The survey asked about the demographic data of the respondent (gender, age and level of education) and household (household size, type of business and income) to find out their level of electricity needs. These findings indicate that the positive experience of rural users undoubtedly offers business opportunities to interact with rural households in meeting the unmet energy needs for further market growth.

TI  - Social capital as an instrument for common pool resource management: a case study of irrigation management in Sri Lanka
T2  - OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES
AB  - Although social capital is considered to be a key instrument for common pool resource (CPR) management, its effect among heterogenous players such as upstream and downstream farmers along an irrigation canal is not clear. Using a combination of lab-in-the-field experiments to measure social capital and household survey data in a unique natural experimental setting, this study shows that upstream farmers with higher trust toward the downstream farmers are more likely to be satisfied with their water usage. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that upstream farmers with higher trust demand less water and leave more water in a canal because they expect reciprocal behaviour from downstream farmers. Since the incentive structures of irrigation management closely resemble those of the standard experiments to measure social capital, this finding also provides a unique case study of the real-world relevance of these experiments.

TI  - Does cooperative membership increase and accelerate agricultural technology adoption? Empirical evidence from Zambia
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - In developing countries, agricultural cooperatives are increasingly being used to promote improved agricultural technologies and alleviate food insecurity and poverty. However, little is known about the role of agricultural cooperatives in accelerating the adoption of improved agricultural technologies. Using a comprehensive balanced household panel and varietal data, this study applied the difference-in-difference model to identify factors affecting farmers' decision to become cooperative members and the impact of cooperative membership on the adoption of improved maize, inorganic fertilizer and crop rotation. Furthermore, the study used the inverse probability weighted regression adjustment model to analyze the impact of cooperative membership on the speed of adoption of improved maize varieties. We found that cooperative membership increased the probability of technology adoption by 11-24 percentage points. Results further indicated that the average time to adoption was about 8 years, but it was shorter for cooperative members. The results showed that, on average, cooperative membership increased the speed of adoption of improved maize by 1.6-4.3 years. Generally, the results suggest the need for policies which promote farmer organizations such as cooperatives coupled with effective extension services for faster and greater adoption of improved technologies.

TI  - Farmers' resource endowment and risk management affect agricultural practices and innovation capacity in the Northwestern uplands of Cambodia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - CONTEXT: The Northwestern uplands of Cambodia underwent a massive land conversion from forest to agriculture over the last 15 years.
   OBJECTIVE: Our study conducted in Rotonak Mondol District, Battambang Province aimed at understanding farm diversity, trajectory, performance and capacity to innovate in order to identify effective interventions in a rapidly changing pioneer front.
   METHODS: Based on a survey of 365 randomly selected households, we identified 4 main farm types by a combination of Principal Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis. The survey was complemented with detailed analyses of resource use, labor management, economic productivity and adoption of innovative practices on 95 households.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The livelihood of Paddy Farms (20%) is centered on a rice-cattle combination with off-farm activities and annual upland crop farming providing cash income. The Large Farms (20%) specialize in intensive and mechanized upland crops, including orchards. The Small Farms (25%) have a diverse activity portfolio including paddy, annual upland crops, and off-farm activities. The livelihood of the Off-Farm type (35%) is largely based on low-income off-farm activities. We identified the time of arrival, initial cash and labor, relationship with local authorities, and/or social connections as key factors determining farm structures and livelihoods. This, in turn, determined farm capacities to accumulate resources during the maize boom that occurred in this region between 2006 and 2011. Based on our analysis of farm diversity, we identified interventions suitable to each farm type and opportunities for on-farm innovation through risk buffering mechanisms and strengthening of social organizations.
   SIGNIFICANCE: Like in other pioneer fronts beyond our case study in Cambodia, a reorganization of the agricultural systems is required to support the shift from essentially individualistic behaviors to more concerted actions. The emergence of new institutions, such as farmer groups and cooperatives, can build upon the specific capacity and needs of the different types of farming systems to innovate.

TI  - Collective action initiatives to improve marketing performance: Lessons from farmer groups in Tanzania
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - This study aims to examine the extent to which certain characteristics and asset endowments of smallholder farmer groups facilitate collective action initiatives to improve group marketing performance. This is approached through an evaluation of a government-led programme in Tanzania, which is attempting to increase smallholder farmers' incomes and food security through a market-oriented intervention. Findings suggest that more mature groups with strong internal institutions, functioning group activities, and a good asset base of natural capital are more likely to improve their market situation. Gender composition of groups also affects group marketing performance, as an enabling factor for male-dominated groups. Structural social capital in the form of membership in other groups and ties to external service providers, and cognitive social capital in the form of intra-group trust and altruistic behaviour are not significant factors in a group's ability to improve its market Situation.

TI  - Skewed Sex Ratios and Criminal Victimization in India
T2  - DEMOGRAPHY
AB  - Although substantial research has explored the causes of India's excessively masculine population sex ratio, few studies have examined the consequences of this surplus of males. We merge individual-level data from the 2004-2005 India Human Development Survey with data from the 2001 India population census to examine the association between the district-level male-to-female sex ratio at ages 15 to 39 and self-reports of victimization by theft, breaking and entering, and assault. Multilevel logistic regression analyses reveal positive and statistically significant albeit substantively modest effects of the district-level sex ratio on all three victimization risks. We also find that higher male-to-female sex ratios are associated with the perception that young unmarried women in the local community are frequently harassed. Household-level indicators of family structure, socioeconomic status, and caste, as well as areal indicators of women's empowerment and collective efficacy, also emerge as significant predictors of self-reported criminal victimization and the perceived harassment of young women. The implications of these findings for India's growing sex ratio imbalance are discussed.

TI  - Determinants of smallholders' entrepreneurial drive, willingness and ability to expand farming operations in KwaZulu-Natal
T2  - DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE
AB  - Government policy in South Africa to promote agricultural entrepreneurship among smallholders has failed to recognise their heterogeneity and the factors that influence their entrepreneurial drive. Furthermore, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the factors that influence smallholders' willingness and ability to expand farming operations. This study adopted multivariate general linear and ordered probit models to examine smallholders' entrepreneurial spirit. The findings suggested that the new strategic focus should aim to boost smallholder entrepreneurial drive by providing secure land use rights, access to market information and affordable irrigation systems. Policymakers must formulate enabling policies to include young women in profitable farming activities.

TI  - Risk preferences, technology adoption and insurance uptake: A framed experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
CP  - 4th Symposium on Economic Experiments in Developing Countries (SEEDEC)
AB  - Despite the yield improvements associated with the adoption of new farming technologies and modern inputs, technology diffusion amongst small-scale farmers in developing countries is slow. In this context, given the inherently risky environments in which farmers in the developing world operate, poor households are thought to be caught in a risk-induced poverty trap; specifically, poorer households that are unable to insulate themselves from consumption risk avoid these risks by opting for lower return, lower risk agriculture, and thus do not benefit from technological innovation. Using a series of laboratory experiments in a South African setting, this paper examines whether the provision of a framed index insurance product induces individuals to opt into riskier but potentially more profitable activities. To do so, we use a simple gambling task with real monetary prizes to elicit subjects' risk preferences. Elicited risk preferences are applied to the uptake of credit and insurance in a series of framed insurance simulation games. Experiment participants are small-scale and subsistence urban food growers. Overall, the results of the experiment lend empirical weight to the poverty-trap argument. Firstly, a high degree of risk aversion is evident among the sample. Secondly, risk-averse individuals are more likely to opt into traditional agriculture (reflected as traditional seeds in the experiment) and are less likely to use modern farming inputs that require financing (high-yield varieties) despite the availability of insurance. The results indicate that the provision of index insurance is not a panacea for the problem of promoting technology diffusion to small-scale farmers in the developing world, but that residual production risk and basis risk must be considered in the contract design.

AB  - This study examines how smallholder rice producers' adoption intensity for climate change adaptation practices (i.e., improved varieties, irrigation practices, direct seeded rice, integrated pest management, and adjustment in crop calendar) is influenced by access to Extension services, training, weather-related information, and membership in farmer groups or cooperatives (referred to as "institutional resources"). We use survey data collected from 359 smallholder rice producers in the Chitwan district of Nepal in 2019. The results indicate that: (1) access to institutional resources significantly enhance the likelihood of adoption of more climate change adaptation practices; (2) high intensity climate change adaptation practice measured by the adoption of three, four, and five practices significantly increases with access to institutional resources; (3) intensity of adoption of climate change adaptation practices is reduced with greater adaptation alternatives available to rice producers; and (4) lack of information and technical knowledge are the most important reasons for non-adoption of climate change adaptation practices by smallholder rice producers. The results are valuable for policy makers and planners to prioritize training opportunities and allocate scarce resources to enhance climate change adaptation and improve sustainability of rice production practices.

TI  - Does Agroforestry Adoption Affect Subjective Well-Being? Empirical Evidence from Smallholder Farmers in East Java, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Agroforestry has an essential role in reducing global poverty and maintaining environmental sustainability. However, little is known about the association between agroforestry and farmers' welfare. This study aims to estimate the factors affecting agroforestry adoption and its impact on smallholder farmers' welfare. The cross-sectional data were collected from 301 potato farmers in East Java, Indonesia. The factors affecting farmers' decision to adopt agroforestry were estimated using probit regression analysis. The subjective well-being was proxied by life satisfaction and happiness. The effect of agroforestry adoption on subjective well-being was measured by propensity score matching (PSM). The findings indicated that agroforestry adoption was positively and significantly affected by whether the land is terraced, farmers' age and education level, and farmers' participation in social activities, cooperatives, and farmers' groups. The PSM analysis shows that agroforestry adoption has a significant and positive impact on both subjective well-being indicators. Farmers who adopted agroforestry were happier and more satisfied than those who did not. The findings imply that farmers should implement agroforestry in the long term to improve their well-being.

TI  - The vulnerability and resilience of smallholder-inclusive agricultural investments in Tanzania
T2  - JOURNAL OF EASTERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - This paper compares and contrasts two cases of smallholder-inclusive agricultural investment in Tanzania and investigates the factors that shape their vulnerability and resilience to risks and uncertainties that influence their performance and viability as a development strategy. Drawing on observations and interviews with smallholders, key informants and management and staff of two large-scale rice and sugarcane estates, we discuss how the division of ownership, voice, risks and rewards in these investments affect how small- and large-scale producers negotiate their relationships in practice, highlighting the role of the state and political economy factors in shaping these dynamics. We find that a lack of transparent and reliable policies and mechanisms for governing access to land, resolving contractual disputes, and marketing the crops in question reinforces power asymmetries between the participants, undermining the potential development impacts of both investments. The two estates moreover appear to enjoy different levels of state protection that render their commercial operations more or less vulnerable and resilient to various political and economic risks. We conclude that smallholder-inclusive agro-investments in Tanzania are unlikely to fulfil both a commercial and a development function in the absence of consistent, transparent and enforceable rules of the game' that incentivize and reward responsible agricultural investment behaviour.

TI  - Application of Islamic banking instrument (Bai Salam) for agriculture financing in Pakistan
T2  - BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose - Islam prohibits interest: as a source of income or profit. The purpose of this paper is to explore the possible application of Bai Salam contract (forward sale agreement) as an alternative financial instrument in the agriculture sector of Pakistan.
   Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted in four districts of the Punjab with a specifically designed questionnaire. A convenient sampling technique was used to gather farmers' concerns related to crops inputs, output and credit requirements.
   Findings - Empirical findings conclude that agriculture income represents only up to 60 percent of the income of an average farm household. About 70 percent of fanners participate in the credit market. They need money to purchase crops inputs, to pay the labour and to hire rental machinery. Farmers believe that they can save up to 25 percent in costs if they purchase inputs on cash. The survey also discloses that middlemen are the larger financers; and buyers of crops in the rural economy whereby only 10 percent of transactions are conducted on a purely cash basis. Farmers usually return the money after the sale of the crop.
   Research limitations/implications - The concept of the paper can be extended to areas where large landlords dominate the scene. Alternatively, it can be extended towards non-farm activities such as cattle raising and poultry.
   Originality/value - The paper is a first comprehensive effort to explore the possible application of an Islamic banking instrument in the agriculture sector of Pakistan. It also suggests three possible models for financing under a Bai Salam contract. Some policy recommendations are also given.

TI  - Cattle sharing and rental contracts in an Agrarian economy: evidence from Ethiopia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Empirical evidence on the role of cattle sharing and rental contracts in agrarian economies is limited. This article is an investigation of different types of cattle sharing and rental contracts producers in rural Ethiopia adopt. It also investigates why households in rural Ethiopia rely on these contracts that are vulnerable and therefore subject to potential moral hazard problems described in earlier literature. We apply random effect probit and control function econometric methods to household panel data collected in 2005 and 2007 from two agro-ecological zones in Ethiopia. Controlling for the endogeneity of access to livestock credit, we find that contracts are spatially fragmented and better developed where population density is high and credit and insurance markets are poorly developed. We also find that contracts help cash poor and credit constrained households to improve their herd dynamics, to get access to nonlivestock resources (land, labor and cash) and share risks that could have been difficult without the contract. We show that contracts are rational responses of residents in rural communities characterized by imperfect credit and insurance services, since households with better access to credit are less likely to rely on contracts.

TI  - Analysis of the Effect of Cooperatives on Increasing Farmers' Income from the Perspective of Industry Prosperity Based on the PSM Empirical Study in Shennongjia Region
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - "Industry prosperity", as a key content of the Rural Revitalization Strategy, is an effective way to increase farmers' income, agricultural development and rural prosperity. Cooperatives have the functions of serving, assisting and enriching the people and are an important organizational carrier for achieving rural industry prosperity. This paper uses the propensity score-matching model and the field survey data of Dajiuhu Town, Shennongjia, Hubei Province to study the effect of farmers' participation in cooperatives on their net income by means of quantitative analysis. The empirical results show that (1) farmers' participation in cooperatives can improve their net income level; (2) the education level of farmers has a significant effect on their participation in cooperatives; (3) household factors, production and management characteristics and external environment also have an important effect on farmers' participation. Based on the above conclusions, this research proposes the encouragement of farmers to actively participate in cooperatives, improve their education level, vigorously improve rural infrastructure and enhance farmers' self-development efficiency to promote the continuous increase of farmers' incomes, and give rise to the positive role of cooperatives in rural development, in order to realize the revitalization and sustainable development of rural areas.

TI  - A seasonal model of contracts between a monopsonistic processor and smallholder pepper producers in Costa Rica
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - We model the contractual arrangements between smallholder pepper (Piper nigrum L.) producers and a single processor in Costa Rica. Producers in the El Roble settlement sell their pepper to only one processing firm, which exerts its monopsonistic bargaining power by setting the purchase price of fresh pepper. It also sets quality norms that result in the rejection of considerable amounts of the pepper produced by individual farmers. Because the firm is not able to produce its own raw pepper and requires a sufficiently stable flow of the fresh product to be processed into high quality white pepper, it usually relies on contracts with individual smallholders. Nevertheless, the latter considered collective marketing and took the initiative to propose a group contract with the firm. Such a contract increases the producers' bargaining power vis-A-vis the processing firm and reduces rejection rates as more care is taken when transporting the pepper to be processed. Although a group contract causes the firm to lose part of its monopsonistic rents, it also reduces transaction costs as only one contract must be negotiated instead of many. Both the firm and the producers benefit, yet from the very beginning of the association, the producers breached the group contract. We have used a mixed integer linear model which, given a set of constraints, maximises the weighted sum of the expected incomes of the firm and producers. We modelled the contract chosen by the firm and the producers according to the conditions included, such as minimum income requirements and risk considerations of both processor and farmers. We calibrated the model with data from pepper producers and the firm in El Roble. The results show that at different fresh pepper prices, the contract preferred changes with the bargaining power attributed to the firm and smallholders. However, in general, it can be concluded that fresh pepper prices high enough to cover the costs, for the farmers, of a group contract lead to lower rejection rates, and thus to more pepper of an acceptable quality, increasing the incomes of both the processor and the farmers. This is also of interest in agricultural policy-making. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - AIDS-affected children, family collectives and the social dynamics of care in Ethiopia
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - Many programmes for AIDS-affected children pursue resource-intensive and external interventions of care, and often place such children at the receiving end of the care continuum. The aim of this article is to explore from a socio-spatial perspective the capacities of families and children experiencing orphanhood and the policy significance of empowering both to address the growing challenge of orphan care in rural and urban Ethiopia. Drawing on participatory research (involving in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, story writing, photo essays, ranking, observation and household visits), the complex social dynamics of care and spatial diversities in the manifestations of the vulnerabilities, capacities, strengths, and potentials of children and their families are discussed. It is argued that rather than the lack of biological parents it is the combination of the absence of a carer and the presence of acute poverty and economic marginality that explain various forms of vulnerability in orphans and non-orphans. The article further argues that effective and sustainable care needs to be informed by identification and empowerment of 'family collectives' as sites of interventions. In doing so, it draws analytical attention to the importance of examining the socio-temporal processes of orphanhood and care, children's changing circumstances, and family collectives' variances in the capacity to provide support for them. Strategies for sustainable care should recognise the specific needs of AIDS-affected children and the resourceful ways in which they contribute to enhance the care-giving capacities of family collectives in the light of broader socio-cultural and political-economic contexts.

TI  - Heterogeneous welfare effects of farmer groups in smallholder irrigation schemes in South Africa
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS-AFJARE
AB  - This paper analyses the heterogeneous effects of membership of a farmer group on access to water, use of inorganic fertiliser, household incomes, and farm asset holdings. A sample of 401 irrigators in South Africa was analysed using propensity score matching. The study found that group membership had a positive effect on all four outcomes. Group members had an extra four days of access to water in a month, and applied at least 130 kg/ha more inorganic fertiliser, than non-group members. Group members had a higher household income per capita and more assets than nongroup members. However, the result revealed a heterogeneous effect among group members, with the benefits varying according to members' socio-economic characteristics as well as internal group dynamics. The government and private donors should continue to promote the formation and organisation of farmers into groups. The role of group membership in farming outcomes can be enhanced if smaller groups are promoted. It is also crucial that strategies for promoting trust, reciprocity and group commitment be implemented for better group outcomes.

TI  - Aggregate and distributional impacts of China's household responsibility system
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - It is 40 years since China started to abandon collective farming, with initial rural reforms in 1978 that culminated in adoption of the household responsibility system (HRS). Existing studies of impacts of these reforms do not consider nonrandom spread of the HRS, spillovers from early adopters, or distributional effects. In this paper, the synthetic control method and spatial autoregressive panel models with autoregressive errors are used to estimate impacts of the HRS that account for these features. The HRS had a significant positive effect on grain output and food supply in China, while also helping to reduce regional inequality.

TI  - On the mother and child labor nexus under credit constraints: Findings from rural India
T2  - DEVELOPING ECONOMIES
AB  - There is an emerging consensus that lack of credit is a major cause of child labor and inequality in the intrahousehold distribution of resources. At the same time, patterns in how children spend their time appear to be strongly influenced by maternal employment decisions. This paper includes an assessment of the effect of credit constraints on maternal employment and that of maternal employment on the intrahousehold allocation of labor, a nexus which has been left unexplored by existing studies. Three findings emerge: (1) a mother is more likely to work outside when a household lacks resources, and her domestic labor can be easily replaced by other members, (2) credit market accessibility is one of the major determinants of maternal labor, and (3) elder daughters assume a large part of the burden of maternal employment by providing domestic labor. Under binding credit constraints, results of this study support the collective as opposed to the unitary model of households.

TI  - Effect of householder characteristics, production, sales and safety awareness on farmers' choice of vegetable marketing channels in Beijing, China
T2  - BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose - Farmers' selection of vegetable marketing channels directly affects their income and is important to stable vegetable supply and food control. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the farmers' selection behavior of vegetable marketing channels, and to determine the key factors which affected farmer' decision making.
   Design/methodology/approach - A total of 191 valid questionnaires were collected from 50 villages in seven main vegetable production districts in Beijing urban areas from September to December 2015, yielding a response rate of 86.8 percent. The multinomial logit model was used for analysis in this study.
   Findings - The results revealed that the farmers mainly selected farmers' market, cooperative, and wholesaler to sell their vegetables, which comprised 96.57 percent of total vegetable sales. Estimation results showed that cooperative, vegetable acreage, price satisfaction, and slow sales were most important factors which influence positively the probability of opting to sell vegetables at a cooperative rather than at the farmer's market. For wholesalers, gender of the household head and cooperative had most significantly negative effect, and age had a positive impact on farmer's choice of market channels.
   Originality/value - The results and implications obtained in the present study could help policymakers to establish a scientific-based and reasonable policy to encourage vegetable producers to participate in the circulation of vegetables in Beijing and guarantee their income in vegetable supply chain. The suggestions of this study could also be used for the improvement of the vegetable sector in other cities facing similar issues.

TI  - Synergistic impacts of agricultural credit and extension on adoption of climate-smart agricultural technologies in southern Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Institutional credit and extension services are critical inputs that can reduce scaling challenges in agricultural development interventions if accessed by farmers. Using household level survey data from Zimbabwe and Malawi, this article seeks to contribute to the existing literature by examining impacts of separate and joint access to credit and extension services on climate-smart agricultural (CSA) technologies adoption. Using inverse-probability weighting regression adjustment and propensity score matching this study found out that access to either extension or credit significantly progresses CSA technology adoption. However, access to extension services only proved to be more effective in enhancing CSA technology adoption than access to credit alone. More importantly, results show enhanced collective impact of simultaneous access to credit and extension on CSA technology adoption. Further, joint impacts of credit and extension on adoption were found to be less pronounced in youthful and women farmer groups compared to their old and male farmer group counterparts respectively. Results call for prudent policy and institutional strategies in improving access to credit and extension services in Malawian and Zimbabwean smallholder farming that are mindful of disadvantaged groups such as youth and women farmer groups in order to improve adoption and upscaling of CSA technologies. Possible options include; improving number of extension workers at village level, increasing youth and women extension agent numbers, capacity building of extension personnel and institutions, and increasing financial support to national extension programs.

TI  - INCENTIVIZING THE ADOPTION OF BIOFORTIFIED RICE FOR INCREASING FARMERS' PRODUCTIVITY AND INCOME DURING COVID19 ERA: EVIDENCE FROM SMALLHOLDER FARMERS IN NIGERIA
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This research examined the challenges and factors affecting the behaviours of rice farmers towards adopting the bio-fortified rice technology in the Covid-19 pandemic era. The trust of the paper rests on despite the awareness and support to farmers to adopt the new bio-fortified rice technology and the importance of technology in farmers' welfare; the acceptance has been low and slow. More importantly, research in this area has neglected the factors influencing the adoption of biofortified rice and its impact on the production and income of the farmers in Nigeria during the pandemic era. This study used a multi-stage sampling procedure to select 540 (200 non-adopters and 340 adopters) rice, farmers. Data were collected using computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI) and analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics. The major result shows that the socioeconomic profiles of the adopters were better than the non-adopters. The decision by the farming households to adopt biofortified rice was significantly influenced by the household's income level, extension agent contact, credit, association with cooperatives and availability of information. In addition, adopting biofortified rice increased the adopters' income across all categories of inc12ome considered. The rice farmers faced general and specific Covid-19 challenges that constrained them from adopting the technology. It was recommended, among others, that emergency agencies whose duties are to mitigate the effects of a pandemic-related crisis should have offices in the rural areas to have close contact with the information needs of the rural farmers in times of emergency.

TI  - Agroforestry within REDD plus : experiences of an indigenous Embera community in Panama
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) has become central to efforts to mitigate climate change. Approximately 10 % of the world's forests are managed by local and indigenous peoples. Agroforestry may provide these communities with a means to engage in carbon offsetting initiatives without forfeiting access to, or benefits from, forests. Here, we present an analysis of social and ecological data from a four-year-old, reforestation-based carbon-offset project on the collective lands of Ipeti-Embera, Panama. Mixed-species agroforests or timber-only plots were established by a subset of community members under voluntary carbon-offset agreements with a private client. We (1) describe how plot carbon accumulation trajectories were related to species composition; (2) determine if established agroforests are likely to meet carbon sequestration targets by the end of the 25-year project period; (3) describe the motivations and experiences of participants who chose to establish agroforests; and (4) compare socio-economics of participants versus non-participants. Our study provides data on early mortality, tree growth and the carbon sequestration capacity of 29 species that are commonly used by small farming households in Latin America and elsewhere. The study highlights strategies for reducing risks associated with agroforestry as a carbon sequestration strategy in the context of carbon offset projects, such as the replanting of dead trees and the establishment of a carbon buffer. We also provide evidence to counter claims that offset projects could amplify inequality in rural communities as participants to agroforestry, when compared to non-participants, were not remarkable in terms of their assets or wealth. Overall, this case study provides an encouraging example of how agroforestry may help forest communities engage with REDD+ in a way that benefits both their livelihoods and the global climate change agenda.

TI  - Land titling, land reallocation experience, and investment incentives: Evidence from rural China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The impacts of land titling on investment incentives among farmers with different land reallocation experiences are studied in this work. Ordered Probit model and 2SLS are employed to estimate the survey data collected from 2704 households in rural countries in China. We find that, generally, land titling can substantially promote investment incentive among farmers. However, the impacts vary among farmers with different land reallocation experiences. Specifically, land titling positively affects farmers without land reallocation experience, but it negatively affects those farmers who experienced big reallocation. Land titling has an investment incentive effect on China's special agricultural land system, where farmers only have contract rights of land. However, big reallocation should be heavily restricted to guarantee the investment incentive effect of land titling.

TI  - Does the Collective Forestland Tenure Reform Promote Rural Households' Forestry Inputs? Based on Dual Perspectives of Rural Households' Divergence and Inter-Generational Differences
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - As the most direct subject of collective forestland tenure reform, rural households' forestry production behavior is an important guarantee for the promotion of sustainable forestry development. Based on the survey data of 12,760 rural households in 9 provinces in China, we construct a theoretical analysis framework of the impact of collective forestland tenure reform on rural households' forestry inputs from the perspective of rural household differentiation and inter-generational differences, and elucidate the mechanism of the effect of collective forestland tenure reform on rural households' forestry inputs in the context of rural household differentiation and inter-generational differences. The results of the empirical analysis show that collective forestland tenure reform significantly increases rural households' forestry inputs; this effect has a differentiated impact on rural households with different degrees of differentiation and inter-generational differences. Although the collective forestland tenure reform provides a good institutional environment for households to increase the enthusiasm of forestry inputs, the positive incentive effect of collective forestland tenure reform tends to decline as the degree of households' differentiation and inter-generational differences deepen. Therefore, this research tries to provide an "indirect" policy adjustment idea to deepen the policies related to collective forestland tenure reform by starting from the differentiation of households and inter-generational differences.

TI  - Environmental resource consumption pattern in rural Arunachal Pradesh
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The paper attempts to study the impact of household-level heterogeneity on the degree and nature of forest dependency under conditions of declining forest cover and institutional diversity. Based on household-level primary data from twelve villages in five districts of Arunachal Pradesh, India, the study brings out the significance of forest resources as a source of livelihoods in the Eastern Himalayan region. The findings suggest that CPRs play a significant role in the livelihoods strategies of the rural poor. Household characteristics such as size of landholdings, education and distance from markets significantly affect forest dependency. Although the absolute amount of forest income derived by the rich is higher, in relative terms the poor depend more on CPRs like forest. It is not only that the extent of forest dependency varies across various income groups, with gradual commercialisation of the forest economy, the nature of dependency on forest across income groups has undergone significant changes as well. The rural rich extract more high-value, commercial forest products, while the poorer households depend on community forests for their basic survival needs. The diversity in the pattern of resource use is one of the key challenges before the local-level institutions governing access to the CPRs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Adoption of Contract Farming and Precautionary Savings to Manage the Catastrophic Risk of Maize Farming: Evidence from Bangladesh
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Agricultural production faces several types of risk, and risk management tools vary by place, season, and crop type. Most farmers use multiple risk-minimizing tools to reduce the effects of various hazards. However, previous research has overlooked the potential connections between different risk management tool utilization decisions. This study examines farmers' decisions of adopting risk management tools (contract farming and precautionary savings) and investigates the impacts of various factors on farmers' risk management decisions by using bivariate and multinomial probit models. The study was carried out in four different agro-ecological regions of Bangladesh with 350 farmers chosen through multistage stratified random sampling procedures. The findings revealed that the farmers' decisions towards adopting risk management tools are correlated, and the adoption of one risk management tool may induce farmers to adopt other risk management tools at that time. Moreover, the results revealed that age, education, income, and land ownership are the major factors affecting the adoption of risk management tools, and most farmers are risk-averse in nature. Both models provide interpretation and information for the development of a better understanding of the current situation of rural farm households, which may serve as a platform for policymakers who are anticipating appropriate risk management tools for the farmers.

TI  - Impact of cash crop cultivation on household income and migration decisions: Evidence from low-income regions in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB  - This study examines the impact of cash crop cultivation on household income and migration decisions, using survey data collected from low-income regions in China. Given farmers decide themselves whether to cultivate cash crops, an endogenous treatment regression model that accounts for potential selection bias issue is used to analyze the data. The empirical results show that cash crop cultivation exerts a positive and statistically significant impact on household income, but it does not affect household migration decisions significantly. The disaggregated analyses reveal that cash crop cultivation significantly increases farm income but decreases off-farm income.

TI  - Attitudes of local people towards collective action for forest management: the case of participatory forest management in Dodola area in the Bale Mountains, Southern Ethiopia
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The theory of planned behaviour was applied to study the attitude and intention of households towards participating in collective forest management (tree planting) activity. Households were randomly selected from 22 forest user groups. The results indicate that the success of planting activities in terms of survival rate of seedlings has a strong effect in motivating households to participate in planting. Although households in general show a positive attitude and intention to participate in tree planting, there were significant differences among households on the basis of socio-economic characteristics. Dependence on crop income, possession of bigger farmlands and better physical assets, and higher education level are positively related to intention to participate in planting activity. On the other hand, dependence on forest income is negatively related to attitude and intention. A continuous exchange of ideas and information between user groups and the government counterparts that provide technical support and advice is recommended.

TI  - Risk attitude effects on Global-GAP certification decisions by smallholder French bean farmers in Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB  - Knowledge on the link between French beans farmers' attitudes toward risks and Global-GAP compliance decisions is limited in Kenya. A social experiment (Lottery games involving real pay-offs) was implemented on 119 randomly selected farmers to solicit risk attitudes and Binary Logit Model to determine the effect of risk attitudes on compliance decisions. Majority of non-certified farmers (24 percent) were risk averse relative to certified farmers (4.3). Non-certified farmers were more averse towards losses (p = 0.062 IMD = 0.50). Farmer's probability weighting (p = 0.046), aversion to loss (p = 0.094), contract farming (p = 0.000) and daily household expenditure per adult equivalent significantly and negatively affected compliance decisions while risk aversion (p = 0.081), annual asset value (p = 0.092) and acreage under French beans (p = 0.033) significantly and positively affected compliance decisions. The results suggest that crop insurance and affordable credit is important in mitigation of potential production and marketing risks in French bean farming. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Historicising agrarian transformation. Agricultural commercialisation and social differentiation in Wolaita, southern Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF EASTERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - This article discusses contemporary agrarian transformation in southern Ethiopia from the perspective of how policies of agricultural commercialisation engender new patterns of rural social differentiation and politicisation of the land issue in the rural setting. By presenting a case of biofuels production through contract farming in Wolaita, the paper sheds light on the historical trajectory of agrarian transformation to elucidate the tensions of the current project of commercialisation. The article concludes that commercialisation of smallholder agriculture is a crucial feature of the country's strategy for socio-economic and political transformation and constitutes one of the main defining aspects of the self-declared developmental state' in Ethiopia. The current trajectory in Wolaita sees tangible rural social differentiation for the first time since the 1975 land reform. Beyond the success or failure of individual cases, commercialisation reflects two main layers of tension, present also elsewhere in Ethiopia's rural areas. The first has to do with the relationship between bureaucratic centralism and economic liberalisation; the second emerges from the implications of rural social stratification to the redefinition of the ruling elite's political consensus.

TI  - Economic Burden of Malaria and Associated Factors Among Rural Households in Chewaka District, Western Ethiopia
T2  - CLINICOECONOMICS AND OUTCOMES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: There has been a remarkable decline in the burden of malaria in the past few decades in Ethiopia. However, malaria remains a major impediment to both health and economic development in Ethiopia, with 60% of the population at risk of contracting malaria. Hence, this study aimed to estimate the economic burden of malaria among rural households in Chewaka district, Buno Bedele zone, Oromia regional state, Western Ethiopia.
   Methods: Community-based cross-sectional study design was employed to estimate the economic burden of malaria at the household level from August 13 to September 2, 2018. A retrospective costing approach was employed, and cost was estimated from the perspective of households. The study included malaria expenditure of households during a one-year period (July 9, 2017 to July 9, 2018). Data were collected from 765 randomly selected households and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of the economic burden of malaria among rural households and all variables with P-value <0.05 were considered as statistically significant at 95% CI.
   Results: On average, each household comprised 2 malaria cases (SD 1.1) in the past one-year period and the prevalence of malaria in the study setting was 32% (95% CI, 30.5-33.2). The average annual income of households was US$626.7 (95% CI, 590.4-663.0). The mean annual cost of malaria illness to households was US$16 (95% CI, 14.8-17.2), and most of this cost (78%) was contributed by the indirect costs. In every household, on average, patients and companions or caregivers lost 3.4 productive workdays due to malaria illness, respectively. Fourteen households out of 100 spent more than 5% of their annual income on malaria treatment and hence, they were prone to high economic burden or catastrophic costs. Household level economic burden of malaria was determined by the sex and educational status of household head, means of transportation to treatment center, the episodes of malaria, the number of malaria "ill days" and type of malaria diagnosis.
   Conclusion: Malaria continues to significantly impose an economic burden on the rural households of Ethiopia. Hence, the national malaria program needs to recognize and address the catastrophic costs associated with malaria illness. Efforts should be made to ensure universal access to and utilization of malaria prevention, diagnosis, and treatment services.

TI  - The impact of cooperatives' transportation services on farm income: Evidence from tobacco farmers in Guizhou, China
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - In mountainous areas, access to markets and transportation services is particularly important for farmers. Following government initiatives, agricultural cooperatives in China have begun to offer transportation services as part of their service portfolio. This study estimated the impact of cooperatives' transportation services on tobacco farmers' farm income. Using survey data from 337 households in Guizhou Province, China, a two-step control function was used to correct for selection bias. Results showed that access to transportation services increased yearly farm income by up to 4,636 RMB Yuan. The possible reasons for this large increase are discussed and conclusions were drawn for rural development policy. [EconLit citations: Q13, L23]

TI  - Land rental development via institutional innovation in rural Jiangsu, China
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that there are two important preconditions for encouraging land rental in agriculture: out-migration and the enhancement of security and transferability of land rights. Focusing on the latter, we scrutinize the impacts of institutions aimed at facilitating land use dynamism, particularly the Rural Shareholding Cooperatives (RSCs), which have been established recently at the local level in rural China. In general, we find that RSCs can pave the way for the extension of property rights to farmland and promote more efficient land use patterns. Using survey data collected from 300 village committees in rural Jiangsu province, we estimate the effectiveness of RSCs in encouraging land rental. Our analysis reveals that RSCs can serve as intermediate agents for reducing transaction costs associated with exchange of land use rights and, thereby, not only encourage land rental/consolidation activities but also enable the entry of non-farm household entities into the farm business.

TI  - Role of the new rural cooperative medical system in alleviating catastrophic medical payments for hypertension, stroke and coronary heart disease in poor rural areas of China
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Hypertension, stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) are common diseases that impose a heavy burden on patients and their families, particularly on those living in poor areas. This study examined catastrophic medical payments faced by patients with these diseases and the effectiveness of the new rural cooperative medical system (NRCMS) at alleviating the impact of the said diseases in fourth-class rural areas (i.e. those with annual income of less than RMB1500/$240.2 per capita) of China.
   Methods: Data on medical payments, including out-of-pocket and NRCMS-reimbursed expenses were collected through self-administered questionnaires. The pre- and post-reimbursement (via the NRCMS) prevalence of household poverty, catastrophic medical payment (CMP) incidence (H-cat), mean CMP gap (G(cat)), mean positive CMP gap (MPG(cat)) and other determinants of CMP incidence were identified.
   Results: Out-of-pocket payments for treatment of hypertension, stroke and CHD averaged RMB580.1/$92.9, RMB3028.4/$484.8 and RMB1561.4/$250.0 per capita, respectively, in 2008. H-cat, G(cat) and MPG(cat) due to the three diseases were 17.0%, 16.6% and 97.6%, respectively, and reimbursement through the NRCMS reduced them to 13.5%, 11.8% and 87.4%, respectively. The difference between pre- and post-reimbursement H-cat was not statistically significant. After adjusting the covariates for age [OR = 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19-2.95], education (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.07-2.27), marital status (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.11-2.51), occupation (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.34-2.85), annual income (OR = 4.95, 95% CI = 3.28-7.48), the multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with stroke (OR = 3.94, 95% CI = 2.38-6.51) or CHD (OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.38-3.65) were more susceptible to CMP compared with patients with hypertension only.
   Conclusions: Out-of-pocket medical spending on hypertension, stroke and CHD imposes a heavy financial burden on the residents of fourth-class rural areas of China. The NRCMS has some impact on reducing catastrophic medical payments associated with these diseases, but improvement of the reimbursement rate is necessary to further improve its effectiveness.

TI  - Resilience and Circularity: Revisiting the Role of Urban Village in Rural-Urban Migration in Beijing, China
T2  - LAND
AB  - Recent policies in China have encouraged rural-urban circular migration and an "amphibious" and flexible status of settlement, reacting against the recent risks of economic fluctuation in cities. Rural land, as a form of insurance and welfare, can handle random hazards, and the new Land Management Law guarantees that rural migrants who settle in the city can maintain their rights to farmland, homesteads, and a collective income distribution. Existing studies have pointed out that homeland tenure can reduce migrants' urban settlement intentions (which is a self-reported subjective perception of city life). However, little is known about how the rural-urban circularity and rural tenure system (especially for those still holding hometown lands in the countryside) affect rural migrants' temporary urban settlements (especially for those preferring to stay in informal communities in the host city). The existing studies on the urban villages in China have focused only on the side of the receiving cities, but have rarely mentioned the other side of this process, focusing on migrants' rural land tenure issues in their hometowns. This study discusses the rationale of informality (the urban village) and attests to whether, and to what extent, rural migrants' retention of their hometown lands can affect their tenure security choices (urban village or not) in Chinese metropolises such as Beijing. Binary logistic regression was conducted and the data analysis proved that rural migrants who kept their hometown lands, compared to their land-loss counterparts, were more likely to live in a Beijing urban village. This displays the resilience and circularity of rural-urban migration in China, wherein the rural migrant households demonstrate the "micro-family economy", maintaining tenure security in their hometown and avoiding the dissipation of their family income in their destination. The Discussion and Conclusions sections of this paper refer to some policy implications related to maintaining the rural-urban dual system, protecting rural migrant land rights, and beefing up the "opportunity structure" (including maintaining the low-rent areas in metropolises such as Beijing) in the 14th Five Year Plan period.

TI  - Participatory computer simulation to support collective decision-making: Potential and limits of stakeholder involvement
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - System models in agriculture and natural resource management are usually developed by researchers to advise policy makers on the likely outcomes of alternative scenarios. Except for data collection, stakeholders-like farm households-are rarely involved in the research process. Companion modeling (ComMod) has been developed as a modeling approach to include various stakeholders in a continuous feedback loop between researchers and stakeholders. Whereas other ComMod approaches have used role playing games as an interface between researchers and stakeholders-assuming that stakeholders have difficulties understanding a computer model-this paper explores the potential of a participatory modeling approach in. which stakeholders are directly confronted with the model by assessing its assumptions, interpreting simulation results, and suggesting scenarios.
   The approach is applied to two villages in a watershed in northern Thailand. One lowland village, populated by farmers of mostly Thai ethnic origin, depends partially on an upland village inhabited by farmers of Hmong ethnic origin for its water supply. Water scarcity has led to conflicts between these two villages in the past.
   In three rounds of participatory simulation sessions the potential of the ComMod model was tested. Our findings confirm that researchers face particular challenges in making local stakeholders understand the model as a reproduction of reality and not as reality itself. The idea of a scenario as a hypothetical situation was also difficult to convey. An ex-post analysis among participants showed that farmers who attended several sessions had a clear understanding of the model and one-third of the participants thought it useful to exchange points of view with the other community and to define new collective rules for water sharing. Applying ComMod in a context that is characterized by social tensions and power differentials, however, needs careful consideration of the potential implications on less powerful actors.

TI  - Improved production systems for traditional food crops: the case of finger millet in western Kenya
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Increasing agricultural productivity through the dissemination of improved cropping practices remains one of the biggest challenges of this century. A considerable amount of literature is dedicated to the adoption of improved cropping practices among smallholder farmers in developing countries. While most studies focus on cash crops or main staple crops, traditional food grains like finger millet have received little attention in the past decades. Traditional food grains have however an important potential to improve food security, reduce micronutrient deficiencies, and enhance smallholder adaptation to climate change. The present study aims to assess the factors that influence adoption decisions among finger millet farmers in western Kenya. Based on cross-sectional household data from 270 farmers, we estimated a multivariate probit model to compare the adoption decisions in finger millet and maize production. While improved practices such as the use of a modern variety or chemical fertilizer are relatively well adopted in maize production, they are less common in finger millet production. Social networks as well as access to extension services play crucial roles in the adoption of improved finger millet practices, while the same variables are of minor importance for the adoption of improved maize practices. A Cobb-Douglas production function shows a positive effect of modern varieties and chemical fertilizer on finger millet yields.

TI  - The effect of consensus on demand for voluntary micro health insurance in rural India
T2  - RISK MANAGEMENT AND HEALTHCARE POLICY
AB  - Introduction: This study deals with examining factors that catalyze demand for community-based micro health insurance (MHI) schemes. We hypothesize that demand for health insurance is a collective decision in the context of informality and poverty. Our hypothesis challenges the classical theory of demand which posits individual expected diminishing utility. We examine factors beyond the traditional exogenous variables.
   Methods: This study uses data collected through a household survey conducted among self-help groups in rural India in the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar before the implementation of three community-based MHI schemes. Additional information was extracted from the management information system maintained by the schemes. At the first step, we compared the estimated probability of a household joining the scheme (obtained by applying logistic regression) to the actual uptake. In the next step, we analyzed the role of consensus within groups on demand for health insurance (by applying ordinary least square regressions).
   Results: The results of the logistic regressions indicated that exogenous household characteristics could not explain the probability of joining health insurance. We observed that group consensus on several critical issues, such as the price of the insurance, perceptions about exposure to adverse health events, and perceptions of the quality of service of local health care providers, was the important determinant of demand for insurance.
   Conclusion: Based on the analysis, we reject the null hypothesis that demand is an individual decision at the household level. The analysis upholds the assumption that demand is created through a process of consensus building on perceptions of risk exposure, welfare gains from the insurance, and quality of local health care provision. Success in catalyzing demand for health insurance in the informal sector depends on encouraging group dialog.

TI  - Interactions between Carbon Sequestration and Shade Tree Diversity in a Smallholder Coffee Cooperative in El Salvador
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Agroforestry systems have substantial potential to conserve native biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. In particular, agroforestry systems have the potential to conserve native tree diversity and sequester carbon for climate change mitigation. However, little research has been conducted on the temporal stability of species diversity and aboveground carbon stocks in these systems or the relation between species diversity and aboveground carbon sequestration. We measured changes in shade-tree diversity and shade-tree carbon stocks in 14 plots of a 35-ha coffee cooperative over 9 years and analyzed relations between species diversity and carbon sequestration. Carbon sequestration was positively correlated with initial species richness of shade trees. Species diversity of shade trees did not change significantly over the study period, but carbon stocks increased due to tree growth. Our results show a potential for carbon sequestration and long-term biodiversity conservation in smallholder coffee agroforestry systems and illustrate the opportunity for synergies between biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. Interacciones entre el Secuestro de Carbono y la Diversidad de arboles de Sombra en una Cooperativa de Cafe de Pequenos Agricultores en El Salvador
   Resumen Los sistemas agroforestales tienen potencial sustancial para conservar la biodiversidad nativa y proporcionar servicios ecosistemicos. En particular tienen el potencial para conservar la diversidad nativa de arboles y secuestrar carbono para la mitigacion del cambio climatico. Sin embargo, se han conducido pocas investigaciones sobre la estabilidad temporal de la diversidad de especies y el capital de carbono superficial en estos sistemas o las relaciones entre la diversidad de especies y el secuestro de carbono superficial. Medimos los cambios en la diversidad de arboles de sombra y el capital de carbono de estos mismos arboles en 14 terrenos de 35 hectareas de una cooperativa de cafe a lo largo de 9 anos y analizamos las relaciones entre la diversidad de especies y el secuestro de carbono. El secuestro de carbono tuvo una correlacion positiva con la riqueza inicial de especies de arboles de sombra. La diversidad de especies de estos arboles no cambio significativamente a lo largo del periodo de estudio, pero el capital de carbono incremento debido al crecimiento de los arboles. Nuestros resultados muestran un potencial de secuestro de carbono y una conservacion de biodiversidad a largo plazo en los sistemas agroforestales de pequenos agricultores de cafe; ilustran tambien la oportunidad de sinergias entre la conservacion de la biodiversidad y la mitigacion del cambio climatico.

TI  - The demand for credit, credit rationing and the role of microfinance Evidence from poor rural counties of China
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the demand for credit and credit rationing conducted by formal, informal and emerging microfinance lenders in the four poor counties of China.
   Design/ methodology/ approach - This paper extends the existing studies on credit rationing in rural China by comparing the determinants of credit rationing by three different lenders, the formal lenders rural credit cooperatives ( RCCs), the informal lenders and the new microfinance institutions ( MFIs).
   Findings - MFIs are capable of reaching out to the even poorer households if they develop the loan products based on the income and expenditure flows of these households.
   Research limitations/ implications - The determinants of credit rationing by three types of institutions are estimated separately.
   Practical implications - RCCs in China shall change their policy of discrimination against female- headed households. RCCs shall also simplify the loan application procedures and assess the clients based on their repayment capacities rather than the age or assets alone. RCCs could learn from MFIs to use incomes from migrant workers as a criterion to assess the loan applicants.
   Social implications - gender equity for loan access.
   Originality/ value - This paper extends the existing studies on credit rationing in rural China by comparing the determinants of credit rationing by three different lenders, the formal lenders ( RCCs), the informal lenders and the new MFIs.

This study aims to analyze the association between social networks and its structure on the decision of households' participation in community. A households survey was conducted in Yanliang district of Shaanxi province of China and 393 households were targeted. An ordered multi classification logistic regression model was utilized to empirically analyze the association between the variables. The results showed that social networks have a significant positive impact on the households' participation in cooperatives/communities. Among other variables, network interaction, network learning, network trust, and households' participation in green energy technologies and cooperatives/community showed significant and positive correlation, but the variable network reciprocity was found to be negatively correlated to the adoption of green energy technologies. Study findings further revealed that, there is an interaction effect in the participation of households' behavioral decision-making and joining cooperatives. Furthermore, the social experience of the head of the household and the source of income of the family showed a significant positive association with households' participation in cooperatives/communities. Based on the study findings, it is suggested that the utilization and cultivation of households' social network, service level of cooperatives need to be improved.

TI  - Contract farming and rice production efficiency in Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose Even though many studies identify positive effects of contract farming (CF) on the livelihood of farmers, the use of CF as a tool to increase farm performance is unsettled debate. Information on CF is relatively not available in staple food chains. Theoretical considerations have shown that there are challenges in employing CF in staple food chains such as rice. With the increasing trend of rice CF in Ghana, it is very critical to establish its performance in rice production in Ghana. It is therefore imperative to analyse the impact of CF on the performance of smallholder rice farmers. Design/methodology/approach A survey was conducted where 350 rice farmers selected through a stratified sampling technique using structured questionnaires were interviewed. Descriptive and inferential statistics including stochastic frontier analyses and endogenous treatment effect regression were used to analyse the data. Findings The results from the endogenous treatment effect regression model show that CF improves rice farmers' technical, allocative and economic efficiencies by 21, 23 and 26%, respectively. Farm size and CF were identified as common factors influencing technical, allocative and economic efficiency measures of the farmers positively. It further identified age of farmer, educational level and household labour as factors influencing farmers' participation in CF positively. Research limitations/implications It is recommended that CF is a good tool to enhance rice production efficiency, and hence, farmers should be encouraged to participate in CF as strategy to enhance the local rice production in Ghana. Social implications The outcome of this study has the potential to influence rice production in the country. The country is a net importer of rice and just about 35% self-sufficient in rice production. Originality/value This study is the first to assess performance of CF in rice crop production in Ghana and also one of the few to use efficiency as a performance measure.

TI  - Does livestock protect from malaria or facilitate malaria prevalence? A cross-sectional study in endemic rural areas of Indonesia
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
AB  - Background: Ever since it was discovered that zoophilic vectors can transmit malaria, zooprophylaxis has been used to prevent the disease. However, zoopotentiation has also been observed. Thus, the presence of livestock has been widely accepted as an important variable for the prevalence and risk of malaria, but the effectiveness of zooprophylaxis remained subject to debate. This study aims to critically analyse the effects of the presence of livestock on malaria prevalence using a large dataset from Indonesia.
   Methods: This study is based on data from the Indonesia Basic Health Research ("Riskesdas") cross-sectional survey of 2007 organized by the National Institute of Health Research and Development of Indonesia's Ministry of Health. The subset of data used in the present study included 259,885 research participants who reside in the rural areas of 176 regencies throughout the 15 provinces of Indonesia where the prevalence of malaria is higher than the national average. The variable "existence of livestock"and other independent demographic, social and behavioural variables were tested as potential determinants for malaria prevalence by multivariate logistic regressions.
   Results: Raising medium-sized animals in the house was a significant predictor of malaria prevalence (OR = 2.980; 95% CI 2.348-3.782, P < 0.001) when compared to keeping such animals outside of the house (OR = 1.713; 95% CI 1.515-1.937, P < 0.001). After adjusting for gender, age, access to community health facility, sewage canal condition, use of mosquito nets and insecticide-treated bed nets, the participants who raised medium-sized animals inside their homes were 2.8 times more likely to contract malaria than respondents who did not (adjusted odds ratio = 2.809; 95% CI 2.207-3.575; P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The results of this study highlight the importance of livestock for malaria transmission, suggesting that keeping livestock in the house contributes to malaria risk rather than prophylaxis in Indonesia. Livestock-based interventions should therefore play a significant role in the implementation of malaria control programmes, and focus on households with a high proportion of medium-sized animals in rural areas. The implementation of a "One Health" strategy to eliminate malaria in Indonesia by 2030 is strongly recommended.

TI  - Collective Rural Women Access, Use, and Control Over Communal Land in Mexico: A Post-capitalist Feminist Political Ecology Approach
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Rural women's access to land is fundamental for their individual and household well-being, equity, and empowerment. In Mexico, the agrarian reform of 1992 and customary gendered rights shaped land use, access, and control. Rural women's access to collective land is relevant since social property-ejido and agrarian communities-represents 52% of the national territory. As an expression of the collective organization, commons were also performed to use and control communal land and biophysical resources collectively. This paper examines the collective peasant women's bargaining process to access, use, and control communal land. The post-capitalist feminist political ecology approach allowed us to distinguish and analyze gendered strategies employed by a cooperative led by women at different levels-household, community, and government-to access and use communal land and biophysical resources by the process of commons-commoning. Rural women's collective efforts are located in Hidalgo, central Mexico. Firstly, the Agrarian Reform modifications related to gender equality issues are investigated, followed by examining rural women's socioeconomic conditions. The case study permitted us to identify and analyze critical factors that enhanced long-term agreements to control communal land beyond the Agrarian Law scope by the commoning examination. The collective rural women's strategies to use communal land improved well-being based on gendered peasant knowledge, organization, and stakeholder support. Nevertheless, the strategies increased women's burden and reinforced the existing gendered norms such as female altruism. Furthermore, the need to discuss the bargaining process over communal land concerning a diversity of commons is argued: knowledge, social, and biophysical, in which gender and care are critical variables.

TI  - Drivers of adoption of eucalypt tree farming by smallholders in Thailand
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Eucalypt (Eucalyptus spp.) tree farming is a source of income for many smallholders in developing and emerging countries and critical to the resource supply of many pulp and paper companies. These companies rely on smallholders adopting tree farming, sometimes by offering a contract. This paper reports a study from four regions of Thailand, where smallholder eucalypt tree farming is important, which investigated what characteristics of smallholders were associated with greater adoption of tree farming. A total of 461 eucalypt tree farmers and 171 non-tree farmers were randomly selected and surveyed in these regions, using a door-to-door household survey. A logit analysis corroborated hypotheses about the drivers of adoption. Qualitative analyses were used to inform interpretation of the quantitative results and shed light on the role of eucalypt tree farming in smallholders' livelihood. Results demonstrate that those with suitable land available are more likely to adopt eucalypt tree farming than others. In addition, perception of land tenure security matters in the adoption of tree growing, but holding a formal land tenure document does not. Adoption of eucalypt tree farming in Thailand is not part of a land use intensification strategy. Instead, eucalypts are used as an alternative crop for low productivity land, on which eucalypts are the most profitable crop. Eucalypt tree farming also gives smallholders an opportunity to diversify their income. In addition, this alternative land use has the advantage of requiring low labour inputs between planting and harvest. This is particularly advantageous for many tree growers who have off-farm income or rely on hired labour for farming their land.

TI  - Adoption of rainwater harvesting and its impact on smallholder farmer livelihoods in Kutaber district, South Wollo Zone, Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - This study aimed to identify determinants of rainwater harvesting adoption, and evaluate its impact on livelihood of smallholder farmers in Kutaber district. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed to select 196 sample households. Descriptive statistics and econometric models were used to analyze the primary data. Logit model was used to identify determinants of rainwater harvesting adoption while propensity score matching was used to evaluate its impact on livelihood of smallholder farmers. The result of logit model revealed that education level, family size, farming experience, participation in technology demonstration, and membership in farmer cooperative were significantly and positively affected adoption of rainwater harvesting technology, while age of household head negatively affected it. The finding of this study showed that adoption of rainwater harvesting technology have a positive and significant effect on the livelihood of farmers in terms of household annual farm income and food security. The result indicated that rainwater harvesting has significantly increased adopters' annual farm income by 35.13% and daily calorie intake per adult equivalent by 15.56% than non-adopters. Therefore, it is recommended to alter the attitude of technology averse older farmers, enhance farmer training and experience sharing, accessible demonstration sites and farmer cooperative to achieve extensive adoption of the technology thereby improve farmer's livelihood.

TI  - Risk preferences significantly affect household investment in timber forestry: Empirical evidence from Fujian, China
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Implementing another round of massive collective forest tenure reform in China since in 2008 has not materialized the government's expectation on small-scale timber forestry-improved management practices and resource quality. One underlying cause to this outcome is farmer's risk-averse attitude, which has thus far garnered little research attention. In this study, we combine the prospect theory and a lottery experiment to measure individual risk preferences on timber forestry investment. Based on a sample of 303 households conducted in 2018 in Fujian, China, we find that the 'household risk preference' parameter has a significant negative impact on both the decision to invest in timber forestry and the intensity of investment. Further, the 'loss aversion' and 'probability weighting' parameters affect household investment intensity negatively. These results indicate that the more risk averse rural households are, the less willing they are to invest in timber forestry, and the lower their investment intensities are. Also, the effect of the risk preferences on cash outlay is larger than on labor cost. These insights have direct implications for better designing tenure reform and other policies to promote smallholder forestry in China and beyond.

TI  - Development of a DC Microgrid with Decentralized Production and Storage: From the Lab to Field Deployment in Rural Africa
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - The rural electrification of Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia is crucial to end the energy poverty in which around 1 billion people are trapped. Swarm electrification, i.e., the progressive building of decentralized and decarbonized electric infrastructure in a bottom-up manner, tackles rural electrification challenges by quickly providing modern and reliable electricity services to unelectrified communities while fostering local socio-economic development. This paper follows the technological approach of this electrification model and presents the development of a DC microgrid with decentralized production and storage suitable for rural electrification. This DC microgrid aims at interconnecting nanogrids, small collective autonomous power units composed of a solar panel and a lead-acid battery for 4 to 6 households, to increase the electrical services brought to the community and enhance the economic sustainability of this rural electrification model. The design of the proposed microgrid as well as its control algorithm are thoroughly addressed and tested from software simulations and experimental testing to field deployment in Madagascar. Extensive software, experimental and field-tests results are illustrated, and the microgrid design feedback is given. This paper overall validates the proper operation of the proposed microgrid, confirming the technical feasibility of the swarm electrification approach.

TI  - Evaluating profitability of beef cattle farming and its determinants among smallholder beef cattle farmers in the Baljovan District of Khatlon region, Tajikistan
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - In Tajikistan, owning beef cattle is an important survival mechanism for smallholder farmers to alleviate poverty. Therefore, beef cattle farming enterprises should indeed strive to maximize profit to excel and flourish in a free economy. Nevertheless, smallholder beef cattle farmers are known for making little profit. Thus, this study was set to evaluate the profitability of beef cattle farming and its determinants to enhance profit maximization among smallholder beef cattle farmers in the Baljovan District of Khatlon region, Tajikistan. A total of 388 farming households were chosen at random and purposive for the study. The cross-sectional data collected using questionnaires was analyzed by using descriptive, gross margin (GM), and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models. Based on the descriptive analyses, the mean age of beef cattle farmers was 52.73 years, with a household size of 7.07 members. The beef cattle farmers had an average of 18.23 cattle herd size with 8.54 years of farming experience. The average land area possessed by farmers was 10.59 hectares. Among farmers, men (98.2%) dominated beef cattle farming activities. Around 83.8% of farmers had a college grade (higher literacy). Besides, around 89.4% of farmers had access to farm credits. However, only 71.4% of farmers used farm credit points to produce beef cattle. Most of the farmers (89.7%) had access to accurate market information. Such market information enabled 75.8% of farmers to sell their beef cattle to open market (profitable) outlets rather than middlemen. About 89.4% had access to veterinary services. Additionally, about 82.7% of farmers acknowledged the availability of pasture for grazing, which motivated 87.6% of farmers to be involved in selling contracts. Furthermore, economic investigation results revealed that on average, farmers had a gross margin (GM-profit) of 353.77 US$ per cattle, with feed costs (58.6%) and medications costs (26.1%) accounting for the largest share of total variable costs. Meanwhile, the profitability of beef cattle farming among farmers was significantly influenced by education level, family size, farming experience, pasture availability, land size owned, selling contract, feed costs, medications expenses, access to credits, and sales costs (P < 0.05). This study concluded that beef cattle production is a feasible business. However, the potential for increased profitability is significant if existing resources are efficiently coordinated and production expenses, notably feed and healthcare costs, are minimized. Thus, the government should develop additional measures for addressing concerns such as capacity building, suitable and freely available pasture as well as health management, to boost beef cattle profitability among farmers in Tajikistan.

TI  - The Impact of Farmland Transfers on Agricultural Investment in China: A Perspective of Transaction Cost Economics
T2  - CHINA & WORLD ECONOMY
AB  - There is growing concern that farmland transfers lead to less agricultural investment, which may adversely affect agricultural productivity growth in China. Prior research has primarily focused on the differences between owned cultivated land and rented plots, but little is known about how farmland transfers between relatives, which are popular in rural China, specifically affect agricultural investment. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework of transaction cost economics to compare different contracting strategies in China's farmland rental markets. As farmland rental markets in China are immature, land transfer between relatives establishes bilateral governance, which has the advantage of addressing the opportunistic activities of both parties and can ultimately increase investment by tenants. Based on data from two waves of household surveys, we empirically examine the impact of bilateral governance on the application of organic fertilizer, an indicator for agricultural investment. Our findings show that apart from economic factors, kinship is important to the functioning of farmland rental markets in rural areas.

TI  - Can Cooperative Supports and Adoption of Improved Technologies Help Increase Agricultural Income? Evidence from a Recent Study
T2  - LAND
AB  - Global climate change may result in major environmental issues that have already affected and will continue to affect agricultural sector in the future. A continuing effort to utilize and adopt new agricultural technologies is necessary to mitigate climate change and increase agricultural income. Agricultural cooperatives are gradually being used in emerging countries to encourage improved technology and reduce food insecurity and poverty. This research analyses the influence of cooperative supports (CS) and technology adoption (TA) on agricultural income in Pakistan. It applied the propensity score matching (PSM) technique to evaluate the productivity on survey data from 498 wheat growers to conduct counterfactual analysis for farmers in Pakistan. In addition, a dual selection model (DSM) was applied to resolve the bias in sample selection caused by observed and unobserved aspects of survey data. The results showed that, contrasted with non-membership and non-adopters, growers who joined CS and TA could boost agricultural income by 2.78% and 2.35%, respectively. Stimulatingly, the influence of less-revenue farmers on agricultural income was more substantial than that of high-income farmers. Agricultural income of growers who attached cooperatives and adopted improved agricultural technology enhanced by 5.45% and 4.51%, respectively. These results, among others, emphasize the optimistic role of growing CS and TA in boosting wheat farmer's income. The findings of the study showed strong relationships among education, age, skill, training, gender with CS and TA, and agricultural income. Overall, this study can be helpful in conducting similar studies in other emerging/developing countries for wheat or any other crop growers.

TI  - Privatization in Rural Water Supply and Customer Satisfaction: An Empirical Case Study in Vietnam
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This article investigates the private sector participation in investment, management, and operation in rural water supply schemes in Vietnam. Different organizations manage rural water supply facilities, including the private sector, public sector, and others. This paper aims to compare the different characteristics affecting user satisfaction of water supply facilities managed by the private sector and the remaining sectors. An ordered logit model was utilized for calculation with the data collected from semi-structure questionnaires with 1200 households using water from rural water supply systems managed by different sectors in Vietnam. The results indicate that the water-user satisfaction with rural water supply projects managed by the private sector is higher than that in other sectors (community, cooperative, commune people's committee), whereas there is no significant difference in customer satisfaction between systems managed by the public sector and the private sector (enterprise, private management). The water availability and quality of schemes greatly influence the customer satisfaction. Findings from this study provide considerable information for the private sector on how to improve the management and operation of water supply systems efficiently through customer satisfaction assessment.

TI  - Pigs as a shortcut to money? Social traps in smallholder pig production in northern Uganda
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Recent decades have seen a growing market for pork in Uganda. The government and donors have promoted pig rearing as a potential route out of poverty for poor smallholders. The idea is that upscaling and commercialisation of smallholder pig production can be a successful way out of poverty. Drawing on the concepts of trust and social traps, this article describes how pig production fails as a pathway out of poverty in post-conflict communities in northern Uganda due to tensions created by the focus on individual wealth creation. Results from ethnographic fieldwork reveal that there is a strong moral obligation in the studied communities for individuals who fare better to contribute to the community and share their wealth. Social tensions remaining from the period of conflict are stoked by the focus on individual wealth creation in pig production, resulting in acts of harming, stealing and killing other people???s pigs. Locally these acts are said to be caused by ???jealousy???, which for many smallholders is a more significant problem than disease in pig production. The findings suggest that poverty reduction measures would be more successful if they focused on distributed approaches aimed at raising the general level of welfare in communities and supporting the collective rather than the individual.

TI  - Decisions by Chinese households regarding renting in arable land-The impact of tenure security perceptions and trust
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Policies aimed at strengthening tenure security through the elimination of land reallocations and provision of land certificates have been implemented with different degrees of success in rural China. In this study, we examine the impact of tenure security perceptions and trust on household decisions to rent in land in a region where tenure security is high and in a region where households face much lower land tenure security. Our regression results suggest that when land tenure is less secure, household perceptions of tenure security positively affect decisions to rent in additional land and the size of the rented land, whereas trust is important for the choice between oral and written contracts. When land tenure is relatively secure, household tenure security perceptions are less relevant, and trust becomes more important for land rental decisions. However, tenure security perceptions do seem to play a role in the choice between oral and written contracts in such high tenure security environments.

TI  - Estimation of Women Beedi Workers in India and Their Socio-economic Condition
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF LABOUR ECONOMICS
AB  - Women workers continue in the beedi industry due to the unavailability of alternative livelihoods though they are vulnerable and exploited. This remains a poorly understood field of research due to the unavailability of reliable data, which is an obstacle to the effective implementation of various policies and schemes. Even, the number of beedi worker reported by the Ministry of Labour and Employment contains significant discrepancies. These data show that the registered beedi workers have increased in India with a significant decline in the Southern States in the last two decades. We estimate the women beedi employees at the state and district levels and also assess their socio-economic status. We find that the number of women beedi workers in the registered firms has increased in India including the Southern States, and about 80% of beedi workers are women and mainly living in the rural areas. Further, we find that while West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka have the highest number of beedi workers, the highest share of women in the total beedi workforce is found in Andhra Pradesh (95%), Karnataka (91%), and Tamil Nadu (84%). The majority of women beedi workers are illiterate with a lower wage than men's. The minority mainly Christian followers are significant compared to their population share, and the OBC category is significant among the women beedi workers. More than 90% of the women beedi rollers do not have written job contracts and are not eligible for paid leaves or social security.

TI  - Distress rentals and the land rental market as a safety net: contract choice evidence from Tigray, Ethiopia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Rural households in the semiarid Northern Ethiopian highlands are net buyers of food. Crop failure due to erratic and unpredictable rainfall occurs frequently and leads to food shortages and income shocks. The renting out of land may be one of the coping responses of households exposed to shocks. We developed a theoretical household model for poor landlord households capturing their contract choice response to downside production shocks. We tested econometrically whether contract choice may depend on poverty, capital constraints, production risk and random shocks. The multinomial logit model estimates show that poor households experiencing random shocks are more likely to choose fixed-rent contracts as a distress response to shocks, suggesting that fixed-rent contracts may be used to meet immediate needs, but at the expense of future incomes. We also found that fixed-rent contracts are preferred when ex ante production risk is low, while sharecropping is more likely where production risk is high. Finally, we found an indication that the choice of a fixed-rent contract as a coping response to shocks comes as a last resort after all other means of coping are exhausted.

TI  - Family poultry development systems among smallholder broiler farmers in the Goromonzi district of Zimbabwe
T2  - COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This paper analyzes the dynamics at play in community poultry projects in Zimbabwe. We compare the performance levels of "family poultry" under three community-based development schemes: the contract-based scheme and the two community-led poultry development approaches, one supported by an NGO and the other under self-funding. Factors that influence farmers' choice of the poultry scheme are also determined. Data was collected using observations and self-administered questionnaires from 61 smallholder poultry farmers in the Goromonzi District. Results indicate that landholding and distance to the nearest urban center influence the farmers' choice of poultry scheme and that no single scheme is superior to the other. While the contract-based scheme records the highest sales and bird per cycle, it undermines the community's capabilities to act independently. Contractors control price, marketing, and genetic-type decisions. In contrast, the other approaches have lower material returns, but they build the community's broad-based capabilities for self-improvement.

TI  - Technical efficiency and impact of improved farm inputs adoption on the yield of haricot bean producer in Hadiya zone, SNNP region, Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - Haricot bean is one of the most important food legumes of Ethiopia and it is considered as the main cash crop and the least expensive source of protein for the farmers. Low production and productivity, which are mainly associated with poor adoption and inefficient implementation of improved farm technologies, were among the major problems. Adoption and efficient utilization of improved farm inputs is one of the most promising ways to reduce food insecurity in study area. However, the adoption and implementation of these improved farm inputs is constrained by various factors. So, the aim of this study was to analyze the technical efficiency and impact of improved farm inputs adoption on the yield of haricot bean producers. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed to select 231 sample household heads and they were interviewed using structured interview schedule. Data analysis was done with the help of Stochastic Frontier Analysis; mainly Cobb-Douglas Production Function, logistic regression model were employed. The Stochastic Production Frontier result revealed that the allocated amount of land, labour, seed, chemical fertilizer and oxen were appeared to be positively and significantly influencing haricot bean production of both adopters and total sampled householders. The result of logistic regression model indicated that the probability of adoption of improved farm inputs affected by extension service, information access and cooperative membership positively and by market distance and crop diversification negatively. Therefore, specialization, asset formation, innovative institutional arrangement, information, extension and farmers training accompanied with more access to chemical fertilizer in the study area.

TI  - Rural credit cooperatives' contribution to agricultural growth: evidence from China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW
AB  - Purpose Rural credit cooperatives (RCCs) have long dominated China's rural credit market and met most of agricultural credit demands while the existing literature seldom examines their contribution to agricultural sector. The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical evidence on the contribution of RCCs to agricultural growth, using China's provincial panel data from 1997 to 2014. Design/methodology/approach Both static fixed effects models and two-step generalized method of moment dynamic panel data models, which control the endogeneity, are employed to identify the causality from RCC credit to agricultural growth in China. Findings The results show that the credit from RCCs increases the agricultural output significantly. A 1 percent increase in RCC credit leads to agricultural growth of about 0.08 percent, which is robust to various empirical specifications. Further study shows that the contribution of RCC credit to agricultural growth decreases from the most developed eastern region to the least developed western region and increases over time. Research limitations/implications The results imply that RCC credit is critical in financing agricultural activities by relaxing rural credit constraints and intense competition strengthens the contribution of RCCs to agricultural growth by improving managerial efficiency and developing diversified financial products to meet better rural credit demands. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this is first empirical study on the effect of RCC credit on agricultural growth despite of many on the role of financial development in agricultural growth.

TI  - Does the transfer of farmland use rights increase farmers' long-term intention to work in cities?
T2  - ECONOMICS OF TRANSITION AND INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE
AB  - This study investigates how the transfer of rural land contract management rights in China has influenced the choice of rural workers to work in cities in the long run. Using data from the Rural Household Survey and Migrant Household Survey from the China Household Income Project in 2007, 2008 and 2013, we find that rural land transfers and the subsequent human capital effect are found to play important roles in farmers' decision to give up agricultural work and relocate to work in urban areas. Our findings indicate that the Chinese government should accelerate the implementation of policies that promote the separation of ownership rights, contracting rights and management rights of contracted land and continuously improve the rural land property rights system.

TI  - Experiments in farmers' collectives in Eastern India and Nepal: Process, benefits, and challenges
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE
AB  - Do farmers' collectives, which pool land, labour, capital, and skills to create medium-sized production units, offer a more viable model of farming for resource-constrained smallholders than individual family farms? A participatory action research project in Eastern India and Nepal provides notable answers. Groups of marginal and tenant farmers, catalysed by the project, evolved into four different collective models with varying levels of cooperation, gender composition, and land ownership/tenancy status. Based on 3 years of action research, this paper examines how the models evolved and their differential outcomes. All groups have gained from cultivating contiguous plots in their efficiency of labour and machine use for land preparation and irrigation, and from economies in input purchase. Several collectives of tenant farmers have also enhanced their bargaining power vis-a-vis an entrenched landlord class and thus been able to negotiate lower rents and refuse long-standing feudal obligations. However, the models differ in their extent of economic gain and their ability to handle gender inequalities and conflicts over labour sharing. The paper explores the historical, regional, and cultural factors that could explain such differences across the models. It thus offers unique insights into the processes, benefits, and challenges of farmers' collectives and provides pointers for replication and further research.

TI  - Women's land activism and gendered citizenship in the urbanising Pearl River Delta
T2  - URBAN STUDIES
AB  - In light of the unequal access to urban citizenship resulting from the household registration system (hukou), an increasing number of scholarly works have pointed out how a system of citizenship stratification has emerged in urbanising China. However, this stratification has seldom been analysed in terms of gender. Rural women, situated at the bottom of the hierarchy of differentiated citizenship, often suffer gender-based discrimination and tumble still further down the hierarchy. Specifically, women are vulnerable to economic and social dispossession in the process of the displacement of rural populations and renegotiation of land rights. Owing to the custom of patrilocal residence, women who have 'married out' (waijianu) have been excluded from rights, participation and entitlement to collective land property. By creating a class of rural female non-citizens, rural communities have deprived waijianu of opportunities to share land-related revenue realised in the process of urbanisation, further perpetuating male dominance just as local economies and society are in flux. Through a case study of these conflicts in Guangdong, this paper explores how women have challenged gendered citizenship in the process of urbanisation.

TI  - Reclaiming our Land and Labour: Women's Resistance to Extractivist Agriculture in Southeastern Ghana
T2  - FEMINIST AFRICA
AB  - Neoliberal development projects have invaded multiple spaces. In rural areas, women's livelihood activities are targets for interventions in the name of poverty reduction and this is often conveyed through commercial agricultural production schemes. These initiatives have become the source of tension between household-based production and capitalist production systems. This qualitative research uses the establishment of an industrial cassava company in south-eastern Ghana to reflect on some of the lingering questions of commercial agricultural production. This was done by examining its features, its implications for livelihoods, and women's resistance strategies to the extractivist production system. Women combined evasive and confrontational resistance strategies based on class-including demands for new land, land occupation, labour withdrawal from household farms and the company, and absenteeism from work-to reclaim their land and labour. The women's politics had wider ramifications for the new production systems, causing the company to change its production model as a response to the many concerns of the women and other social groups. The strategies largely contributed to rescuing the local economy from extractive agricultural production. The women were united in their individual and collective struggles against a system which they soon realised threatened their livelihoods. In this study, I argue that women's responses to the changes in their agrarian landscape, although differentiated on the basis of class, should ultimately be seen as questioning the neoliberal development vehicle that encroaches on autonomous production and gives less than it takes.

TI  - Factors that vulnerate potato (Solanum tuberosum) farming household sustainability in Narino, Colombia, based on their livelihood assets
T2  - REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE LA PAPA
AB  - Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is one of the most widespread crops in the Narino area, in Colombia, and constitutes a significant asset set in the livelihood strategy adopted by the farming households. However, the challenges faced by this crop may limit the household's assets base, making them vulnerable. This research provides a livelihood study that follows the approach proposed by the Department for International Development (DFID). Considering this conceptual framework, quantitative data were obtained through 769 surveys implemented to potato-farming households (previously classified as micro, small and medium producers), from 21 municipalities in Narino. The results indicate that 1. The population is potato crop dependent, 2. The assets examined differ among micro, small and medium producers, 3. Cultural and traditional aspects such as community and collective work in the minga (Ayni) or seed exchange are in decline and 4. Socioeconomic and agroecological assets diversity is limited. From this analysis, it is possible to conclude that urgent and timely shock measures should be implemented (for example: market price regulation strategies and social inclusion programs focused on poverty), to avoid that the potato production loses viability as a livelihood strategy for the inhabitants of this region.

TI  - How forestland size affects household profits from timber harvests: A case study in China's Southern collective forest area
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - To improve the economies of scale in forest management and reduce the fragmentation of forestland, the Chinese central government has implemented a collective forest tenure supplementary reform since 2008. This has included a series of policies for motivating transfer of forestlands use rights among households in the country's Southern Collective Forest Area (SCFA). However, to date there is little evidence that large-scale forest owners can earn more profits from timber harvests than small-scale forest owners in the SCFA. Using data collected from household surveys in the three of the SCFA's provinces in 2016, this paper examines the return to scale of forestland ownership for timber harvests in this region, and how the scale of forestland ownership affects households' profits from timber harvests. The results show a constant return to scale in timber harvests in the case provinces in China's SCFA, that forestland area makes the most important contribution to the output of timber harvests, and that fragmentation of forestland results in lower profits from timber harvests. It appears that a moderate scale of forestland ownership should be identified for increasing the profits from timber harvests. With the rapid urbanization throughout China, an increase in off-farm employment among rural household members has a negative impact on timber harvests in the region. We argue that policymakers should realize the importance of encouraging the forestland transfers and improve the concentration of forestlands in the next stage of forest tenure rights reform in China's SCFA.

TI  - Farmers' willingness to accept payments for ecosystem services on agricultural land: The case of climate-smart agroforestry in Ethiopia
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB  - This study examines smallholder farmers' preferences for the uptake of contractual climate-smart agroforestry, which yields economic and ecosystem benefits. A discrete choice experiment was conducted with smallholder farmers in Ethiopia to elicit their willingness to participate in a payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme that incentivizes integrating faidherbia albida (a fertilizer tree) in their mono-cropping farming system. Attributes evaluated are "number of planted trees", "payment amount", "payment type", and "contract period". The presence of heterogeneity in the choice behavior of farmers warrants the use of the generalized multinomial logit and latent class conditional logit models to allow for farmer-and class-specific preferences, respectively. The results show that farmers derive higher utility from up-front payments. Farmers also strongly prefer food as the mode of payment than cash. Moreover, low numbers of mandatory planted trees and short-term contracts are found to be essential attributes that positively affect farmers' decisions to take-up a contractual arrangement to grow trees on their agricultural land. Our analysis also shows the presence of heterogeneity in preferences across segments of farmers in conjunction with differences in household characteristics. These findings shed light on the considerations that must be accounted for when designing and implementing environmental policies such as PES schemes that promote large-scale adoption of climate-smart agroforestry, which would transform smallholder agriculture into a sustainable farming system.

TI  - Can an innovation platform support a local process of climate-smart agriculture implementation? A case study in Cauca, Colombia
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - The main purpose of this work was analyzing how an innovation platform can foster and provide a basis for multi-actor collaboration in order to enable climate-smart agriculture (CSA) implementation at the local level. Using a mix of social (interactions between stakeholders, knowledge changes, adoption of practices) and technical indicators (income, fulfillment of caloric requirements of the household, farm resource use, planned biodiversity or greenhouse gas emission changes), we monitored the collaboration between an NGO, local civil authorities, associations, and farmers that aimed to achieve a common goal linked to the participatory and contextualized development of CSA in Colombia. We found that multiple stakeholder engagements led to improved interactions between members of the platform and their local environment, a proactive participation in the platform meetings and a significant increase in farmer knowledge levels on the challenges posed by climate change and the resultant extreme events. The platform also facilitated the adoption of best-bet practices that contribute towards CSA when farmers both diversify their production and decrease the use of mineral fertilizers. Our findings suggest that innovation platforms can facilitate the collective understanding and use of CSA options corresponding to local conditions and priorities.

TI  - Working with teams of "insiders": Qualitative approaches to data collection in the Global South
T2  - DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH
AB  - BACKGROUND
   The convergence of two qualitative methodological strategies - working in "teams" and with "insiders" - can facilitate access, efficiency, and insights into research questions of interest to demographers. Even though this approach is becoming more common among population researchers in the Global South to address a range of research questions, little has been published that describes the method and critically assesses its strengths and weaknesses.
   OBJECTIVE
   We draw on three projects embedded in the Agincourt Health and Socio-Demographic Surveillance System site in rural South Africa that integrate both approaches to demonstrate the benefits and limitations of this strategy.
   METHOD
   We document, through in-depth description, how these three projects achieve access, efficiency, and insights into issues of population concern (HIV/AIDS, aging, and child wellbeing) utilizing a "team-insider" approach by working with groups of local research assistants.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The projects vary in their use of "teams" and "insiders" but collectively deepen our understanding of pressing population concerns in the Global South. In particular, by using teams of insiders, these projects gain insights into local ideas about HIV, uncover ways that HIV affects older women's lives, and provide in-depth understanding of children's social connections. The approach also presents a number of challenges, however, such as grappling with the responsibilities and burdens that are placed on local insider team members.

TI  - Financial protection effects of modification of China's New Cooperative Medical Scheme on rural households with chronic diseases
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Several years have passed since the rural New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) in China was established and policies kept continuous improvement. Its policies on chronic diseases vary by county but have certain shared characteristics. Following this modification of medical insurance policy, this study reassesses the provision of insurance against expenditure on chronic diseases in rural areas, and analyzes its effect on impoverishment.
   Methods: We conducted an empirical study using multi-stage stratified random sampling. We surveyed 1,661 rural households in three provinces and analyzed the responses from 1,525 households that participated in NCMS, using descriptive and logistic regression analysis.
   Results: The NCMS has reduced the prevalence of poverty and catastrophic health expenditure (CHE), as measured by out-of-pocket (OOP) payments exceeding 40% of total household expenditure, by decreasing medical expenditure. It provides obvious protection to households which include someone with chronic diseases. However, these households continue to face a higher financial risk than those without anyone suffering from chronic diseases. Variables about health service utilization and OOP payment differed significantly between households with or without people suffering from chronic disease. And CHE risk is commonly associated with household income, the number of family members with chronic diseases, OOP payment of outpatient and inpatient service in all three provinces.
   Conclusion: To reduce CHE risk for these households, it is critical to decrease OOP payments for health services by enhancing the effective reimbursement level of NCMS and strictly regulating the providers' behaviors. We recommend that a combinatory changes should be made to the rural health insurance scheme in China to improve its effect. These include improving the NCMS benefit package by broadening the catalogue of drugs and treatments covered, decreasing or abolishing deductible and increasing the reimbursement ratio of outpatient services for people with chronic diseases, together with expansion of insurance fund, and modifying health providers' behaviors by payment reform.

TI  - Rural land use transition of mountainous areas and policy implications for land consolidation in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
AB  - The cultivation of mountainous land results in water loss and soil erosion. With rapid urbanization and industrialization in China, labor emigration relieves the cultivation of mountainous areas in regions with high poverty and leads to a significant land use transition. This research built an analysis framework for "land use transition - driving mechanism - effects - responses" for mountainous areas of China undergoing land use transition and then proposed the direction of mountainous land consolidation. The results showed that the turning point of land use morphology was the core of rural land use transition in mountainous areas. The expansion of cropland and the contraction of forestland have transitioned to the abandonment of cropland and the expansion of forestland; this transition was the main characteristic of the dominant land use change. Land marginalization and land ecological functional recovery were the main characteristics of the recessive land use transition in mountainous areas. Socioeconomic factors were the primary driving forces during land use transition in mountainous areas, with labor emigration being the most direct force. The rising costs of farming and the challenging living conditions causing labor emigration were fundamental driving forces. Rural land use transition in mountainous areas reduced the vulnerability of the ecological function of land ecosystems. The advantages and disadvantages of the socioeconomic effects should focus on rural development of mountainous areas as well as the livelihood of farmers; this should be further supported by empirical and quantitative research. Rural land use transition of mountainous areas improves natural restoration and is related to socioeconomic development. Rural land consolidation of mountainous areas should conform to land use transition, with the goal of shifting from the increase of cultivated land to the synergies of ecological and environmental protection.

TI  - Contract farming, contract design and smallholder livelihoods*
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - Contract farming has gained in importance in many developing countries. Previous studies analysed effects of contracts on smallholder farmers' welfare, yet mostly without considering that different types of contractual relationships exist. Here, we examine associations between contract farming and farm household income in the oil palm sector of Ghana, explicitly differentiating between two types of contracts, namely simple marketing contracts and more comprehensive resource-providing contracts. Moreover, we look at different income sources to better understand how both contracts are linked to farmers' livelihood strategies. We use cross-sectional survey data and regression models. Issues of endogeneity are addressed through measuring farmers' willingness-to-participate in contracts and using this indicator as an additional covariate. Farmers with both types of contracts have significantly higher household incomes than farmers without a contract, yet with notable differences in terms of the income sources. Farmers with a marketing contract allocate more household labour to off-farm activities and thus have higher off-farm income. In contrast, farmers with a resource-providing contract have larger oil palm plantations and thus higher farm incomes. The findings suggest that the two contract types are associated with different livelihood strategies and that disaggregated analysis of different income sources is important to better understand possible underlying mechanisms.

AB  - This paper studies the long-term health and economic consequences of China's Household Responsibility System (HRS) reform-a property reform that assigned collectively owned farmland to individual households with secure tenures and boosted labor productivity among rural populations. Using regional variation in reform timing and pace, I provide evidence that early-life exposure to HRS improved individuals' later-life health, education, and labor market outcomes. However, exposure to HRS at critical school ages reduced human capital investment in children, making them less likely to receive education and more likely to remain in agriculture.

TI  - The effect of contract farming on the environmentally sustainable production of rice in China
T2  - SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB  - Environmentally sustainable production has been widely discussed as one of the most important issues in sustainable agricultural development, especially for countries with limited arable land resources. In this study, we estimate the effect of contract farming on environmentally sustainable production behaviours using a household survey of 623 farmers in China conducted in 2019. To address selection bias and the potential endogeneity problem of contract farming participation, the propensity score matching approach and endogenous switching regression are employed in estimations of rice farmers' environmentally sustainable production behaviours. The results indicate that participation in contract farming can increase the probability of applying environmentally sustainable control technologies and manual weeding by 56.7% and 28.2%, respectively. It is also found that organic fertiliser use can be increased by 31.1% when farmers participate in contract farming. Thus, we conclude that contract farming promotes environmentally sustainable production and could potentially protect the environment from the abuse of inorganic fertilisers and pesticides in agricultural production. While contract farming tends to increase the total cost of rice production, the benefits of increasing the sale price and farmers' gross and net incomes from contract farming serve as the main channels underlying the positive effect of contract farming on environmentally sustainable production.

TI  - Drivers of Farm-level Adoption of Crop Extension Packages in Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Smallholder farmers' adoption of agricultural technologies varies to a great degree with respect to spatial diversity, household related characteristics, access to infrastructure and institutional design. This cross-sectional study was conducted in order to understand the factors affecting the uptake agricultural technologies in the highlands of Ethiopia. Analysis was conducted on data collected in 2014 from a survey of 2,880 households in four major regions of the country covering 30 districts. Econometric method (two-limit Tobit model) was used to analyse determinants of farm-level adoption of crop technology packages promoted by the national agricultural extension service. Findings reveal that 71%, 66%, 60%, 52%, 46% and 29% of the sample households adopted recommended technology packages for potato, wheat, maize, tef, barley, and sorghum respectively. Results demonstrate that agro-ecology and spatial variability, distance from homestead to farm plots, slope index of the farm, access to extension services, access to credit, lagged gross annual income and membership to a cooperatives were all significant factors influencing technology adoption. The study shows there is significant variation in technology adoption between model farmers and non-model farmers. However, the productivity difference is limited to few crops. The findings suggest that investment in infrastructure, promoting access to institutional services and access to credit are instrumental to technology adoption by smallholders. The extension strategy should therefore promote inclusive strategy in which both model and non-model farmers have equal access to technology supply and extension services.

TI  - An evaluation of China's new rural cooperative medical system: achievements and inadequacies from policy goals
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Although much public scrutiny and academic attention has focused on the evaluations of system implementation since the beginning of New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NRCMS) in China, few studies have systematically evaluated the achievements of the stated policy goals. The purpose of this study is to examine to what extent the policy goals of NRCMS have been achieved.
   Methods: Using multistage sampling processes, two rounds of cross-sectional household surveys including 9787 and 7921 rural households were conducted in Eastern China in year 2000 and year 2008, respectively. A pre- and post-implementation comparison was used to evaluate the achievement of policy goals in three measures: impoverishment from major health hazards, household financial risk from medical expenses, and rural income inequity. Intention surveys were also applied to find out potential obstacles in the implementation of NRCMS.
   Results: The rate of re-impoverishment from health hazard was reduced from 2.69 % ex ante to 2.12 % ex post, a decrease of 21.13 %. The severity of impoverishment fell from a previous 4.66 % to 3.02 %, a decline of 35.18 %. Economic risk of medical treatment population relative to the whole population fell from 2.62 ex ante to 2.03 ex post, a 22.52 % reduction. As indication of effect on improving income equity, the Gini coefficient fell from 0.4629 to 0.4541. The effects of NRCMS were significantly better than those of RCMS. Despite the preliminary achievements, our intention survey of key respondents identified that technical difficulties in actuarial funding and more sustainable reimbursement schedules has become the most challenging barriers in achieving the goals of NRCMS, while raising the insurance premium on NRCMS was no longer as big a barrier.
   Conclusions: With NRCMS, China has established a medical security system to reduce the financial burden of healthcare on rural residents. NRCMS has achieved some positive though limited effects; but technical difficulties in the implementation of NRCMS have become barriers to achieve the pre-set policy goals. Efforts should be made to improve the capacity building in the design of the reimbursement schemes for the implementers of NRCMS, such as identifying medical impoverishment, calculating actuarial funding levels for the risk pooling.

TI  - Collective Action and Community Development: Evidence from Self-Help Groups in Rural India
T2  - WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - In response to the problems of high coordination costs among the poor, efforts are underway in many countries to organize the poor through "self-help groups" (SHGs)-membership-based organizations that aim to promote social cohesion through a mixture of education, access to finance, and linkages to wider development programs. We randomly selected villages in one of the poorest districts in rural India in which to establish SHGs for women. Two years of exposure to these programs increased women's participation in group savings programs as well as the non-agricultural labor force. Compared to women in control villages, treated women were also more likely to participate in household decisions and engage in civic activities. We find no evidence however, that participation increased income or had a disproportionate impact on women's socio-economic status. These results are important in light of the recent effort to expand official support to SHGs under India's National Rural Livelihood Mission.

TI  - Risk aversion in crop insurance program purchase decisions Evidence from maize production areas in China
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the aforementioned literature on the linkage between economic activity and human preference by estimating the cross-sectional determinants of farmers' participation in participation in crop insurance programs (CIPs) and identifying the impediments preventing the remaining farmers from participating.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using the unique data sets of risk preference experiments and maize producer surveys pertaining to the maize production areas of China, this paper explores the determinants of farmers' CIPs and scrutinizes the role of risk aversion in farmers' CIP purchase decisions under the expected utility maximization framework. And a "non-zero threshold probit model" is used for the analysis.
   Findings - The results show that risk aversion plays an important role in CIP purchase decision-making, not only in the form of its direct effect but also with regard to the interaction term and expected loss. Furthermore, if the insured amount is high enough, then risk aversion will no longer affect insurance purchase. Additionally, purchase experience, CIP environment (village purchase ratio), and contract items (insured amounts) are significant determinates in these decisions. There is no significant evidence to suggest that serious adverse selection exists in the sampling areas.
   Originality/value - One theoretical model is established which considered not only general variables like farmers' production and household information, but also conditions and terms in the insurance policies. The unique experimental method is used to measure farmers' risk aversion. Both the role of risk aversion and its' interaction terms with others in CIP participation are scrutinized to identify complicated influences under the context of real society.

TI  - Assessment of household risk management strategies for coastal aquaculture: the case of clam farming in Thaibinh Province, Vietnam
T2  - AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Clam farmers have experienced different types of risks that have been further exacerbated by the rapid expansion of clam farming areas, increased growing densities, and increased market difficulties in recent years in the Thaibinh Province of Vietnam. Most farmers have been seriously affected by production risk, market risk, and financial risk, while a number of others have met with success in almost all of their clam-raising cycles. This study applied a differentiating comparative analysis method and multiple discriminant analysis method to discuss the differences in risk management strategies between and among clam farming households and the impacts of those differences on their success/failure rates. In general, the tactics are related to increase in farm size, the application of technical innovations, diversifying livelihood activities, and accessing secure financial sources all provided better conditions for clam growth, diminished losses, and led to speedier recovery from shocks. To support farmers in managing risks, several government interventions are needed: (1) better re-zoning of clam farming areas in parallel with an increase in the farm size of each household, (2) promoting sustainable linkages between the farmers and the formal financial market and output market, and (3) investing more funding into research and extension related to sustainable clam farming practices and to the improvement of farmers' skills in cooperative works and management.

TI  - Social and environmental impacts of agricultural cooperatives: evidence from Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB  - Cooperatives are considered as potential organizational vehicles for sustainable development due to their multiple objectives and diverse roles. In particular, a lot is expected from agricultural cooperatives since they depend mainly on natural resource-based activities where sustainability issues are central concerns. Using household survey data of 305 coffee farmers from Ethiopia, the impacts of cooperative membership on farmers' social and environmental performances are examined. Findings, based on propensity scores matching, show a significant positive impact of cooperatives on members' social capital including trust, commitment and satisfaction, and on human capital such as training sessions received and experiences gained. However, farmers' environmental performance is negatively associated with membership contrary to expectations. The findings suggest further efforts that need to be made by agricultural cooperatives to improve the environmental performance of farmers, while the accumulated human and social capitals are encouraging and can ease future collective actions toward cares for the environment and future generations.

TI  - Remittance inflow and smallholder farming practices. The case of Moldova
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - In the Republic of Moldova, a large number of households that received land shares after the break-down of the collective farm structure currently focus on semi-subsistence agriculture. Often, one or more members of these households have migrated abroad. This paper aims at assessing the impact of remittances on their agricultural production practices and investments. The authors rely on the rotating panel dataset of the Household Budget Survey for the period 2007-2013, and on an original survey carried out on a sample of 126 households in 2015. To test if remittance recipients replace family labour and self-produced inputs with mechanisation services and purchased inputs, a shadow agricultural wage is estimated. Logistic regressions are used to assess whether the occurrence of investments (farmland, machinery, or dairy cattle) is more probable in the case of remittance inflow. The results show that recipient households reduce their drudgery by substituting family labour and self produced seeds and feed with mechanisation services and purchased inputs, without necessarily increasing production efficiency. The relationship between remittances and agricultural investments is very weak or negative. However, qualitative insights demonstrate that many investments (greenhouses, rototillers, walnut orchards, etc.) were possible thanks to remittances. Although most recipients do not invest in agriculture, the minority that does invest has access to remittances.

TI  - Losses because of risk attitudes or time preference: off-farm cold storage and intertemporal marketing of apple growers in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to explore the relationship between prudence in risk attitudes and patience of time preference of Chinese apple growers regarding off-farm cold storage of production and marketing in non-harvest seasons. The authors also consider the effect of farmer participation in cooperative-like organizations known as Farm Bases (FBs). Design/methodology/approach The authors use multiple list methods and elicitation strategies to measure Chinese apple farmers' risk attitudes and time preferences. Because these farmers can either sell their apples immediately to supermarkets or intermediaries or place them in storage, the authors assess correlations between their storage decisions and their preferences regarding risk and time. The authors also differentiate risks involving gains and losses and empirically examine individual risk attitudes in different scenarios. Findings Marketing decisions are moderately associated with risk attitudes but not time preference. Farmers with memberships in local farmer cooperatives are likely to speculate more in cold storage. Thus, risk aversion behavioral and psychological motives affect farmers' decision-making of cold storage and intertemporal marketing activities. However, membership in cooperatives does not always result in improved income and welfare for farmers. Research limitations/implications The research confirms that behavioral factors may strongly drive vulnerable smallholder farmers to speculate into storage even under seasonal and uncertain marketing volatility. There is the need to think deeper about the rationale of promoting cooperatives and other agricultural forms, because imposing these without careful consideration can have negative impacts. Originality/value Do risk and time preferences affect the decision of farmers to utilize storage facilities? This question is important because it is not clear if and how risk preferences affect the tradeoff between consuming today and saving for tomorrow, especially for farmers in developing countries.

TI  - Effects of social capital on farmers' choices of climate change adaptation behavior in Dazu District, China
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study explores the effects of social capital on farmers' choices of climate change adaptation behavior in Dazu District, China. A total of 228 questionnaires were obtained from randomly sampled households. Social capital was divided into social networks, participation, reciprocity and trust. The adaptation behaviors in the study area were identified as crop adjustment, environmental improvement, financial management, and livelihood diversification. A boosted regression tree model was used to analyze the effects of different dimensions of social capital on farmers' choices of climate change adaptation behavior. The results show that most farmers in Dazu District of Chongqing have adopted crop adjustment adaptation behavior. The social capital and socioeconomic characteristics of farmers have different impacts on different adaptation behaviors. Among social capital, the largest influence on climate change adaptation behavior is the degree of trust in the information of agricultural technology extension service centers, and the lowest influence is participation in rural cooperatives. In terms of socioeconomic characteristics, the largest impact on climate change adaptation behavior is agricultural income share, and the lowest impact is gender. The findings of this study can provide empirical support for governments to formulate effective policies to improve farmers' climate change adaptation capabilities.

TI  - Study design and rationale for a cluster randomized trial of a safe child feces management intervention in rural Odisha, India
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background Poor child feces management (CFM) is believed to be an important source of exposure to enteric pathogens that contribute to a large disease burden in low-income settings. While access to sanitation facilities is improving, national surveys indicate that even households with latrines often do not safely dispose of their child's feces. Working with caregivers in rural Odisha, India, we co-developed an intervention aimed at improving safe disposal of child feces and encouraging child latrine use at an earlier age. We describe the rationale for the intervention and summarize the protocol for a cluster randomized trial (CRT) to evaluate its effectiveness at changing CFM practices. Methods The intervention consists of six behavior change strategies together with hardware provision: wash basin and bucket with lid to aid safe management of soiled nappies and a novel latrine training mat to aid safe disposal and latrine training. The intervention will be offered at the village level to interested caregivers of children < 5 years of age by a community-based organization. Following a baseline survey, 74 villages were randomly allocated to either intervention or control arm. The primary outcome is caregiver reported safe disposal of child feces after last defecation, either by the caregiver disposing of the child's feces into the latrine or the child using the latrine, measured approximately four to six months following intervention delivery. Secondary outcomes include fecal contamination of household drinking water and the childs' hands. A process evaluation will also be conducted to assess intervention fidelity and reach, and explore implementer and participant feedback. Discussion This study addresses a crucial knowledge gap in sanitation by developing a scalable intervention to improve safe management of child feces. The behavior change strategies were designed following the Risks, Attitudes, Norms, Abilities and Self-Regulation (RANAS) approach, which has shown to be effective for other environmental behavior change interventions in low-income settings. The latrine training mat hardware is a novel design developed cooperatively and manufactured locally. The evaluation follows a rigorous CRT study design assessing the impact of the intervention on CFM behavior change, as well as fecal contamination of two sources of potential exposure.

TI  - Human capital and the agrarian structure in transition: Micro-evidence from Romania
T2  - ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY
CP  - 25th IAAE Conference 2003
AB  - This article examines determinants of the agrarian structure in transition economies with an emphasis on the role of rural households' human capital. Land reform and enterprise restructuring have resulted in a broad range of farm types, such as cooperatives, partnerships, individual farms and combinations of these. In the theoretical model the fact that household resources are allocated to different organization modes is attributed to the utility maximization strategy of heterogeneous agents deriving income from uncertain sources in the face of incomplete factor markets. The empirical results from a multinomial logit model estimated with data from a two-year nationwide survey of Romanian rural households support the hypothesis that the current agrarian structure is importantly affected by the human capital characteristics of the households and the economic risks they face.

TI  - Community Organized Household Water Increases Not Only Rural incomes, but Also Men's Work
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This paper explores community-organized, household water supply in seven communities in western Kenya. We compare water use, labor use, income and the conditions for collective action in three sets of communities: two have protected springs and piped homestead connections; two have protected springs but no homestead connection; and three draw potentially contaminated water from unprotected springs.
   We find that piped water reduces the work of women and girls, and facilitates home garden and livestock production. Together these changes lead to increased household incomes. Women recognize clear time-benefits. Men, however, experience extra work. No overall pattern emerges regarding the preconditions for collective action. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Management of tree diversity in agricultural landscapes around Mabira Forest Reserve, Uganda
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - As natural forests contract. farming systems become increasingly important to landscape biodiversity conservation. yet assets and limits of their contribution are insufficiently documented. A sound understanding of farmer strategies in the management of on-farm tree biodiversity is also critical to landscape approaches for biodiversity conservation and livelihood improvement. Diversity and management of woody species were surveyed in 105 farms around Mabira Forest in South-Central Uganda. Farms were selected according to distance to forest, landscape axis. gender. wealth. and specialized forest use of household heads. Farmer management has a strong influence on tree diversity in the coffee-banana systems around Mabira Forest. This is reflected in the relatively high number of planted and exotic species at the levels of farm niche, farm and landscape. Both the number of years under cultivation and farmer involvement in specialized forest use were conducive to higher species diversity. Gender. wealth and tenure status did not influence tree diversity. Variation in on-farm species richness was noted between landscape axes radiating out of the forest rather than concentric distance categories. Farming systems around Mabira Forest Reserve provide a key complementary rather than substitute tree diversity refuge and can be managed to enhance overall landscape biodiversity.

TI  - Are China's Farms Growing?
T2  - CHINA & WORLD ECONOMY
AB  - China's agricultural sector faces challenges because most farms are still small scale. China's policy is to encourage the consolidation of farms and promote farms that are larger in scale. A question that arises is: Are China's farms growing? The goal of the present paper is to determine whether large farms in China have emerged or if farms remain small. To meet this goal, we systematically document the trends in the operational sizes of China 's farms and measure the determinants of changes in farm size. Using a nationally representative dataset, the study shows that in 2013 China 's farming sector was still mostly characterized by small-scale farms. However, at the same time, there is an emerging class of middle-sized and larger-sized farms. Most large farms are being run by households but there is a set of large farms that are company/cooperative-run. Today, farmers on larger farms are younger and better educated than the average farmer.

TI  - Farmers' Perception and Drivers of Membership in Rice Production Community Enterprises: Evidence from the Central Region, Thailand
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In rapidly developing economies such as Thailand, farmers face multiple challenges preventing them from improving their livelihoods, and are therefore reverting to collective action as a means to overcome those obstacles. Community enterprises (CEs) have recently emerged as a new form of such collective action, yet there is limited evidence regarding farmers' perception of rice production CEs (RPCEs) and the specific factors influencing their decision to join. In order to fill this gap, primary data were collected through questionnaires administered to 406 farmers in six districts in Uthai Thani province in the central region of Thailand. A weighted average index (WAI) was employed to assess the farmers' perception of RPCEs' role, and a binary logit regression model was used to investigate the determinants of perception and membership in RPCEs. The results revealed that both members and non-members perceived RPCEs as a saving source but not a credit provider. Compared to non-members, members put more emphasis on the product competition with rivals. Decision to join was associated with small landholdings, diversity of rice varieties cultivated, participation in networks, membership of economic groups, access to extension services, access to credit, and proximity to the market. The results suggest that production-oriented and marketing-oriented policies should be promoted in order to encourage farmers to cultivate organic rice and rice for the niche market to supply to RPCEs in order to generate greater group income.

TI  - Understanding How People Make Decision about Preventive Behavior against COVID-19: A Case from Rural Areas in Western Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is the most significant health challenge humans experienced since World War 2, and its course can be affected by the stringency in undertaking individual and collective protective behavior. In this study, the health belief model structures in adopting the protective behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed. A sample of 375 household heads living in the rural areas of Lorestan Province was selected through a multi-stage stratified and random sampling method. Structural equation modeling showed that knowledge, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, self-efficacy, and cues to action affect the protective behaviors of Iranian rural households during COVID-19. Cues to action and knowledge were the most important predictors of protective behaviors in rural households. The results suggest the necessity to emphasize enhancing knowledge to highlight the negative impacts of COVID-19 and train rural households regarding the proper and effective preventive measures.

TI  - Smallholders and the 'Household responsibility system': Adapting to institutional change in Chinese agriculture
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
AB  - During the last quarter century, China's agricultural sector has undergone a dramatic transformation from collective to private production under the so-called "Household Responsibility System." This incentive system, designed to increase yields, reallocated communal land to peasant households, creating hundreds of millions of smallholders with relative autonomy over land use decisions and crop selection. Based on recent ethnographic research, this paper discusses the smallholder farming system of a mixed-ethnic community that intensively cultivates small land plots for subsistence and market exchange in China's populous southwestern province of Sichuan. The paper characterizes the smallholder system in terms of biodiversity of plant and animal species, market distribution of crops, multiple cropping systems, and labor and technology inputs. The paper also describes how smallholders adapt their agricultural practices and decisions to changing market conditions and agricultural policies. Significantly, these adaptive strategies focus on shifting to the production of various cash crops, including melons and mangoes. Implications for the long-term viability of China's smallholders, particularly in ecologically and economically marginal areas, are also discussed.

TI  - Degree of Abandoned Cropland and Socioeconomic Impact Factors in China: Multi-Level Analysis Model Based on the Farmer and District/County Levels
T2  - LAND
AB  - At present, abandoned cropland has become a common phenomenon spreading to countries around the world. China has seen widespread abandoned cropland in recent years. However, there are extremely few empirical studies of cropland abandonment and influencing factors nationwide. In this study, survey data from 8071 farmer households in 14 Chinese provinces were used to analyze the degree of cropland abandonment in China and its spatial distribution. A multi-level model was constructed to quantitatively explore the socioeconomic factors affecting the degree of cropland abandonment, at both the farmer and district/county levels. The results show that: (1) the proportion of farmers and the spatial distribution of abandoned cropland are consistent. (2) Chongqing City, Guangdong Province, and Shanxi Province are high-value areas of abandoned cropland, while Shandong, Liaoning, Henan and Jiangsu provinces are low-value areas. (3) Among the differences in cropland abandonment, 68.5% and 31.5% can be explained at the farmer and district/county level, respectively. (4) At the farmer level, all labor and cropland transfer indicators, including land labor quantity per unit area, male agricultural labor ratio, farmers mainly of middle-aged labor, cropland transfer area and cropland subcontract amount, have significant negative effects on the degree of abandoned cropland. There is a significant negative correlation between the value of agricultural operating fixed assets in the agricultural input indicators and the degree of abandoned cropland, but participation in professional, cooperative, economic, agricultural organizations has no significant impact on the degree of abandoned cropland. The per capita disposable income, which represents the quality of life indicator, has a significant positive impact on the degree of abandoned cropland. (5) At the district/county level, the proportion of the total co-working labor force and the transfer rate of cropland are negatively related to the degree of cropland abandonment, and the proportion of the co-working labor force outside the district/county is positively related to the degree of cropland abandonment. In addition, we briefly analyzed the mechanism and process of cropland abandonment from the perspective of farmers' decision-making. Finally, the policy suggestions to alleviate the abandonment of cropland were put forward from the district/county and farmer level, respectively.

TI  - Co-designing win-win partnerships between agro-industries and smallholders in the palm oil sector in Cameroon
T2  - BIOTECHNOLOGIE AGRONOMIE SOCIETE ET ENVIRONNEMENT
AB  - Description of the subject. To boost the development of the national palm oil sector, one of the most promising moves for the Cameroonian government would be to improve partnerships between agro-industries and smallholders in order to increase the latter's plantation yields and oil extraction rates.
   Objectives. Drawing on successful experiences in Southeast Asia, this paper examines the conditions for establishing a winwin partnership between agro-industrial companies and smallholders in the Cameroonian palm oil sector.
   Method. The study was carried out in three production basins in the Centre and the Southwest regions of Cameroon where such partnerships were initiated before the collapse of the National Aid Fund for Rural Development (FONADER) in the 1970s. In participatory workshops involving at least twelve stakeholders (palm oil producers, artisanal and industrial millers, intermediaries and agricultural extension services), the participants' knowledge was integrated together through individual and collective reflection, with a guarantee of equal expression and consideration of views. Two workshops followed a strict adaptation of Participatory Prospective Analysis (PPA); a third followed a semi-directed participatory approach. Interactions between participants produced definitions of the systems studied and the variables involved, different plausible future scenarios, and recommendations for decision making.
   Results. Access to technical and managerial capacity building, terms of the contract, access to shareholding in the company by smallholders, and legalization of the terms of the contract emerged as the major items that would influence a sustainable partnership between agro-industries and smallholders.
   Conclusions. Participatory derived recommendations show that long-term partnerships between agro-industry and smallholders depend on a negotiated contract agreement between the partners to ensure transparency and trust. In addition, a dedicated smallholder department in charge of village plantations within agro-industrial companies can facilitate communication between partners.

TI  - Development of the rural health insurance system in China
T2  - HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB  - Ever since the collapse of the once successful Rural Cooperative Medical System (RCMS) in the early 1980s, when China transformed its system of collective agricultural production to private production, many rural communities, especially the poorer residents, have faced several major problems. In 1993, insurance coverage for rural residents was already low, at 12.8%. By 1998, only 9.5% of the rural population was insured. User charges have effectively blocked access for many rural residents who lack adequate income to purchase basic health care when needed.
   Impoverishment due to medical expenses is also a serious problem, which begs the question: why has there been no vigorous development of the rural health insurance system in China despite the country's rapid economic growth? This paper analyzes the major underlying reasons for the lack of rural health insurance in China. We found that lack of demand for the voluntary community financing schemes and inadequate government policies are the two major hindrances. Recently, the Chinese government announced a new rural health financing policy that relies on 'matching-funds' by the central and local governments as well as household contributions. The potential for success of this new model might be inferred from China's past experiences, as well as from the pilot projects that are underway.

TI  - Effect of socioeconomic and institutional factors and sustainable land management practices on soil fertility in smallholder farms in the Mahottari District, Nepal
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Soil fertility decline is a serious global problem, leading to a decline in crop yields and jeopardizing household food security, particularly in developing countries. This paper examines the impact of socioeconomic and institutional factors and the adoption of sustainable land management practices on soil fertility changes on farms between 2002 and 2018 in the Mahottari District of Nepal. A household survey among 184 smallholder farmers was conducted in 2018 to complement soil survey data collected in 2002. A seemingly unrelated regression model was used to estimate factors influencing soil fertility changes between the two periods. The results showed that soil organic matter (SOM), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and soil pH increased, on average, by about 0.2%, 97 kg/ha, 4 kg/ha, and 0.5 scales, respectively, on the studied farms. The regression results indicated that extension visits and government support (free seedlings) had positive effects, while cooperative membership negatively affected soil fertility changes. Moreover, practicing fallow land use improved soil fertility changes on farms, while practicing conventional tillage using animals deteriorated soil fertility changes. The adoption of agroforestry practices positively affected changes in P and K and negatively affected SOM. Overall, this study highlighted the importance of institutional characteristics and sustainable land management practices to improve soil fertility. The policy implications of these findings for enhancing soil fertility on smallholder farms are: (1) increase the frequency of extension visits to share relevant information with farmers; and (2) incentivize farmers to adopt agroforestry and fallowing practices on their farms.

TI  - E-commerce Adoption and Technical Efficiency of Wheat Production in China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Improving technical efficiency (TE) is crucial for the sustainable growth of smallholder agriculture in developing countries. While there has been a large literature investigating the determinants of smallholders' agricultural technical efficiency, little is known about the effect of e-commerce on agriculture and crop production efficiency despite the growing importance of rural e-commerce in developing countries. This study, therefore, bridges the research gap by examining the impact of e-commerce adoption on TE using household survey data of wheat farmers in China. We employ the combination of propensity score matching (PSM) and a selectivity-corrected stochastic production frontier model to address the possible selection biases stemming from both observable and unobservable factors. We found that e-commerce adoption would lead to a 2.75 per cent increase in the technical efficiency of wheat production. Our study also complements the existing research of rural e-commerce, which mainly focuses on the benefits of e-commerce from the perspective of market opportunity and farmers' welfare.

TI  - Institutional Strategy of Palm Oil Independent Smallholders: A Case Study in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This article aims to describe the institutional structuring strategy of independent smallholders in accelerating sustainable economic development, by taking the example of the cow-coconut integration system (SISKA) problem in Sialang Palas Village, Riau. The method used identified stakeholders related to SISKA; the stakeholder's goals and interests, farmers' social and institutional bases, and self-help farmer socio-economic networks. First, identification of various factors through strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis techniques. Second, through the Modern Political Economy analysis technique. Third, imparting knowledge and skills to the farmers and village officials through a collective learning process in utilizing natural resource waste and social resources. The results showed that the farmer management strategy in the reform era started by clustering the interests of farmers. The dynamics of structuring group relations between the chairman and members with farmers outside the group are the basis for strengthening the local ideology of independence in the future. This institutional structuring strategy that focuses on access to farm power in the village decision-making process encourages a more integrated work of farmer organizations. The analysis above shows that the independent smallholder institutional engineering through regulation, organization, and resources are determined by the farmer household economic factors and the application of the value of local wisdom.

TI  - Childhood Nutrition in Rural China: What Impact Does Public Health Insurance Have?
T2  - VALUE IN HEALTH
AB  - Objectives: To investigate the impact of public health insurance coverage, specifically the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), on childhood nutrition in poor rural households in China, and to identify the mechanisms through which health insurance coverage affects nutritional intake.
   Methods: Longitudinal data on 3291 children were taken from four time periods (2004, 2006, 2009, and 2011) from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). Panel data analysis was performed with the fixed-effect model and the propensity score matching with difference-in-differences (PSM-DID) approach.
   Results: The introduction of the NCMS was associated with a decline in calories, fat, and protein intake, and an increase in the intake of carbohydrates. The NCMS had the greatest negative effect on children aged 0 to 5 years, particularly girls. Out-of-pocket medical expenses were identified as the main channel through which the NCMS affected the nutritional intake of children.
   Conclusions: The study showed that the NCMS neither significantly improved the nutritional status of children nor enhanced intake of high-quality nutrients among rural poor households. These findings were attributed to the way in which health-seeking behavior was modified in the light of NCMS coverage. Specifically, NCMS coverage tended to increase healthcare utilization, which in turn increased out-of-pocket medical expenditures. This encouraged savings to aid financial risk protection and resulted in less disposable income for food consumption.

TI  - Member checking: A feminist participatory analysis of the use of preliminary results pamphlets in cross-cultural, cross-language research
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Participation and reflexivity have become buzzwords that are seldom discussed in terms of their practical employment. Against this backdrop, with a specific focus on geography, this article presents and analyzes the advantages and limitations of a methodological tool that seeks to enhance both reflexivity and participation. The tool was a pamphlet written in local languages that contained several pictures and summarized the data gathered in previous fieldwork sessions. This tool was used in a four-year research project on the gender division of labor in smallholder irrigation farming in Kenya and Tanzania. The pamphlet showed participants their contributions to the research process and offered them the opportunity to correct, improve and further discuss previously collected data. It not only ensured research validity but also allowed for a shift in the research power hierarchy. Finally, the pamphlet effectively created a space for inclusion, discussion and reciprocal learning, leading to collective reflexivity and catalytic validity by empowering participants and re-orienting the researcher.

TI  - Adoption of Direct Seeding, Yield and Fertilizer Use in Rice Production: Empirical Evidence from China
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Direct seeding has been widely adopted in rice production due to its advantages of water-and labor-saving characteristics in China and other countries. This study aims to examine the effects of farmers' adoption of direct seeding on the yield and fertilizer use in rice production in China. Using survey data of 1002 rice farmers in the Yangtze River Basin in China, the endogenous switching regression model is used to address the self-selectivity bias from both observed and unobserved heterogeneity. The results show that about 79% of surveyed farmers adopted direct seeding in rice production. After addressing the self-selectivity bias, the adoption of direct seeding increased rice yield among the adopters by 3.65%, and would have increased rice yield among the non-adopters by 1.54% if direct seeding had been adopted. In addition to its positive effect on rice yield, however, the adoption of direct seeding was also found to increase fertilizer use among the adopters by 19.84%, and would have increased fertilizer use among the non-adopters by 37.75% if direct seeding had been adopted. Moreover, farmers' adoption of direct seeding exerted heterogeneous effects on rice yield and fertilizer use in terms of farm size and location.

TI  - Patterns of revenue distribution in rural residential land consolidation in contemporary China: The perspective of property rights delineation
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Rural residential land consolidation (RRLC) in contemporary China refers to activities related to the replanning and reallocation of rural residential land to construct new rural residences, to increase land-use efficiency and to improve rural amenities in the context of rural revitalization. The objective of this study is to elucidate the patterns of revenue distribution in RRLC by addressing the following questions. Given incomplete and ambiguous formal rules in China, how can rural land property rights be delineated to distribute and coordinate interests among stakeholders in RRLC? Furthermore, what are the factors that determine the delineation of rural land property rights to distribute land revenue? A theoretical framework for the delineation of rural land property rights is developed from the perspectives of the institutional environment, governance and resource allocation. A comparative analysis of two typical cases of RRLC in contemporary China is conducted to support the research hypotheses. This study finds that bargaining power is the fundamental determinant of delineating rural land property rights to distribute revenue in RRLC. Furthermore, intergovernmental competition motivates the local government to fully deploy strong bargaining power, while concerns about social stability provide some constraints. A strong capability for collective action reinforces the bargaining power of rural households. This study provides new insights into the delineation of rural land property rights and subsequent revenue distribution based on distinctive institutional settings and RRLC in China, enriching the theoretical and empirical findings in the property rights school. Policy recommendations on revenue sharing of RRLC are proposed accordingly.

T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES
AB  - The Paddar Valley, historically known as Sapphire Valley situated in Kishtwar district, is a prime landmark in the Jammu region of J&K state and is known for its rich cultural and plant diversity because of diverse habitats such as rivers, streams, meadows and steep mountain slopes. The area is located in the dry temperate region comprising typical vegetation which disappears completely on the eastern slopes, dominated by a variety of economical species which play an important role in the rural life. The inhabitants are dependent on plant resources for food, fuel, timber, shelter, fodder/forage, household articles and traditional medicines in treating diseases like malaria, cancer, gastro-intestinal ailments, etc. This paper deals with the observations on traditional therapeutic application by the inhabitants of Paddar Valley. The ethno-botanical information on medicinal plants would not only be useful in conservation of traditional cultures and biodiversity but also community health care and drug development. Exploration survey in Paddar Valley has revealed that people collect and sell these medicinal species through local intermediaries / contractors to earn their livelihood. But the scientific cultivation and appropriate post-harvest management would improve employment opportunity and income of local farmers in the region.

TI  - CATASTROPHIC MEDICAL PAYMENT AND FINANCIAL PROTECTION IN RURAL CHINA: EVIDENCE FROM THE NEW COOPERATIVE MEDICAL SCHEME IN SHANDONG PROVINCE
T2  - HEALTH ECONOMICS
AB  - Objective: To measure the impact of China's New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) on catastrophic medical payments of rural households in Linyi County, Shandong Province.
   Method: In 2005, from a stratified cluster sample of 3101 rural households, we identified 375 households that might be at risk of catastrophic payments by searching through NCMS claims and interviewing key informants. We interviewed these 375 households and confirmed that 231 had had catastrophic payments (>= 40% of file households' capacity to pay; CTP) during 2004. A validity test of our screening method found another eight cases among immediate neighbours of these 375 households; by extrapolation, we obtained an adjusted total of 289 catastrophic households in the sample of 3101. We measured the impact of the NCMS on hardship alleviation by counterfactual analysis, comparing catastrophic payments before and after NCMS reimbursements.
   Result: The effect was twofold. Before NCMS intervention 8.98% of Linyi population had had catastrophic out-of-pocket payments compared with 8.25% after reimbursements. Catastrophic severity for households remaining in catastrophe after reimbursement dropped by 18.7% to an average of 6.34 times the household's CTP.
   Conclusion: Out-of-pocket medical payments remain a burden for rural households. Financial protection from the NCMS, with ail average reimbursement of 17.8%, was modest and should be restructured to provide better benefits that are targeted to those in most need.

TI  - Access to social insurance in urban China: A comparative study of rural-urban and urban-urban migrants in Beijing
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Since 1958 the hukou (household registration) system has assigned Chinese citizens either a rural or urban status. Some studies argue that the rural-to-urban migrants in China who do not have urban hukou are not entitled to urban social insurance schemes, due to institutional discrimination, Which applies differing treatment to urban and rural hukou (chengxiang fenge). Although rural urban migrants participate less in the social insurance system than their counterparts with urban hukou, a closer examination of recent policy developments shows that migrants actually do have the legal right to access the system. This implies that discrimination between rural and urban workers has been declining, and distinctions based on household registration status are less able to explain China's current urban transition. This paper provides a new way of examining Chinese migrants' social insurance participation, by adopting a framework that includes both rural-to-urban migrants and urban-to-urban migrants, which are an important, but less studied, migrant group. Among our key findings are that urban migrants are more likely to sign a labour contract than rural migrants; urban migrants have higher participation rates in social insurance than rural migrants; having a labour contract has a greater impact than hukou status in determining whether Beijing's floating population accesses social insurance; and urban migrants who have signed a labour contract have higher participation rates in social insurance than either rural migrants or urban migrants without a labour contract.

TI  - A history of tobacco production and marketing in Malawi, 1890-2010
T2  - JOURNAL OF EASTERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - During the past century tobacco production and marketing in Nyasaland/Malawi has undergone periods of dynamism similar to changes since the early 1990s. This article highlights three recurrent patterns. First, estate owners have fostered or constrained peasant/smallholder production dependent on complementarities or competition with estates. Second, the rapid expansion of peasant/smallholder production has led to large multiplier effects in tobacco-rich districts. Third, such expansion has also led to re-regulation of the marketing of peasant/smallholder tobacco by the (colonial) state. The article concludes by assessing whether recent changes in the industry - such as district markets, contract farming with smallholders, and the importance of credence factors - have historical precedents, or are new developments in the industry.

TI  - Impact of Index Insurance on Moral Hazard in the Agricultural Credit Market: Theory and Evidence from Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES
AB  - Recent research suggests that coupling microfinance loans with an index insurance policy may be a cost-effective way to expand credit market access to smallholder farmers in developing countries. Index insurance can increase demand for credit and encourage increased supply of credit by protecting borrowers and lenders from covariate production shocks that discourage credit market expansion. In this paper, we propose that index insurance, when bundled with credit, may also reduce a different barrier to credit market access: high transaction costs caused by moral hazard in the credit market. We develop a theoretical model of a competitive credit market with moral hazard. In this market, lenders use either dynamic incentives or collateral to mitigate the moral hazard problem. The model shows that index insurance bundled with loan contracts can reduce moral hazard and increase borrower welfare. We then test the model and find some empirical support using a subset of data from a randomised control trial in northern Ghana.

TI  - Impacts of tenure security and market-oriented allocation of farmland on agricultural productivity: Evidence from China's apple growers
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Whether impacts of tenure insecurity and thin farmland rental markets on agricultural productivity were significant or not was still a key issue that needed to be empirically answered for most developing countries. Thus, the main objectives of this paper were to analyze the influencing mechanisms of tenure security and market oriented allocation of farmland on agricultural productivity. We collected 762 household-level and 1163 plot level survey data from China's apple growers. The results indicated that: (i) agricultural productivity in rented plots was not significantly lower than that in owned plots due to insignificant negative impacts of rented plots on agricultural investment. Further, longer-term farmland rental contract significantly increased yield in rented plots by enhancing agricultural investment; (ii) farmland rental market participation could transfer farmland from low-productivity farmers to high-productivity farmers, and expanding farm size was conducive to increasing the number of agricultural machines input, which improved agricultural productivity. Based on our empirical findings, we suggest that (i) central government should continue to expand and improve the reforms of farmland property rights systems; (ii) long-term farmland rental contract should be encouraged in practice, and relevant laws and regulations should be improved; (iii) the role of rural collective economic organization (RCEO) should be fully employed to reduce execution costs of farmland rental contract; (iv) farmland rental markets should be actively developed, and the costs of agricultural machines input should be reduced.

However, as individual production volumes are low, smallholder farmers need to cooperate in certification as a group, which makes impact assessment more complicated. Previous empirical studies, reporting premia of up to 30%, have neglected the costs associated with group certification. We explore the issue using an agent-based simulation of coffee producer organisations in Uganda, including the certification-related costs for farmers. Our results suggest that certification can have a small positive impact on participating households. But the added value of certification is substantially lower than the price premium, because of certification costs. Increasing both the membership of the producer groups and their deliveries of certified coffee are necessary to improve the rewards of certification.

TI  - Fair Trade-Organic Coffee Cooperatives, Migration, and Secondary Schooling in Southern Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - We explore three trends in rural southern Mexico (Fair Trade coffee, migration, and conditional cash transfers) that could explain the rapid rise in education from 1995-2005 using survey data from 845 coffee farming households in Oaxaca and Chiapas, Mexico. Results from a household fixed-effects model show that household participation in a Fair Trade-organic cooperative contributed to about a 0.7 year increase in schooling for girls. US migration opportunities appear to have even stronger positive impacts on schooling for females. Although participation in Fair Trade-organic cooperatives appears also to have increased male schooling, increased migration opportunities have had an indeterminate effect for males.

TI  - Social Capital Typologies and Sustainable Development: Spatial Patterns in the Central and Southern Regions of Malawi
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Bonding, bridging and linking social capital can be a useful mechanism to promote sustainable development in low-income countries. Social capital typologies vary spatially, with the rural poor having a specific combination. Similarly, bonding, bridging and linking social capital's association with sustainable development is also likely to differ spatially across a country, but there is limited research in low-income countries. This study aims to improve understanding of the spatial variation of bonding, bridging and linking social capital in low-income countries using Malawi as a case study. Using secondary data and spatial statistics, including kriging and geographically weighted regression, we explore the spatial variation of social capital typologies and their spatial associations with various sustainable development indicators. There were three key combinations of bonding, bridging and linking social capital, which differ from the standard model of social capital typologies for the rural poor. We also found social capital's association with sustainable development indicators depends on the social capital typology, study area and the sustainable development indicator in question. With this in mind, development practitioners, researchers and policymakers should aim to understand the specific social capital context prior to sustainable development research or project implementation.

TI  - CONTRIBUTING FACTORS AND RESTRICTIONS TO THE PARTICIPATION OF RURAL WOMEN IN CASSAVA PROCESSING IN ISIUKWUATO AREA OF ABIA STATE, NIGERIA
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Women play a crucial role in the Nigerian Agricultural sector ranging from production to processing and marketing. About 80% of small scale cassava clusters in the western part of Nigeria are owned and operated by women. The study sought to analyse the restrictions and factors that contribute to the participation of rural women in cassava processing in Isiukwuato area of Abia State, Nigeria. Multistage sampling technique was employed in the selection of eighty (80) respondents from whom data were elicited. Data were analysed usiry descriptive statistics and the probit regression model. The result showed that the respondents were young ((X) over bar 44.19), with majority married (78.75%), had a mean household size of ((X) over bar 5.16) persons, attained various levels of education but were small scale farmers with a mean farm size of (1.98) hectares. The probit regression estimate showed that the coefficients of age, education level, farm income, cooperative membership, household size and extension contact influenced the participation of the respondents in cassava processing at varied levels of significance. The model posted a pseudo R-2 of (0.6303). Like every other business, the respondents faced restrictions like poor storage facilities, low quality of cassava roots, discolouration and uncontrolled fermentation, inadequate supply of cassava roots all year round among others. Based on the findings, the study suggested the introduction of contract farming in the area, which will ensure a reliable supply of cassava roots for large scale processing and incorporating gender perspective into all agricultural interventions by the government to ensure equal impact.

TI  - Livelihood strategies and the role of livestock in the processes of adaptation to drought in the Coastal Zone of Western Desert (Egypt)
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Analyses of the roles of livestock in household livelihood in the context of global change and the different stresses triggered by such changes are not rare. However, the many changes that threaten the actual functioning of the systems and trigger many uncertainties concerning capacities to adapt to external shocks require new research approaches. In this paper, we explore the links between capital assets, risk perception, measure of income, and livestock adaptation using a typology value based on multiple factorial analyses. We examine the specific role of livestock in the processes of adaptation to a 15-year drought. The study is based on a farm survey of 182 Bedouin families in the Coastal Zone of Western Desert of Egypt in 2011. Our results show that livestock is still a core component of Bedouin society with a significant typology value. However, for Bedouin families located inland, livestock is mainly an economic safety net in the case of drought; whereas for family members who recently moved to town, livestock is a social safety net vis-a-vis the traditional society which enables them to cope with economic hardship and participate in social events. How livestock is managed during drought events and the role of livestock in the process of adapting to drought depends less on the size of the herd before the drought in the rain-fed zone and more on traditional social and official networks. Consequently, limiting the impact of drought in this zone requires paying more attention to the management of collective action, including livestock policies and feed subsidies.

TI  - Income-related inequality in health insurance coverage: analysis of China Health and Nutrition Survey of 2006 and 2009
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB  - Introduction: China introduced the urban resident basic medical insurance (URBMI) in 2007 to cover children and urban unemployed adults, in addition to the new cooperative medical scheme (NCMS) for rural residents in 2003 and the basic health insurance scheme (BHIS) for urban employees in 1998. This study examined whether the overall income-related inequality in health insurance coverage improved during 2006 and 2009 in China.
   Methods: The China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data of 2006 and 2009 were used to create the concentration curve and the concentration index. GEE logistic regression was used to model the health insurance coverage as dependent variable and household income per capita as independent variable, controlling for individuals' age, gender, marital status, educational attainment, employment status, year 2009 (Y2009), household size, retirement status, and geographic variations. The change in the income-related inequality in 2009 was estimated using the interaction term of income*Y2009.
   Results: In 2006, 49.7% (4,712/9,476) respondents had health insurance: 13.4% with BHIS and 28.4% with NCMS. In 2009, 90.8% (8,964/9,863) had health insurance: 10.1% with URBMI, 18.3% with BHIS, and 57.6% with NCMS. The BHIS, URBMI, and NCMS programs had different patterns of population coverage over 10 income deciles. The concentration index was 0.15 in 2006 and 0.04 in 2009. The dominance test showed that the concentration curves were significantly different between 2006 and 2009 (p < 0.05). An income increase per capita by 10,000 RMB was associated with 25.5% more likely to have health insurance coverage (odds ratio = 1.255, 95% confidence interval: [1.130-1.393]). In 2009, there was significant improvement in the income-related inequality (p < 0.001).
   Discussions: Comparing 2009 to 2006, the income inequality in health insurance coverage was largely corrected in China through rapid expansion of CHNS in rural areas and initiation of URBMI in urban areas.

TI  - Resource Endowment, Rural Governance, and the "New Agriculture" in China
T2  - MODERN CHINA
AB  - China's "new agriculture," characterized by a "capital-labor dual intensifying" pattern of production, is an effective way of linking small peasants with modern agriculture. Based on a field survey of several neighboring villages in Nijingzhen, Hebei, this article describes and compares each village's level of agricultural development, and how the new agriculture differs within them. The analysis reveals that both soil texture and land layout affect the ability of villages to adopt new agricultural technologies that characterize the new agriculture. The current land layout is determined by the land division rules that are collectively made by villagers under village self-governance and deeply influenced by the effectiveness of rural governance. "Capable rural people," family surname and clan structures, and the structure of peasant households, in addition to the choice to remain in the villages, interact with each other and affect the effectiveness of village governing authorities. In turn, the development of the new agriculture impacts the inflow and outflow of the rural labor force, and whether villagers remain in the village, which in turn affects rural governance and social stratification.

TI  - Designating tree crops as forest: Land competition and livelihood effects mediate tree crops impact on natural forest cover in south China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The Chinese government applies the term 'tree crops' (jingjilin) to a bundle of tree species with uses other than timber production, defining this category as a component of national forest statistics. Tree crops may displace either farmland or forestland, and can be a promising livelihood option for smallholders. The overall impact of this particular policy on natural forest growth remained unanswered. In the general expansion trend of tree cover in southern China, tree crops could compete for land with natural forests, their cultivation may pose environmental trade-offs with natural forest cover. However, in a context of large labor flows from countryside to cities, tree crops could provide promising opportunities for dealing with on-farm labor shortages and generating income for disadvantaged populations remaining in rural communities, then promoting remaining natural forest quality through alternative livelihoods process. There is a knowledge gap to thoroughly investigate tree crops' impact on natural forest change both conceptually and empirically, especially a mechanism verification of the alternative livelihood hypothesis. Thus, we construct a framework assessing land use competition and alternative livelihood effects together to assess overall impacts of tree crop cultivation on natural forests. Our dataset combines forest resource inventory data and provincial social-economic factors for a panel analysis of contributions to change in natural forest cover, density, and stock in China's biodiversity-rich southern provinces. Results show tree crop cover is negatively associated with natural forest extent, but positive associated with change in natural forest density, while the relationship with change in natural forest stock is insignificant. Further tests of mechanisms support the hypothesis that tree crops benefit disadvantaged rural populations, providing an alternative livelihood. Defining tree crops as forest in China obscures important patterns, particularly a trade-off between tree crops and natural forest cover and a possible synergy with natural forest density mediated by alternative livelihood processes. Policy makers should enact specific policies to incentivize natural forest recovery in the southern collective forest zone and reconsider the appropriateness of defining tree crops as forest. Concentration and intensification of tree crop production on suitable lands may have the potential to benefit both forests and impoverished populations.

TI  - Investments and returns from cooperative and household managed woodlots in Zimbabwe: Implications for rural afforestation policy
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - For several decades, the Zimbabwean government, donors, and NGOs have actively promoted the establishment of cooperative woodlots in Zimbabwe's communal areas. However, despite the provision of considerable extension support and subsidies to these cooperatives, household woodlots are far more common. This paper investigates the motivations of households and groups in Zimbabwe's communal areas to plant trees.
   Estimates of private economic returns suggest that cooperative woodlots are generally more profitable than household managed woodlots. However, household managed tree planting yields higher economic returns in the absence of subsidized land and other inputs. Statistical analysis indicates that, relative to cooperatively managed woodlots, household managed woodlots tend to be associated with access to non-timber benefits such as windbreaks, and access to market benefits through harvesting. However, relative to cooperatively managed woodlots, household managed woodlots receive less extension advice, and are associated with lower projected private returns because of subsidies provided to cooperative woodlot groups.
   Although the literature on cooperative management is replete with examples of successful cases, for the case of woodlots in Zimbabwe, it appears as though policy makers may be promoting the wrong management option. Household management of woodlots, rather than cooperative management, may provide greater economic returns, and accordingly better incentives, for the adoption of tree planting.

TI  - Prioritization of sustainability indicators for promoting the circular economy: The case of developing countries
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - The concept of the circular economy has gained well-recognition across the world for the past decades. With the heightening risk of the impact of climate change, resource scarcity to meet the increasing world population, the need to transition to a more sustainable development model is urgent. The circular economy is often cited as one of the best solutions to support sustainable development. However, the diffusion of this concept in the industrial arena is still relatively slow, particularly in the developing country, which collectively exerts high potential to be the world's largest economies and workforce. It is crucial to make sure that the development of these nations is sustainable and not bearing on the cost of future generations. Thus, this work aims to provide a comprehensive review of the circular economy concept in developing country context. Furthermore, a novel model is proposed by adopting Fuzzy Analytics Network Process (FANP) to quantify the priority weights of the sustainability indicators to provide guidelines for the industry stakeholders at different stages of industry cycle to transition toward the circular economy. The results revealed that improvement in economic performance and public acceptance are the key triggers to encourage stakeholders for sustainable development. The outcomes serve as a reference to enhance the overall decision-making process of industry stakeholders. Local authorities can adopt the recommendations to design policy and incentive that encourage the adoption of circular economy in real industry operation to spur up economic development, without neglecting environmental well-being and jeo-pardizing social benefits.

TI  - Changes in resident attitudes towards tourism development and conservation in the Okavango Delta, Botswana
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Negative attitudes of resident communities towards conservation are associated with resource decline in developing countries. In Botswana, Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) was adopted to address this challenge. CBNRM links rural development and conservation. However, the impact of CBNRM on changes of resident attitudes towards conservation and tourism is not adequately researched. This paper, therefore, assesses the impacts of CBNRM on resident attitudes towards tourism development and conservation in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. The study purposively sampled villages of Khwai, Mababe and Sankoyo. Household data using variables like: economic benefits from CBNRM; level of satisfaction with CBNRM; co-management of natural resources between resident communities and government agencies; and collective action was collected. This data was supplemented by secondary and ethnographic data. Using qualitative and quantitative analysis, results indicate changes in resident attitudes from being negative to positive towards tourism and conservation. These changes are triggered by economic benefits residents derived from CBNRM, co-management in resource management; and, collective action of communities in CBNRM development. Positive attitudes towards conservation and tourism are the first building blocks towards achieving conservation in nature-based tourism destinations. As a result, decision-makers should give priority to CBNRM and use it as a tool to achieve conservation and improved livelihoods in nature-based tourism destinations of developing countries.

TI  - The emergence of collectively owned self-supply water supply systems in rural South Africa - what can we learn from the Tshakhuma case in Limpopo?
T2  - WATER SA
AB  - Despite the rapid extension of public service delivery since the end of Apartheid, many rural citizens in South Africa still rely on their own initiatives and infrastructure to access water. They construct, improve, operate and maintain infrastructure of different complexities, from individual wells to complex collectively owned water schemes. While most of these schemes operate without legal recognition, they provide essential services to many households. In this article we will first provide an overview of the growing international body of literature describing self-supply as an alternative pathway for public service delivery. We then take a historical perspective on the role of communities and self-supply in South Africa and describe the emergence of six collectively owned, gravity-fed, piped schemes in Tshakhuma, Limpopo Province. We describe and compare these systems using key characteristics like resource access, investment, construction, operation, maintenance and institutional governance. We further assess their performance with regard to coverage, service level, reliability, governance structure, accountability and water quality. We do so because we are convinced that lessons learned from studying such schemes as locally adapted prototypes have the potential to improve public approaches to service delivery. The described cases show the willingness of community members to engage with service delivery and their ability to provide services in cases where the state has failed. The assessment also highlights problematic aspects of self-supply related to a lack of accountability, technical expertise and the exclusion of disadvantaged community members. By describing and assessing the performance of rural self-supply schemes, we aim to recognize, study and learn from such schemes. We consequently do not conclude this article by providing answers, but by raising some pertinent, policy-relevant questions.

TI  - Does Bonga sheep producers' cooperative membership improve households' income in southern Ethiopia?
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Bonga sheep is one among the known indigenous sheep breeds in Ethiopia with a high rate of growth and weight gain under smallholder management. To enhance the sheep productivity, 16 Bonga sheep breed improvement cooperatives were established in Kaffa zone of southern Ethiopia. Even though the cooperatives bring success in terms of breed improvement and income generation, there's no empirical evidence of this. Thus, this study was intended to identify factors affecting cooperative membership and estimate its impact on farmers' income. To do this, data from 320 sampled households were collected by using multistage sampling techniques. For analysis, the endogenous switching regression (ESR) model was employed. The result of ESR estimation shows that the probability of farmers' membership decision is decided by the number of sheep owned, extension contact, and proximity to a cooperative office. The model results further confirm that members get significantly better (34%) than if they had not been members and non-members would have even performed better (56%) than members if they had joined cooperatives. This suggests sheep breeding cooperatives are effective in improving the income of sheep producers. Thus, efforts need to be made to tackle factors that are impeding households' cooperative participation. Further, strengthening of the existing cooperatives and establishment of additional cooperatives is suggested.

TI  - Participatory Action Research, Social Networks, and Gender Influence Soil Fertility Management in Tanzania
T2  - SYSTEMIC PRACTICE AND ACTION RESEARCH
AB  - Transformation of knowledge systems and fostering learning among smallholder farmers such as through participatory action research (PAR) is key to agricultural growth in rural sub-Saharan Africa. We investigate how PAR influences uptake/use of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) while accounting for gendered, bonding and bridging social capital. Stratified by engagement in a mother-baby PAR and by resource endowments, 607 smallholder farmers were sampled from northern Tanzania. Binary logistic and multinomial logit models revealed that full engagement in PAR was associated with early adoption of inorganic fertilizers, either as a dichotomous decision or an ISFM bundle with improved varieties, organic matter inputs and soil and water conservation. Bonding social capital through cooperatives, farmer groups, and farmer-farmer local networks supports soil and water conservation, especially among resource-poor farmers. Among the high-resource farmers, increased women's bargaining power in farm input purchases supports fertilizer and manure use while increased bargaining power in livestock tending supports crop residue incorporation. ISFM usage is constrained by age of decision-makers and a higher number of dependents per worker while education level and farm sizes increase its likelihood. In the resource-constrained, with low extension and technical support, and men-dominated patrilineal farming systems of Africa, the study places PAR, social networks, and gender inclusivity as key approaches for improving smallholder' ISFM.

TI  - Trust and kinship: experimental evidence from rural India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMIC SCIENCE ASSOCIATION-JESA
AB  - The evidence on the welfare effects of kinship is mixed, suggesting both positive and adverse effects of kinship. This study looks into the differential effects of kinship on trusting and trustworthy behaviour by investigating the subjects' motives and drivers of differential behaviour towards kin and non-kin. We conducted an economic experiment with households of rural India. We found that kin are trusted more than non-kin and that differential trust towards kin and non-kin is mainly driven by higher other-regarding preferences towards kin rather than being due to differences in expected reciprocity between kin and non-kin. We observed a heterogeneous effect of kin on trustworthy behaviour: kin exhibit low trustworthiness when they are not close to other kin, while they exhibit higher trustworthiness when they have close kin in the network.

HIV infection and AIDS are non-notifiable conditions with a serious effect on forestry contracting businesses due to the effect on human resource productivity. The condition affects households as it burdens the household income, affects breadwinners and the family. With information available concerning the prevalence rate it is possible to anticipate the effects of HIV and AIDS in planning mitigation interventions to sustain quality of life and maintain the required levels of productivity. Deductions from age and individual income were that the younger people and those with a remuneration exceeding the average were at higher levels of infection. The number of children of infected people was lower than for uninfected people, but the household size of infected respondents were higher than the corresponding numbers of uninfected people.

TI  - Inferring informal risk-sharing regimes: Evidence from rural Tanzania
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - This paper studies informal risk-sharing regimes in a unified framework by examining households' intertemporal consumption behavior. We exploit a theoretically-consistent link between interest rates and cross-sectional consumption moments to test alternative risk-sharing models without requiring data on interest rates or assuming a restriction to eliminate the need for such data, which are often unavailable in developing economies. We specify tests that allow us to distinguish among models even with temporal dependence in income shocks. Using data from rural Tanzania we find that the consumption pattern is consistent with the self-insurance regime, and that risk aversion varies substantially across districts. Imposing a strict condition on interest rates, as often done in prior literature, misses their intertemporal heterogeneity and biases the estimation of risk aversion. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Ten-year impacts of China's rural health scheme: lessons for universal health coverage
T2  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - China has made profound progress in advancing universal health coverage (UHC) over the past two decades. New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) was initiated in 2003 to provide health insurance coverage to rural population. Its benefit packages and cost-sharing mechanism have changed significantly over time. This study aims to assess the impact of changing NCMS policies on NCMS enrollees' service utilisation, medical financial burden and equity between 2003 and 2013. Data are from China National Health Services Survey (NHSS) which is conducted every 5 years. We used the subsample of NHSS that were enrolled in NCMS in 2003, 2008 and 2013. From 2003 to 2013, we found increased service utilisation and an elimination of inequity in service utilisation with respect to income. Contradicting prior findings of increasing financial burden after the NCMS implementation, we identified significant protective effect of NCMS against financial risks, and a reduction in percentage of households with high medical expenditure in the middle-income and high-income quintiles. The rural residents from the low-income groups have high financial risk, therefore, should be the priority target for future reforms. In pursuit of UHC globally, many countries struggle to provide good coverage to the disadvantaged rural population and balance between the competing priorities of various UHC dimensions. Our trend analysis revealed China's two-stage approach with NCMS reform that first focused on expanding population coverage, then on service coverage and financial risk protection. This path could potentially be replicated in other middle-income and low-income countries to pave the way for UHC.

TI  - What is the influence of government programs on farmer organizations and their impacts? Evidence from Zambia
T2  - ANNALS OF PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - Governments and donors often promote farmer organizations (FOs) in the implementation of their agricultural development programs. Yet, there is a lot of uncertainty whether externally supported FOs provide benefits beyond the channelling of programs. This paper uses Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and representative data from 4,074 Zambian households to estimate FO impacts on members, with and without controlling for a national input-subsidy program. The results show that Zambian FOs tend to attract better-educated households with larger farm sizes, but can lead to female integration when external subsidies are involved. FOs also have a significantly positive effect on members' farm performance, irrespective of whether members receive input subsidies, while the presence of the external program leads to an unequal distribution of benefits within the FOs: positive impacts on farm performance are, on average 13-44% lower amongst members who do not benefit from the Zambian government program. Overall, these findings imply that Zambian FOs seem to provide benefits that go beyond the intention of the subsidy-program, which can be used to promote women empowerment and smallholder farm performance. The findings also demonstrate, however, that governments need to carefully design their programs to not reinforce inequality amongst farmer organizations and their members.

TI  - From Short to Longer Term Contracts: Factors Affecting Participation in Farmland Longer Rentals in Razan County, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Although it has some benefits, short-term farmland rental transactions have had negative consequences such as excessive use of water, overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and farmland degradation. Why are landowners more engaged in short-term land rental contracts and less involved in longer rental contracts, that are more associated with incentives to invest and sustainably use farmland? Based on a post positivist worldview, the present study has chosen a quantitative approach and used a survey strategy to explore factors affecting the participation of landholders in longer farmland rental markets. Using multi-stage sampling, 250 landholders in Razan County who had rented their land, at least once in the past five years, were selected. The study indicated that the landholders' motivations to rent out their farmlands changed by their place of residence (rural/urban). The identified barriers and drivers that require policy attention broadly focus on the security of farmland property rights, competence of tenants and kinship contracts, high risk and profitability of farming activities, and capital constraints in rural areas.

TI  - In-kind credit provision through contract farming and formal credit markets
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - Access to credit is a key prerequisite for the development of smallholder agriculture. However, rural credit markets are typically characterized by market failures and smallholder credit access is limited. Resource-providing contracts are an institutional tool to overcome credit market failures through the provision of production inputs in the form of in-kind credit. Previous research has shown that interlinkage of contract and credit helps farmers overcome financial constraints, foster production investments, and hence increase productivities and income. However, if and how such contract schemes affect farmers' overall demand for and access to formal credit from other sources is not yet well understood. In this article, we therefore investigate the associations of the provision of in-kind credit and farming households' formal credit demand and ability to receive formal credit. We use data of 463 oil palm producers in Ghana and show that participation in contract farming is associated with an increase in credit demand. Concerning credit approval, we find that the outstanding debt of the in-kind credit scheme is associated with a substantially lower likelihood of credit acceptance. However, the results also suggest that farmers can fully compensate this negative effect by informing the bank about the contract, and thus the source of the debt. This indicates that debt acquired from resource-providing contract schemes does not necessarily pose an additional credit constraint to farmers. [EconLit Citation G21, G23, O16, O17].

TI  - Why the Uncertain Term Occurs in the Farmland Lease Market: Evidence from Rural China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Urbanization and aging of the agricultural population lead to the insufficient supply of agricultural labor and land being idle in rural China, calling for the farmland lease market to maintain sustainable and efficient use of farmland. However, rural households tend to agree on an uncertain term for farmland leasing in/out, which leads to low efficiency and land loss in agriculture. Therefore, using the survey data collected from 2704 rural households and a logistic regression model, we examine the effects of risk faced by the rural households on the likelihood of the uncertain term for farmland leasing. Results reveal that a large share of labor with low education and high income increase the likelihood of an uncertain term for farmland leasing out activities, while a high disaster frequency, a high education of household and a high share of agricultural income increase the probability of an uncertain term for farmland leasing in activities. Additionally, leasing farmland to/from relatives or neighbors, informal contracts, low rent and the lack of pension insurance also increase the likelihood of the uncertain term for farmland leasing out/in activities. Findings suggest that more attention should be paid to education, agricultural insurance and social security system in rural areas.

TI  - Respiratory illnesses due to the use of firewood and charcoal in paraguayan communities
T2  - PEDIATRIA-ASUNCION
AB  - Introduction: The use of solid fuels is associated with more than 4 million premature deaths annually in the world, especially in women and children. The use of charcoal and firewood is still very prevalent in Paraguay, where 21% of the urban population and 71% of the rural population use these fuels for cooking. Objective: To describe the use of energy in the homes of two communities in Paraguay, a semi-urban and a rural one. Material and Methods: This was a descriptive and cross-sectional study that was carried out by means of a survey in 250 randomly selected households. Results: The analysis of the data obtained showed that more than 74% of households used charcoal, either as a primary or a secondary fuel. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was more commonly used in the semi-urban community (59%> 43%) and firewood was more used in the rural community (49.6%> 22.8%). The use of firewood implies a longer time for the collection, preparation and cooking of food. The use of firewood and charcoal was predominantly outdoors (84% of households) in kitchens without a fireplace. A higher prevalence of respiratory diseases was found in households that used charcoal or firewood (45%> 29%). The use of electricity for cooking was not very prevalent (only 7% used it as the main fuel). Conclusion: The prevalence of the use of charcoal and wood in homes vas high and has repercussions on collective health and favors the conditions of social inequality in the country. We suggest that promotion of electricity for cooking would be a viable clean alternative, because the country has large hydroelectric resources and the electric network covers almost the entire population (99%).

TI  - Rural Family Backgrounds, Higher Education, and Marriage Negotiations in Northwest China
T2  - MODERN ASIAN STUDIES
AB  - Since the early twentieth century, reforms of the social institution of marriage in China have profoundly curtailed the power of the senior generation to influence the marriage decisions of their offspring. Yet the marriage considerations of graduates from economically deprived rural family backgrounds in China's northwestern Gansu Province reveal a definite impact of feelings of social obligation towards the family as well as of a local understanding of marriage market stratification which (also) reflects these obligations. In this rural region, higher education mainly aims at long-term upward mobility into the formal urban sector of the economy. After all, the basic citizenship divide' between rural and urban residence rights established by the socialist hukou (household registration) system continues to determine rural families' structural exclusion from access to various urban resources. Feelings of indebtedness for financial and other support received from parents and family members during years of higher education entangle graduates from economically deprived rural family backgrounds in webs of social relations that oblige them to also consider the interests of others when deciding on whom to marry. When choosing a marriage partner they thus often face dilemmas of negotiating material versus emotional interests, as well as collective versus individual ones. While higher education empowers them to reject others' interference in their marriage decisions, if they do so, they have to cope with feelings of having disappointed all the hopes their supporters invested in them.

TI  - A participatory assessment of nitrified urine fertilizer use in Swayimane, South Africa: Crop production potential, farmer attitudes and smallholder challenges
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Long-term nutrient mining of soil hampers agricultural production across Africa. However, emerging sanitation technologies afford a hygienically safe and ecologically sustainable solution to this development challenge by providing fertilizers derived from human excreta that could facilitate a socio-technical transition toward a more sustainable food system. To evaluate one such technology, nitrified urine fertilizer (NUF), we conducted participatory action research to assess the potential, from both a biophysical and social perspective, of NUF to serve as a soil fertilizer to support smallholder agricultural production in Swayimane, South Africa. To achieve this objective, we formed a stakeholder group comprised of a cooperative of smallholder farmers, a local NGO (Zimele), and researchers from ETH Zurich and the University of Kwazulu-Natal. Over the course of two growing seasons (2016 and 2017) this stakeholder group assessed the potential of NUF to support smallholder vegetable production (i.e., cabbage). First, we adopted a randomized complete block design incorporating five treatments in season 1 (unfertilized control, nitrified urine, nitrified urine+bone meal, urea, and urea+diammonium phosphate (DAP) and six treatments (unfertilized control, urea, urea+DAP, DAP, nitrified urine, and nitrified urine+DAP) in season 2 to assess cabbage yield and leaf nutrient concentration (sodium, phosphorus, potassium, carbon, nitrogen). Although we observed large variability in yields, the urine-based treatments were as effective as any of the chemical fertilizers. Second, beyond the biophysical analysis, we elicited the challenges and opportunities of the smallholder farmers in our stakeholder group, as well as their attitudes toward the use of NUF as a fertilizer. Through this qualitative work, farmers indicated that their attitudes about the use of NUF as a fertilizer improved and that they would be willing to incorporate this product into their production practices if it was available at scale. Thus, we demonstrate the potential of participatory action research to co-produce knowledge and awareness around an innovative technology. In so doing, we provide evidence that this approach can support a change toward nutrient recycling-based agriculture.

TI  - Children of migrant parents: Migrating together or left behind
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Migrant parents in China are increasingly choosing to bring their children with them to their migration destination from their place of origin. This paper uses a 2016 migrant survey data to examine whether the likelihood of children living in their parents' migration destinations compared to those left in their places of origin has a correlation with parents' household characteristics, employment status and their participation in the social insurance scheme. Over all, older and better educated parents, longer migration history and infra-provincial move all predict higher likelihood of children moving with parents, the same as being the only child and born in destination cities, but not the child's gender. For the purpose of our analysis, children of migrant parents are disaggregated based on their urban or rural hukou status (household registration). Controlling for household characteristics, we find that migrant parents who have lower monthly savings, or who have access to local health insurance, or who do not have employment contracts are more likely to bring their children along if they are rural registered children. Access to pension could predict higher likelihood of children migration. Improving social insurance schemes for rural hukou migrants to make them at par with those for urban hukou migrants can remove discrepancies in the likelihood of their children's migration.

TI  - Experiences from the Implementation of Community-Based Goat Breeding Programs in Malawi and Uganda: A Potential Approach for Conservation and Improvement of Indigenous Small Ruminants in Smallholder Farms
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Maintaining diversity of small ruminant genetic resources is instrumental for sustainable agricultural production. Community-based livestock breeding programs (CBBPs) have emerged as a potential approach to implement breeding programs in smallholder farms. This study assesses the viability of CBBPs as a potential approach for conservation and improvement of indigenous small ruminants, using case studies of goat CBBPs in Malawi and Uganda. Data were collected using focus group discussions, personal interviews, and direct observations. The program promotes and empowers smallholders to have access to small ruminant feed resources through protection of existing communal pasturelands, capacity building in pasture production, and conservation of crop residues and crop by-products. Implementation of the CBBP enhances the contributions through improved animal growth performance, kids' survival, and twinning rates leading to increased offtake rates and better prices. The existence of permanently established supporting organizations and other stakeholders provides sustainable institutional support instrumental for the establishment and growth of CBBPs. However, establishment of functional community-based institutions (producer cooperatives) and investments in institutional/policy reforms to safeguard fair trading, access to common resources by small ruminant keepers, and adoption of the CBBP model into national livestock development programs are some of the key milestones that can guarantee sustainability.

TI  - Can cooperatives help commercial farms to access credit in China? Evidence from Jiangsu Province
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D AGROECONOMIE
AB  - Chinese agriculture is experiencing a transition from smallholder farming to the emergence of commercial farms that are characterized by intensification and specialization in production, as well as commercialization and cooperation in management. It requires substantial capital to facilitate such a transition, but it is very difficult for farmers in China to access bank credit. One way that commercial farms have to overcome such handicap is by organizing themselves into cooperatives. To assess the effect of cooperatives on the credit accessibility of commercial farms, we have developed a theoretical model as well as an empirical study of commercial farms in Jiangsu Province based on data from a survey of 754 commercial farm owners. Instrumental variable (IV) methods and the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method that control endogeneity problem are used in the analysis. The empirical results show that cooperatives have a significant positive impact on the credit access of commercial farms. Commercial farms participating in cooperatives may alleviated their credit constraints by about 17.3 percentage points and increase the average credit per capita by nearly 80,000 Yuan. Cooperatives improve the credit access of commercial farms by exerting strong market power and reputation effect based on its organizational advantages. A disaggregated analysis also reveals that small commercial farms tend to benefit more from cooperatives in improving credit access than large commercial farms.

TI  - Farming systems of the Loess Plateau, Gansu Province, China
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Gansu Province in north western China contains a large portion of China's rural poor. Within this province we compared extant farming systems in lower and higher rainfall areas of the Loess Plateau. The farming systems were dominated by subsistence winter wheat production in the higher rainfall more productive area (Qingyang), and subsistence spring wheat in the lower rainfall less productive area (Dingxi). Once household grain production is satisfied, remaining land is allocated to cash crop and livestock enterprises. Similar farm sizes (ca. 1 ha) in both areas meant that farmers in the more productive Qingyang area were easily able to meet household food needs and produce more cash income from sale of produce. They have reinvested this into their farms and are now developing new enterprises, particularly livestock and cooperative trading arrangements. This has allowed many of these farmers to move away from subsistence grain production, such that 72% of household income is now derived from sale of farm produce. However, many farmers in Qingyang indicated a lack of technical agronomic support and limited access to reliable markets as barriers to diversification. In Dingxi, many farmers struggle to grow sufficient grain for household use and generate very little cash income, often insufficient to provide basic needs such as education. Potatoes, pea and oilseeds are the most common cash crops here, but livestock enterprises are poorly developed. In this area only 28% of household income is generated on farm, and young males often leave the farm to work in larger cities, leaving farming decisions to the elderly, women, and children, who are left behind to manage the farm. High illiteracy rates in this group reduce assimilation of new information. Farmers in Dingxi indicated that restricted access to capital, lack of technical agronomic support and little access to trading markets were serious impediments to the development of more profitable enterprises.

TI  - Cottage sugar industries as alternatives for meeting Nigeria's domestic sugar demands
T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - The sugar industry in Nigeria has failed to meet the domestic sugar consumption demands of the country. The combined production figure of the two major sugar companies at Bacita and Numan stands at less than 1% of the requirement. Inconsistent government policies, uncontrolled sugar imports and the capital-intensive nature of large-scale sugar production could all account for this inadequate production level. The National Cereals Research Institute (NCRI) has developed a 10 tonnes of cane per day (tcd) mini brown sugar plant suitable for cottage level sugar production to complement the large-scale plants' efforts. Outgrower schemes currently operated by the Nigerian Sugar Company, Bacita and the Savannah Sugar Company, Numan are potential sources of the raw materials needed by these cottage industries when established in all the sugar cane-growing communities of Nigeria. Newly opened up farm areas of up to 100,000 ha will also provide canes for the plants. This paper presents some of the problems militating against profitable sugar production by large-scale sugar plants in Nigeria. It also highlights areas of cooperation and support by policy makers and other stakeholders in the sugar industry for increased domestic sugar production. This will facilitate the attainment of domestic sugar self-sufficiency, rural industrialization, social and food security.

TI  - The farmer's battlefield: traditional ecological knowledge and unexploded bombs in Cambodia
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - What role does traditional ecological knowledge play in the lives of smallholder farmers in post-conflict communities as they cope with the destructive impacts of war? In many cases, military weapons, such as unexploded bombs, are left behind in the surrounding landscape, forcing farmers to adapt their livelihood practices to the increased risk of death and injury. We analyze trends in the local production of knowledge in Ratanak Kiri province, Cambodia, an area heavily bombarded by the US Air Force during the Vietnam War. We argue that the system of traditional ecological knowledge has adapted to include basic information on bomb identification, location, and management strategies. This factual approach gives individuals the flexibility to generate their own views on whether they perceive unexploded ordnance as a violent hazard and/or an economic commodity. In a relatively short 50-year time period, the body of knowledge has been quickly accumulated and culturally transmitted to family and neighbors. Our findings suggest that traditional ecological knowledge should not be reduced to a static and ancient form of collective memory. We call for the expansion of the concept of traditional ecological knowledge to include short-term and dynamic processes of knowledge generation.

TI  - Households' livelihood strategies facing market uncertainties: How did Thai farmers adapt to a rubber price drop?
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Tree crop growers are particularly sensitive to commodity price fluctuations. Since 2012, rubber prices have been decreasing. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of how Thai family farms responded to that continuous decrease in rubber prices. The originality of this work was to combine a farming system approach for decision making with the sustainable rural livelihoods' framework for resource endowment and strategies to benefit from the complementarities of these two theoretical approaches. An existing database was used characterizing the rubber farms and farmers' practices in 2011 when the rubber price was at its maximum. A subsample of farmers was interviewed again in 2017 after six years of price decreases to characterize the new situation and to identify and explain the changes. Fifteen flexibility mechanisms to face the crisis were implemented at three different levels: rubber cropping system, farming system and activity system. Combinations of these mechanisms identified eight strategies of adaptation to the crisis, classified on the reversibility of the changes. Three major types of strategies were identified: (i) reversible adjustments at the level of activity system variables, (ii) mobilization of available production factors to be invested in an activity that allows, over a longer time perspective, compensation for the disturbances caused by the crisis. This type of adaptation was reversible, but its implementation expressed motivation in the medium and long terms; (iii) reallocation of the production factors already mobilized at the level of the rubber cropping system toward other activities, to compensate the disturbances caused by the crisis. This last type induced a deeper transformation in the distribution of the production factors in the activity system and was anchored in a long-term vision. The first type corresponded to a dynamics of disturbances absorption to maintain the smallholders' systems and overcome the crisis; the two other types corresponded to dynamics of compensation with more or less reversible changes. Overall, this study confirmed the capacity of adaptation of family agriculture when facing shocks. It also showed that the flexibility of these households relied greatly on rubber cropping systems through possible technical change and through the adaptation of the share-tapping labor contract. This highlighted the importance of considering farmers' practices (and changes of practices) to understand their strategies.

TI  - SOCIAL CAPITAL IN A RAINWATER-HARVESTING PROJECT IN RURAL SOUTH AFRICA
T2  - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
AB  - This paper examines social aspects within and amongst households in two selected villages in the Thaba Nchu area in the Free State Province, South Africa. In a semi-arid environment and low potential for dry croplands, techniques of rainwater harvesting were introduced to enable individual households to improve the level of their food production. This intervention could be seen from a purely biophysical and economic perspective, but the sociocultural domain is just as important for the successful outcome of the intervention. The assumption is that water utilisation and food production are socially embedded in the sense that individuals with different levels of support, are bound together in a situation of risk and uncertainty to collectively find ways to deal with scarcity in resources. The potential for internal conflict and consequent failure or disruption of development projects are real threats to the outcome of any intervention. The paper characterises selected aspects of social capital, namely social support, social networks and cohesion, which are regarded as important factors to consider in the planning and executing of interventions in the field of small-scale food production.

TI  - Informal lending amongst friends and relatives: Can microcredit compete in rural China?
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - This paper explores the relationship between informal and formal lending in China with consideration of how the strength of informal lending might affect microcredit. Lending relationships involving trust are investigated using original survey data from over 1500 farm households. Econometric results confirm a relationship between trust and informal lending, and mistrust and formal lending. With over 67% of farm households borrowing from friends and relatives the economic significance between this form of informal lending and borrowing from Rural Credit Cooperatives and Micro Finance Institutions cannot be overlooked.

TI  - Agricultural innovation and adaptation to climate change: empirical evidence from diverse agro-ecologies in South Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - While impacts of climate change on agricultural systems have been widely researched, there is still limited understanding of what agricultural innovations have evolved over time in response to both climatic and non-climatic drivers. Although there has been some progress in formulating national adaptation policies and strategic planning in different countries of South Asia, research to identify local-level adaptive strategies and practices is still limited. Through eight case studies and a survey of 300 households in 15 locations in India, Nepal and Bangladesh, this paper generates empirical evidence on emerging agricultural innovations in contrasting socio-economic, geographical and agro-ecological contexts. The study demonstrates that several farm practices (innovations) have emerged in response to multiple drivers over time, with various forms of institutional and policy support, including incentives to reduce risks in the adoption of innovative practice. It further shows that there is still limited attempt to systematically mainstream adaptation innovations into local, regional and national government structures, policies and planning processes. The paper shows that the process of farm-level adaptation through innovation adoption forms an important avenue for agricultural adaptation in South Asia. A key implication of this finding is that there is a need for stronger collaborations between research institutions, extension systems, civil society and the private sector actors to enhance emerging adaptive innovations at the farm level.

TI  - Inequities in access to food stamps and meal vouchers in Brazil: an analysis of the Brazilian Household Budgets Survey, 2008-2009
T2  - CADERNOS DE SAUDE PUBLICA
AB  - Food stamps and meal vouchers can determine workers' dietary choices. The study aimed to assess the coverage of these benefits in Brazil and their distribution according to the beneficiaries' socio-demographic and regional characteristics, using data from the Brazilian Household Budgets Survey, 2008-2009. Eligibility criteria were having an occupation and a private or government job, including domestic or temporary work in rural areas. Only 3.2% of eligible individuals reported receiving such benefits. Highest coverage rates were verified with the Southeast region, urban areas, male gender, employment in the private sector, and monthly earnings > five times the minimum wage. The mean monthly amount of such benefits was R$ 177.20 (US$ 100 at the 2009 exchange rate). After adjusting for other variables, the highest amounts were associated with male gender, higher salaries, the Northeast and Central regions, and employment in the public sector. This first analysis of the national coverage of food stamps and meal vouchers showed that a large share of Brazilian workers lack access or have unequal access to such benefits.

TI  - Endogenous social capital and self-rated health: Cross-sectional data from rural areas of Madagascar
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - The aim of this study is to analyse the pathways between income and self-rated health through the mediating role of social capital. Taking up recent criticisms on statistical approaches to social capital, we propose to endogenize this concept as an outcome of households' economic status and personal characteristics. In this way it becomes possible to analyse both the compositional effect of social capital and its mediating role in the income-health causal pattern. The originality of this work rests on the production of two kinds of variables of social capital: the probability a household gets involved in social activities according to its characteristics; and a residual variable of social capital that is not predicated by household characteristics. Based on cross-sectional data from five rural areas of Antsirabe (Madagsacar) in 2001, this work suggests that a high level of social capital-especially in collective actions and social networks-leads to better self-rated health.

TI  - The role of land- and water-use rights in smallholders' productive use of irrigation water in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS-AFJARE
AB  - This study aimed to analyse the extent to which land- and water-use rights enable/deter the productive use of irrigation water. Data was collected from 242 sampled smallholders in three study areas in KwaZulu-Natal. The findings indicate that the productive use of irrigation water is positively influenced by land- and water-use rights, with scheme committees being the first point of contact for smallholders when they need access to land and water. A provincial body of scheme committees is needed through which smallholders can capacitate each other in how they can improve access, appreciate the role of collective action and deal with challenges related to water, land and markets by applying their experiences. This body can be represented in policy formulation and aid in policy implementation. This paper shows that land and water policy alone cannot improve smallholder productivity, and that enhancing the productive use of irrigation water requires a holistic approach that considers the accessibility of input and output markets.

TI  - Land leasing and sharecropping in Brazil: Determinants, modus operandi and future perspectives
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Ceding use of land can have a positive impact on the unequal allocation of resources in rural areas. In Brazil, although the practice is nationwide, leasing and sharecropping are not widely employed. The objective of this article is to describe how these contracts work in the country, using 2006 Census Data. It was noticed that, on the one hand, the more advantageous contracts involve producers with higher levels of income and qualification, located mainly in the Southeast, South and Midwest. On the other hand, there is an expressive number of poor, small producers in the Northeast whose productive activity barely provides subsistence for the family. It is unlikely that these contracts will be a viable option to access land while there is still instability surrounding property (better definition of property rights) and the employment of incentives for the beneficiaries themselves.

TI  - Rural land rights reform and agro-environmental sustainability: Empirical evidence from China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The landscape of China's rural land market has been changed by several significant land right reforms since the 1970s. It is always of great interest to both the government and the public to gauge the effectiveness of these reforms. We address this question by investigating the impact of a recent land use right reform, namely, the `Three Rights Separation Policy', on agro-environmental sustainability. By separating land management right from land contracted management right, this new reform is believed to be a powerful tool to encourage land transfer, optimize land resource allocation, and increase the economy of scale in the agriculture sector. Using a PSM-DID model applied to panel data for the years 2008 and 2014, our study demonstrates that the new policy also increases the use of organic fertilizers by 48.641 kg/mu in total, which is a very important step to ensure agro-environmental sustainability in China. The new policy is more effective in encouraging the application of organic fertilizer when the issuing of land certificates is enforced and administrative barriers to land right transfers are removed. The findings add value to the growing literature on rural land right reforms in China and may also have significant implications in developing countries with similar rural land tenure systems and underdeveloped land and labor markets.

TI  - Diffusion and adoption of Integrated Striga Management (ISM) technologies among smallholder maize farmers in rural northern Nigeria
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - This study estimated the actual and potential adoption rates of Integrated Striga Management (ISM) technologies, among smallholder maize farmers in rural northern Nigeria, using the treatment effect framework. The results revealed a significant overall adoption rate of 55% of the targeted population while 83.5% of the farmers were exposed to the ISM practices. With such an incomplete diffusion of the ISM technologies, the study estimated potential adoption rate to be 68.2%, while the actual adoption (JEA) rate was estimated to be 58.3% resulting in an adoption gap of 9.9% due to incomplete diffusion/exposure. In addition, diffusion and adoption of ISM technologies were found to be influenced by factors such as famer's years of farming experience, total farm size under maize cultivation, cooperative society's membership, attendance of farm workshop/seminars, on-farm trials and field days among others. Policy implications for increase productivity and food security through ISM technology diffusion and adoption were discussed.

TI  - Cotton production by family farms in China: Strengths and weaknesses of its integration into a market economy
T2  - CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB  - China is not only the leading cotton producer worldwide but has become a structural importer. The wide-scale adoption of genetically modified cotton (GMC) has led some observers, to assume that Chinese production will increase Substantially, thereby limiting its demand from structural cotton-exporting Countries. During negotiations for the WTO Doha Round, fear of China's power in the cotton sector has been transformed into criticism of what is called its unfair Subsidy policy. Both of these views are debatable and suffer from a lack of insight about the development of cotton production in China. This paper attempts to document the debate and to fill that gap. Cotton production in China is located is three main regions, along the Yellow River Valley, the Yangtze River Valley and in the Xinjiang Uigur Autonomous Region, where cotton production only began in the 1970s. This production cannot be considered separately from Chinese agriculture in general, Which is currently undergoing great changes. Despite high yields, agricultural activities no longer ensure sufficient income to farmers. Off-farm activities keep the revenue of rural households from falling further behind that of urban households, but agriculture does not appear to attract the workers of rural areas, and this depopulation raises questions about the fare of farming in the years to come. Its shift towards provinces located further from the economically dynamic coastal areas depends upon the implementation of recent policies intended to correct the income disparities from which rural areas suffer. Cotton is still produced according to the high input/high output approach associated with policies to protect farmers against climatic hazards and economic risks, through input Subsidies and purchase price guarantee. Although China stopped providing direct subsidies to cotton growers when it joined the WTO, intensification of production continues, and the use of GMC call be regarded as a further stage of this intensification process. This relation between past policy and GMC use must be considered before extrapolating Chinese achievements with the latter to other developing countries. The lack of collective action by farmers impedes the Success of the intensification process, makes cotton farming less profitable, and may endanger the sustainable use of GMC by causing undesirable shifts of the cotton pest complex. It is doubtful that China can reverse its importing position in the cotton world market in the Short run. While this may reassure cotton-exploring countries, it Must not prevent them from taking measures to increase their competitiveness through improved productivity.

TI  - Influence of Natural Disaster Shock and Collective Action on Farmland Transferees' No-Tillage Technology Adoption in China
T2  - LAND
AB  - Climate change in natural disasters such as droughts and floods has caused people to adopt, extend, and diffuse adaptive agricultural technologies. Meanwhile, the development of the farmland leasing market has pushed agricultural laborers to migrate from rural to urban areas, resulting in less participation in collective action. It is generally believed that no-tillage technology lessens the agricultural production risks instigated by climate change and natural disasters. However, previous literature has given little attention to this phenomenon, especially in the context of China. So, to fill this gap, the current study explores the influence of natural disaster shock and collective action on farmland transferees' no-tillage technology adoption using the data of 621 farmland transferees from Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces, China. By using Heckman's two-stage and moderating-effect models, the findings initially reveal that in the sample, 249 farmland transferees adopt no-tillage technology, accounting for 40.10% of farmland transferees. The farmland area in which no-tillage technology is adopted accounts for 23.90% of the total farmland area. Natural disaster shock exerts a positive and significant influence on transferees' no-tillage technology adoption, i.e., if the intensity of natural disaster shock increases by one unit, the adoption rate and adoption degree will increase by 24.9% and 9.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, collective action also positively and significantly impacts transferees' no-tillage technology adoption. If the number of transferees participating in collective action increases by one unit, the adoption rate and degree will increase by 13.3% and 6.5%, respectively. Further, it is found that collective action positively moderates the relationship between natural disaster shock and the adoption of no-tillage technology by farmland transferees. Additionally, educational level, agricultural income, farmland area, etc., are also found to influence transferees' no-tillage technology adoption significantly. Moreover, based on gender and organizational participation differences, the findings reveal that the effects of natural disaster shock and collective action are heterogeneous. The results propose that policymakers should take countermeasures such as providing training in no-tillage skills, raising no-tillage subsidy standards, and guiding long-term farmland transference.

TI  - Grain subsidy, off-farm labor supply and farmland leasing: Evidence from China
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - This study investigates the impact of direct grain subsidy and off-farm labor supply on farmland leasing options in China, using multinomial logit and farm household-level data. Results show that the grain subsidy has a significant and positive effect on both leasing out and leasing in farmland in rural China. Rural households with an increased share of full-time off-farm workers are more likely to lease out farmland and less likely to lease it in. Older operators and households with less educational attainment are less likely to lease in farmland. Large farms are likely to both lease out and lease in farmland. Finally, the Land Shareholding Cooperative System (LSCS) plays an important role in China's farmland leasing market.

TI  - Bonded Labour or What Else? A Case Study in Tamil Nadu, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Debt bondage is the focus of an international struggle for its abolition. Yet the literature finds that, in certain circumstances, the credit-for-work contracts behind debt bondage are mutually beneficial to both employer and employee. We take on an empirical study in south India to assess whether choosing credit, which can raise a risk of dependence on the lender and therefore a risk of debt bondage, is a choice made to prevent other forms of risk, especially financial risk and the risk of violence. We find this to be the case in our study. From a policy point of view, the abolition of debt bondage in these circumstances could drive up the very same forms of risk against which households seek to guard. In this context, providing alternatives employment solutions to rural workers is a priority. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Son preference, children's gender and parents' time allocation: evidence from China
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - This article investigates the effect of children's gender on parents' time allocation in developing countries due to the long-existing tradition of son preference. A collective model generates predictions concerning the impact of the birth of sons on family behaviour when son preference is treated as a premium in the father's utility function. Using data from China, I show that, with more sons instead of daughters, the time spent by both men and women on housework rises, while men have to increase their work time in the labour market and women can reduce theirs. The results are consistent with theoretical predictions and are robust for use in further tests. For the possible endogeneity of children's gender, I use the law forbidding the use of ultrasound-B to reveal the gender of a foetus as instrumental variables as the identification strategy.

TI  - How feminization of forest management drives households' adoption of technologies: Evidence from non-timber forest products operations in China
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The trend of feminization in forest management has become more prevalent in developing countries due to a growing out-migration of rural male laborers for off-farm work. Meanwhile, technological progress can play a major role in mitigating the labor shortage and improving the outputs of forest production. It is thus important to understand how the feminization has affected rural household's decision on the adoption of labor-intensive technologies (LITs) or labor-saving technologies (LSTs). Based on the induced innovation theory and data from 408 households engaged in non-timber forest products (NTFPs) operations in 13 counties of Zhejiang Province, multiple versions of IV-probit models were used to address that question. Our findings reveal that rural households with higher rates of feminization of forest management were more inclined to adopt LSTs and had a low probability of adopting LITs. We recommend to provide more subsidies for LSTs extension, give left-behind female laborers with more targeted trainings, and encourage private enterprises to undertake more active technical services and more physically-demanding operations on a contractual basis.

TI  - A configuration study on rural residents' willingness to participate in improving the rural living environment in less-developed areas-Evidence from six provinces of western China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Maintaining the sustained improvement of human living environments in rural areas while improving habitats poses a substantial challenge. While promoting participation by rural residents is key to achieving the improvement of rural living environments, existing studies have mostly focused on the "net effect " single factors have on their participation. However, few studies have considered the combined effects of multiple characteristics in complex contexts. In this study, a revised model of planned behavior is constructed, based on configuration theory; the histories of pathways that influence rural households' willingness to participate in improving rural living environments are also explored. The perspective of concurrent causality is adopted, and this study examines whether a "mutual substitution effect " exists between the antecedent conditions in different paths. A questionnaire survey was conducted in six provinces (including autonomous regions) in less-developed areas of China. Six configuration paths of rural residents' higher willingness to participate in the improvement of rural living environments were obtained using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. The results show that: 1) In the path of high willingness to participate, the behavioral attitudes characterized by the "trustworthiness of village leaders " and "group identity " play the central role. "Social capital " and the "trustworthiness of village leaders " have a mutual substitution effect. 2) When using positive behavioral attitude evaluation as a core condition, "educational level " and "environmental awareness " have a mutual substitution effect. "Household income level ", as the marginal condition, has a mutual substitution effect with "environmentally friendly habits ". Therefore, to increase rural residents' willingness to participate in improving rural living environments in less-developed areas, the level of the "trustworthiness of village leaders " and "group identity " should be raised. In addition, depending on the "mutual substitution effect " between different conditions, to achieve the same improvement in rural areas with a low level of "social capital ", the focus should be on improving the "trustworthiness of village leaders ". For rural areas with a slight difference in "household income level ", the focus should be on promoting the formation of "environmentally friendly habits " among rural residents.

TI  - Enhancing farmers' agency in the global crop commons through use of biocultural community protocols
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - Crop genetic resources constitute a 'new' global commons, characterized by multiple layers of activities of farmers, genebanks, public and private research and development organizations, and regulatory agencies operating from local to global levels. This paper presents sui generis biocultural community protocols that were developed by four communities in Benin and Madagascar to improve their ability to contribute to, and benefit from, the crop commons. The communities were motivated in part by the fact that their national governments' had recently ratified the Plant Treaty and the Nagoya Protocol, which make commitments to promoting the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities and farmers, without being prescriptive as to how Contracting Parties should implement those commitments. The communities identified the protocols as useful means to advance their interests and/or rights under both the Plant Treaty and the Nagoya Protocol to be recognized as managers of local socio-ecological systems, to access genetic resources from outside the communities, and to control others' access to resources managed by the community.

TI  - Trends and determinants of catastrophic health expenditure in China 2010-2018: a national panel data analysis
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - BackgroundCatastrophic health expenditures (CHE) are out-of-pocket payments (OOP) that exceed a predefined percentage or threshold of a household's resources, usually 40%, that can push households into poverty in China. We analyzed the trends in the incidence and intensity, and explored the determinants, of CHE, and proposed policy recommendation to address CHE.MethodsA unique 5-year national urban-rural panel database was constructed from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) surveys. CHE incidence was measured by calculating headcount (percentage of households incurring CHE to the total household sample) and intensity was measured by overshoot (degree by which an average out of pocket health expenditure exceeds the threshold of the total sample). A linear probability model was employed to assess the trend in the net effect of the determinants of CHE incidence and a random effect logit model was used to analyse the role of the characteristics of the household head, the household and household health utilization on CHE incidence.ResultsCHE determinants vary across time and geographical location. From 2010 to 2018, the total, urban and rural CHE incidence all showed a decreasing tend, falling from 14.7 to 8.7% for total households, 12.5-6.6% in urban and 16.8-10.9% in rural areas. CHE intensity decreased in rural (24.50-20.51%) and urban (22.31-19.57%) areas and for all households (23.61-20.15%). Inpatient services were the most important determinant of the incidence of CHE. For urban households, the random effect logit model identified household head (age, education, self-rated health); household characteristics (members 65+years, chronic diseases, family size and income status); and healthcare utilization (inpatient and outpatient usage) as determinants of CHE. For rural areas, the same variables were significant with the addition of household head's sex and health insurance.ConclusionsThe incidence and intensity of CHE in China displayed a downward trend, but was higher in rural than urban areas. Costs of inpatient service usage should be a key intervention strategy to address CHE. The policy implications include improving the economic level of poor households, reforming health insurance and reinforcing pre-payment hospital insurance methods.

TI  - Determinants of the competitiveness of smallholder African indigenous vegetable farmers in high-value agro-food chains in Kenya: A multivariate probit regression analysis
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD ECONOMICS
AB  - Smallholder farmers are excluded from efficient and effective participation in high-value agro-food market chains due to major competitiveness constraints and several market failures along these chains. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the competitiveness of smallholder farmers in a more coordinated and sustainable way that promote their effective and efficient participation in high-value agro-food market chains. In particular, the study aims at determining the main role of households' capitals, institutional, and access-related factors in conditioning the decision of smallholder farmers of African indigenous vegetables (AIVs) to access pillars of competitiveness in high-value market chains (HVMCs). For this purpose, a unique household-level data from a total of 1232 rural and peri-urban AIV-producing households were surveyed, and the data obtained were analysed by using a multivariate probit model.The results suggest that about two thirds of smallholder AIV farmers had access to at least one pillar of competitiveness in HVMCs. The model results show the presence of inter-dependency of household level decisions to access multiple pillars of competitiveness in HVMCs. Furthermore, the results also reveal that coping with shocks, coupled with access to information on market prices and warnings of unexpected events, contract farming, certification and modern irrigation technologies are the main conditioning factors to the access of the pillars of competitiveness by smallholder farmers.The promotion and implementation of a well-founded mobile phone-based information access platforms, as well as effective and efficient livelihood strategies that support smallholder farmers to access pillars of competitiveness, is of critical importance towards overcoming the major competitiveness constraints along high-value agro-food chains.

TI  - Management adaptation to flood in Guangdong Province in China: Do property rights Matter?
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Improving land rights in China is often considered as an important factor that facilitates farmers' investments in agriculture. However, whether securing land rights is important for farmers' adaptation to changing climate or not has not been addressed in the literature, particularly with respect to management decisions. This paper examines the relationship between land tenure types and farmer adaptation through management decisions in response to extreme weather events in Guangdong Province in China. Based on a household survey of rice farmers, our results show that compared to a normal year with minor weather events farmers with contracted land are more likely to implement adaptation measures in response to extreme weather events than those who have rented their land from the collective and from other farmers. The results suggest that farmers' adaptive behaviour in response to extreme weather events is significantly different from their day-to-day adaptation to ongoing changes in climate. Farmers' adaptive capacity is also positively influenced by age, the public provision of information, by the presence of social capital, and by plot quality. The results of this study highlight the importance of properly defined land rights for the likelihood of adaptation, and thereby increasing agricultural productivity and ensuring food security in the context of a changing climate.

TI  - A cultural theory of drinking water risks, values and institutional change
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Global progress towards the goal of universal, safely managed drinking water services will be shaped by the dynamic relationship between water risks, values and institutions. We apply Mary Douglas' cultural theory to rural waterpoint management and discuss its operationalisation in pluralist arrangements through networking different management cultures at scale. The theory is tested in coastal Kenya, an area that typifies the challenges faced across Africa in providing rural communities with safely managed water. Drawing on findings from a longitudinal study of 3500 households, we examine how different management cultures face and manage operational, financial, institutional and environmental risks. This paper makes the case for cooperative solutions across systems where current policy effectively separates communities from the state or markets. The contribution of this research is both a theoretical and empirical case to consider pluralist institutional arrangements that enable risks and responsibilities to be re-conceptualised and re-allocated between the state, market and communities to create value for rural water users.

TI  - Gendered livelihoods and the politics of socio-environmental identity: women's participation in conservation projects in Calakmul, Mexico
T2  - GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE
AB  - A livelihoods approach positions individuals, situated within households, as active agents within processes occurring at various scales. Environmental conservation efforts represent one such process with direct implications for local sustainable livelihoods and the gendered nature of livelihood strategies. In this article, I examine collective processes of socio-environmental identity construction as gendered sustainable livelihood strategies, articulated in and through the activities of women's agricultural organizations in communities bordering the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in rural southern Mexico. I present group histories and visual evidence from group activities adapted from participatory rural appraisal (PRA) methodology - to highlight two important concepts. These are: (1) that gendered livelihood strategies are outcomes of negotiations within households and communities, in response to specific gendered opportunities and constraints; and (2) that gendered livelihood strategies consist of linked material and ideological aspects.

TI  - The Green Belt Initiative, Politics and Sugar Production in Malawi
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - This paper critically examines underlying political economy dynamics of the expansion of sugar cultivation in Malawi within the framework of the Green Belt Initiative (GBI). This is being promoted in the context of a protracted legislative impasse in land reform efforts, targeting primarily land that belongs to smallholder farmers. The paper argues that the promises of employment, technology transfer and infrastructure development, as outlined in the GBI concept paper and touted in the outgrower sugar cane project, remain rhetorical. Communities in the investment sites are experiencing a destabilisation of social relations, precipitated by persistent violent confrontations with a coalition of elites. Corporate and elite interests have coalesced to press on with the GBI experiment, even though the welfare of smallholders is being undermined, and despite the growing resistance through both legal and extra-legal means. This political economy of sugar must be understood in relation to Malawi's elite politics, a pattern that has persisted across successive regimes.

TI  - The Bengal Water Machine: Quantified freshwater capture in Bangladesh
T2  - SCIENCE
AB  - Global food security depends on the sustainability of irrigated agriculture. Rising groundwater withdrawals from seasonally humid, alluvial plains across tropical Asia have enabled dry-season rice cultivation. This groundwater pumpage increases available subsurface storage that under favorable conditions amplifies groundwater replenishment during the subsequent monsoon. We empirically quantified this nature-based solution to seasonal freshwater storage capture described as the "Bengal Water Machine," revealing its potential and limitations. On the basis of a million piezometric observations from 465 monitoring wells, we show that the collective operation of similar to 16 million smallholder farmers in the Bengal Basin of Bangladesh from 1988 to 2018 has induced cumulative freshwater capture that volumetrically (75 to 90 cubic kilometers) is equivalent to twice the reservoir capacity of the Three Gorges Dam.

TI  - Farmers' knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards timber out-grower schemes in selected districts of Malawi
T2  - SOUTHERN FORESTS
AB  - Timber out-grower schemes have proved to be one of the most profitable enterprises for rural households. No wonder, several analysts and researchers regard them as an alternative model to avoid problems of displacement and create 'win-win' outcomes for both rural communities and private investors in forestry. However, understanding farmers' knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards tree out-grower schemes plays a key role in farmers' adoption of the interventions. This study examined these farmers' attributes towards out-grower schemes in selected districts of Malawi. Data were collected from 300 farmers who were randomly selected between September and October 2017 through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. The results revealed that 82% of the respondents participated in timber out-grower schemes, piloted by WVI and ICRAF. Based on a median score of 4.75 (IQR 4-5), respondents were strongly agreed on their knowledge on timber out-grower schemes as a basis for adopting the intervention. Using the cumulative Cube-root frequency method of stratification, the results revealed that more than half (51%) of the respondents belonged to the high category, and thus had high knowledge of timber out-grower schemes, whereas 32% and 17% had very high and medium levels of knowledge, respectively. The study also revealed that 79.3% of the respondents had a positive attitude towards out-grower schemes. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive, significant relationship between marital status (r = 0.081), household size (r = 0.062), education (r = 0.051) and knowledge of the respondents on timber out-grower schemes. A significant positive relationship was also observed between marital status (r = 0.156), household size (0.178), education (0.002), ethnic group (0.151) and attitudes of the respondents towards timber out-grower schemes. However, a negative relationship between knowledge and attitude was revealed (r = -0.534). The study therefore concludes that socio-economic factors, such as gender, education, ethnic group and household size, should be considered in upscaling timber out-grower schemes in Malawi.

TI  - The expansion of public health insurance and the demand for private health insurance in rural China
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - This paper examines the impact of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) on private health insurance purchasing decisions in rural China, using longitudinal data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS, 2000-2006). A Difference-in-difference (DID) approach is employed to estimate NCMS effects. The overall effects of NCMS were modest, but differed for adults and children. We find that adults were 2.1% more likely to purchase private health insurance when NCMS became available. NCMS had a larger positive effect on adult private coverage in higher income groups and in communities with a preexisting health care financing system, known as the Cooperative Medical Scheme (CMS). We also find evidence suggesting that NCMS crowded out child private health insurance, especially in lower income groups. However, this finding is not robust to controlling for other covariates including household characteristics and availability of private insurance in the community. For both adults and children, risk preferences and socio-economic status, including income and education, are important predictors of private insurance take-up. We find no evidence for adverse selection in the demand for private health insurance. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Does Information Lead to More Active Citizenship? Evidence from an Education Intervention in Rural Kenya
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We study a randomized educational intervention in 550 households in 26 matched villages in two Kenyan districts. The intervention provided parents with information about their children's performance on literacy and numeracy tests, and materials about how to become more involved in improving their children's learning. We find the provision of such information had no discernible impact on either private or collective action. In discussing these findings, we articulate a framework linking information provision to changes in citizens' behavior, and assess the present intervention at each step. Future research on information provision should pay greater attention to this framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The extent of livelihood diversification on the determinants of livelihood diversification in Assosa Wereda, Western Ethiopia
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
AB  - This study was conducted to examine the determinants of diversification of livelihoods to investigate the degree of diversification of households' livelihoods in Assosa wereda, Benshangul Gumuz Regional State, in western Ethiopia. A total of 320 sample rural households were selected by using systematic sampling technique from four kebeles. Both qualitative and quantitative data collected through a structured questionnaire, key informant interview, focus group discussions and observation. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistical tools, the multinomial logit regression model, and Simpson Diversification Index. The result of the study show, of the 14 determinants of diversification of livelihoods identified: level of education, dependency ratio, access to irrigation, and household urban linkage were significant predictors of diversification of livelihoods. Whereas household age and sex, road distance, credit access, and household media access were insignificant predictors of diversification of livelihoods. Meanwhile, land hold size, livestock holding size in Tropical Livestock Unit, extension contact, cooperative member and total household income couldn't have any association with household diversification of livelihoods in real conditions on the ground. Ultimately, the Simpson Diversity Index result showed that there was no diversification rather than "specialization" in livelihood. The study therefore urges more diversification opportunities in poverty alleviation and development.

TI  - How does the New Cooperative Medical Scheme influence health service utilization? A study in two provinces in rural China
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Many countries are developing health financing mechanisms to pursue the goal of universal coverage. In China, a rural health insurance system entitled New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) is being developed since 2003. Although there is concern about whether the NCMS will influence the serious situation of inequity in health service utilization in rural China, there is only limited evidence available. This paper aims to assess the utilisation of outpatient and inpatient services among different income groups and provinces under NCMS in rural China.
   Methods: Using multistage sampling processes, a cross-sectional household survey including 6,147 rural households and 22,636 individuals, was conducted in six counties in Shandong and Ningxia Provinces, China. Chi-square test, Poisson regression and log-linear regression were applied to analyze the association between NCMS and the utilization of outpatient and inpatient services and the length of stay for inpatients. Qualitative methods including individual interview and focus group discussion were applied to explain and complement the findings from the household survey.
   Results: NCMS coverage was 95.9% in Shandong and 88.0% in Ningxia in 2006. NCMS membership had no significant association with outpatient service utilization regardless of income level and location.
   Inpatient service utilization has increased for the high income group under NCMS, but for the middle and low income, the change was not significant. Compared with non-members, NCMS members from Ningxia used inpatient services more frequently, while members from Shandong had a longer stay in hospital.
   High medical expenditure, low reimbursement rate and difference in NCMS policy design between regions were identified as the main reasons for the differences in health service utilization.
   Conclusions: Outpatient service utilization has not significantly changed under NCMS. Although utilization of inpatient service in general has increased under NCMS, people with high income tend to benefit more than the low income group. While providing financial protection against catastrophic medical expenditure is the principal focus of NCMS, this study recommends that outpatient services should be incorporated in future NCMS policy development. NCMS policy should also be more equity oriented to achieve its policy goal.

TI  - Role of Access to Credit in Rice Production in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Case of Mwea Irrigation Scheme in Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES
AB  - This study explores the role of access to credit in improving rice production in Sub-Saharan Africa using the case of rice farmers in the large-scale Mwea irrigation scheme in Kenya. Using household level survey data, we find that the use of fertiliser and paddy yield per hectare are not significantly different among borrowers from the cooperative society, borrowers from rice traders and non-borrowers. However, borrowers from rice traders receive lower incomes and profits compared with non-borrowers largely due to the higher interest charged. Considering that such farmers who borrow from rice traders are generally poorer in financial, physical, and human capital and would have even made lower income and profit without rice trader credit, we suggest policies to facilitate further development of credit markets for both efficiency and equity of rice production in Mwea.

TI  - Impact of alternative reimbursement strategies in the new cooperative medical scheme on caesarean delivery rates: a mixed-method study in rural China
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: The rate of caesarean delivery (CD) in rural China has been rapidly increasing in recent decades. Due to the exorbitant costs associated with CD, paying for this expensive procedure is often a great challenge for the majority of rural families. Since 2003, the Chinese government has re-established the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), aimed to improve the access of essential healthcare to rural residents and reduce financial burden owing to high out of pocket payments. This paper seeks to test the hypothesis that NCMS may provide service users and providers with financial incentives to select CD. It also assesses the effect of different health insurance reimbursement strategies of NCMS on CD rates in rural China.
   Methods: Mixed quantitative and qualitative methods were adopted for data collection. Two cross-sectional household surveys were conducted with women having babies delivered in 2006 and 2009; 2326 and 1515 women, respectively, from the study sites were interviewed using structured questionnaires, to collect demographic and socio-economic data, maternal and child care characteristics and health-related expenditures. Focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth key informant interviews (KIIs) were undertaken with policy makers, health managers, providers and mothers to understand their perceptions of the influence of NCMS on the choices of delivery mode.
   Results: The CD rates in the two study counties were 46.0 percent and 64.7 percent in 2006, increasing to 63.6 percent and 82.1 percent, respectively, in 2009. The study found that decisions on the selection of CD largely came from the pregnant women. Logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for socio-economic, maternal and fetal characteristics, did not indicate a significant effect of either proportional reimbursement or fixed amount reimbursement on the choice of CD for both study years. Interviews with stakeholders reflected that different reimbursable rates for CD and vaginal deliveries did not have a significant effect on controlling the rising CD rate in the study countries.
   Conclusion: NCMS reimbursement strategies adopted in the study counties of China did not have a significant effect on the selection of CD for baby deliveries. The rapid rise of the CD rates of rural China has remained a serious issue. Other effective measures, such as health education to increase awareness of mothers' knowledge, and improving training of health staff in evidence-based delivery care, maybe could do more to promote rational baby delivery in rural China.

TI  - Violence against wives, sexual risk and sexually transmitted infection among Bangladeshi men
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
AB  - Objective: To assess the relationship between men's reported violence against wives and their sexual risk behaviours and sexual health.
   Design, setting and participants: Cross-sectional analyses of a survey of a nationally representative household-based sample of married men in Bangladesh ( n = 3096).
   Main outcome measure( s): Physical and sexual violence against wives during the previous 12 months was assessed and examined for relations to men's extramarital sexual behaviours and sexually transmitted infection ( STI) symptoms or diagnosis during this same period, as well as to men's disclosure of such infection to wives and condom use while infected.
   Results: More than 1 in 3 ( 36.84%) married Bangladeshi men reported physically and/or sexually abusing their wives in the past year. Men perpetrating such violence were more likely to report both premarital and extramarital sex partners ( OR(adj)s 1.80-3.45; 95% CI 1.20 to 8.23); those reporting physical violence were more likely to report STI symptoms or diagnosis in the past year ( OR(adj)s 1.68 - 2.52; 95% CI 1.24 to 3.73). Men perpetrating physical violence and contracting an STI were somewhat more likely to fail to disclose infection status to wives ( ORadj 1.58; 95% CI 0.93 to 2.70) than infected men not reporting such abuse.
   Conclusions: Violence against wives is common among Bangladeshi men. Men who perpetrate such abuse represent increased risk regarding their wives' sexual health because they are more likely to both participate in extramarital sexual behaviour and contract an STI compared with non-abusive husbands. Given the growing epidemic of HIV infection among monogamous South Asian women based on intercourse with infected non-monogamous husbands, research and intervention regarding men's violence in marriage and implications of such behaviour for women's sexual health should be prioritised.

TI  - Adoption and continued use of improved maize seeds: Case study of Central Ethiopia
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - The literature on agricultural technology is limited on the issue of the continued use of an agricultural technology after it is adopted. This paper analyzes the factors that explain adoption as well as continued use of improved maize seeds in one of the high potential maize growing areas in central Ethiopia. Using a bivariate probit with sample selection model approach, the study provides insights into the key factors associated with adoption of improved maize seed and its continued use. The result revealed that human capital (adult workers, off-farm work and experience in hiring labor), asset endowment (size of land owned), institutional and policy variables (access to credit, membership in cooperatives) all strongly influence farmers' decisions to adopt improved maize varieties, while continuous use of the seed is influenced by the proportion of farmland allocated to maize, literacy of the household head, involvement in off-farm work, visits by extension agents, farmers' experience, household land size, and fertilizer usage. Accordingly, policies and interventions that are informed about such factors are required to accelerate adoption and continued use of improved maize seeds in order to increase farm yields and remedy shortage of food and fight food poverty and insecurity more effectively and more sustainably.

TI  - Willingness to Pay for Livestock Husbandry Insurance: An Empirical Analysis of Grassland Farms in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Livestock husbandry insurance (LHI) is increasingly gaining acceptance in developing countries, relative to its efficacy in mitigating the covariate risks faced by households in vulnerable agrarian communities. However, this risk-mitigating tool has received little research attention in the context of Chinese herders. The current study focused on the status, and determinants of herders' willingness to purchase LHI. We used a contingent valuation approach to collect data from 450 households across three grassland types in Inner Mongolia. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression models were used to analyze the collected data. We show that herders' level of awareness and acceptance of LHI are below expectations. Our results further indicated that herders with higher education level, livestock number, risk perception level, awareness, and contracted grassland area are more likely to purchase LHI. Policymakers and insurers should design programs that will educate herders on LHI while taking cognizance of other critical factors that influence households to purchase insurance. This will go a long way in scaling-up the attractiveness of LHI to herders and the agrarian community at large.

TI  - Exploring the role of nested institutions in community-based tourism development: Two case studies from China's Tibetan pastoral region
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
AB  - Community-based tourism is key to rural sustainable development. However, information remains inadequate on how natural resource management institutions restructure community social capital and property rights regimes while developing community cooperation and tourism participation within evolving rural socio-economic systems. This study investigates two rural villages, one under a household-based rangeland transfer system and the other under a community cooperative institution, to quantitatively assess how each mediates rights-based, structure-based, and network-based access mechanisms influencing community cooperation and tourism outcomes. The community cooperative institution facilitated higher rights-based and network-based access to tourism resources and markets for all community members, improving tourism participation and the equitable distribution of tourism benefits. This is because it uses hybrid and nested property rights provisions and social capital operating at different scales to protect individual rights and the balance of power. These practices restore social reciprocity, community redistribution, and market networks in building community cooperation, which better responds to the changing features of the rural socio-economic system. Therefore, social capital and property rights regimes are components of a nested community institution used to restructure social networks, rights, and entitlements. By these means, rural communities can devise different cooperative scales to govern their access to tourism resources and markets.

TI  - Unveiling Cacao Agroforestry Sustainability through the Socio-Ecological Systems Diagnostic Framework: The Case of Four Amazonian Rural Communities in Ecuador
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Cacao cultivation is rapidly increasing in Latin America under the influence of public policies and external markets. In Ecuador, the cultivated surface of high quality cacao trees has doubled in the last 50 years, creating great expectations in neighboring countries. Here, we investigated the social-ecological sustainability of cacao-based agroforestry systems in four rural Amazonian highlands communities in eastern Ecuador, close to the region where cacao was once domesticated. Kichwa- and Shuar-speaking groups were interviewed by adapting Ostrom's institutional diagnostic framework for social-ecological systems. Through a set of specifically created indicator variables, we identified key interactions and outcomes to understand the fragility and the sustainability of those communities. The studied communities were fairly young, with land rights secured less than 30 years ago in most cases. Per-family surfaces were very restricted (typically one hectare) and plots were divided between cash producing crops and their own home food. The small production per household goes through a precarious commercialization by both intermediaries and cooperatives, making the cacao bean production merely sufficient for pocket money. Ties with specialist producers in one community close to the capital has promoted the use of native cacao lines. Elsewhere, improved varieties of high productivity are planted along native trees being commercialized indistinctly. The continuity of these communities currently depend on a reorganization of their demography with parts of the population working elsewhere, as cacao bean production alone will continue to be insufficient, and will compete with their food self-sufficiency.

TI  - Can Protected Area Have Positive Effects on Community Livelihood?-Evidence from Wuyi Mountain National Nature Reserve, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST ECONOMICS
AB  - Despite an extensive literature indicating that protected areas (PA) affect negatively local people's livelihood and can even exacerbate local poverty, a few studies found that PA can have positive effects on the local economy by promoting eco-tourism. In this study, we conducted a three-period survey of 170 rural households in Wuyi Mountain National Nature Reserve (WNR) in northern Fujian province of China during 2010-2014. We used robust random effect models to examine the effects of PA on local livelihood. A novel finding is that households (HHs) within WNR have much higher total income and total income per capita than HHs nearby WNR. HHs within WNR have a simple livelihood strategy with an extremely high dependence on the black tea industry, and HHs nearby WNR have diversified livelihood strategy with an increasing dependence on the black tea industry. Our results show that HH income is positively related to the age and education of the HH head. Membership of a large clan and financial and technical assistance can contribute to increasing HH income. HHs that engage only in farming as well as those that are a member of farm cooperative are likely to have lower income. The results also indicate a positive spill-over effect of communities within WNR on communities nearby WNR. We argue that communities within WNR should diversify their livelihood strategy to control risk, and communities nearby WNR should explore their comparative advantages rather than following the example of communities within WNR to expand black tea production.

TI  - Sugar, People and Politics in Zimbabwe's Lowveld
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - The expansion of outgrower areas linked to large lowveld sugar estates has been an important component of Zimbabwe's land reform since 2000. This has involved the transfer of nearly 16,000 ha to over 800 resettlement farmers on irrigated A2' plots of around 20 ha each. These farmers now produce around a quarter of the sugar output linked to the Triangle and Hippo Valley mills. Tongaat Hulett, a large South African conglomerate, is the dominant shareholder in Zimbabwe's sugar industry, and its Zimbabwe operation represents a crucial part of the overall multi-million-dollar business. The new outgrowers are a mix of former civil servants, sugar industry professionals and business people, with some politicians and security service personnel also with land. Through a detailed analysis over 12 years of the changing fortunes of a group of new outgrowers linked to Hippo Valley estate, the paper explores the patterns of production, employment and wider livelihood contexts of outgrowers and their workers. In particular the paper examines the tensions and conflicts that have arisen, particularly between the new outgrowers and the estate. The paper in turn explores the implications for sugar politics in Zimbabwe's Lowveld. The new outgrowers were drawn from a range of previous occupations and, compared to land reform beneficiaries in nearby dryland smallholder areas, were richer, better educated and more well-connected politically. The paper asks how this new group negotiated a relationship with a large-scale South African capitalist enterprise, and with what outcomes. More broadly, the paper examines how outgrowers, the state and capital brokered a politically and economically acceptable post-land reform deal, suiting all parties. Based on the longitudinal case study insights, the paper concludes with an assessment of whether Zimbabwe's very particular sugar outgrower model of land reform will work, and if it does, for whom.

TI  - Decentralizing conservation and diversifying livelihoods within Kanchenjunga Conservation Area, Nepal
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - To alleviate poverty and enhance conservation in resource dependent communities, managers must identify existing livelihood strategies and the associated factors that impede household access to livelihood assets. Researchers increasingly advocate reallocating management power from exclusionary central institutions to a decentralized system of management based on local and inclusive participation. However, it is yet to be shown if decentralizing conservation leads to diversified livelihoods within a protected area. The purpose of this study was to identify and assess factors affecting household livelihood diversification within Nepal's Kanchenjunga Conservation Area Project, the first protected area in Asia to decentralize conservation. We randomly surveyed 25% of Kanchenjunga households to assess household socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and access to livelihood assets. We used a cluster analysis with the ten most common income generating activities (both on- and off-farm) to group the strategies households use to diversify livelihoods, and a multinomial logistic regression to identify predictors of livelihood diversification. We found four distinct groups of household livelihood strategies with a range of diversification that directly corresponded to household income. The predictors of livelihood diversification were more related to pre-existing socioeconomic and demographic factors (e.g., more landholdings and livestock, fewer dependents, receiving remittances) than activities sponsored by decentralizing conservation (e.g., microcredit, training, education, interaction with project staff). Taken together, our findings indicate that without direct policies to target marginalized groups, decentralized conservation in Kanchenjunga will continue to exclude marginalized groups, limiting a household's ability to diversify their livelihood and perpetuating their dependence on natural resources.

TI  - Pastoralists' perception of and adaptation strategies for climate change: associations with observed climate variability
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
AB  - Although climate change is a universal phenomenon, its indicators and manifestations are entirely local, as are adaptation choices, strategies, and practices. Based on face-to-face interview data from 427 randomly selected pastoral households of the Hulun Buir grassland in northern China, this study investigated perceptions and impacts of historical climate change and the associations of these perceptions with observed climate change. Meanwhile, we identified pastoralists' responses to climate change, as well as barriers to the adaptation process. We used binary logistic regression models to determine the factors that influence climate change adaptation strategies. The results show that pastoralists' perception of the inter-annual variability in climate variables is relatively consistent with the observed meteorological data. Pastoralists' adaptive strategies for climate variability comprise primarily livestock and pasture management interventions, such as purchasing fodder, reducing livestock, part-time grazing, and renting pasture. In addition, pastoralists identified several barriers that are allied with adaptation practices, such as limited grassland tenure, an absence of credit, and limited access to agricultural markets. Furthermore, the sex, age, and education level of the head of household and the household livelihood capital and location were found to be the key factors determining the choice of adaptation strategies. This knowledge helps to assess the needs for action and information and to improve the credibility of policies that shape collective actions based on a unified plan or goal. Combined, these efforts aid in adaptation to reduce the vulnerability of the livestock sector, especially the livelihood security of smallholder pastoralists in grassland ecosystems.

TI  - Informal finance: its drivers and contributions to farm investment among rural farmers in Northcentral Nigeria
T2  - AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW
AB  - Purpose - The problem of inaccessibility of finance for farm investment is a common phenomenon among farmers, especially the rural dwellers. Thus, there is a need to know how the accessibility of informal finance can be increased to increase farm investment. Therefore, this study evaluates farmers' access to informal finance and its contribution to farm investment among rural farmers in Northcentral Nigeria.
   Design/methodology/approach - A three-stage random sampling technique was employed to select 160 farmers. Primary data collected were analysed with descriptive statistics and the Heckman selection model.
   Findings - The study revealed that cooperative society is the major informal means of loan acquisition used by the farmers followed by Rotational Savings and Credit Associations (RoSCAs). Informal loans contributed to agricultural investment through the various operational activities involved in production. Factors influencing farmers' access to informal loans were the age, farm size and income of the farmers. Interest charged, farmers' age, farming experience, household size, education and loan duration were the drivers of the amount borrowed from the informal financing sector.
   Practical implications - The findings of the study call for policies that will sustain informal financial institutions in developing economies, like Nigeria. Thus, the government through its regulatory agencies should assist informal finance providers with the necessary resources to achieve more goals. This is because the informal credit lenders help in bridging financial gaps created by formal financial institutions, such as commercial banks.
   Originality/value - Unlike the previous research studies, this study investigated the driving factors of the amount borrowed from informal finance and its use in farm investment.

TI  - The relationship between collective action and serious illness in western Kenya
T2  - AJAR-AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AIDS RESEARCH
AB  - By 2012 HIV had infected about 1.6 million Kenyans and an estimated 58 000 had died due to HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS rates in western Kenya are disproportionately high compared to the rate in Kenya as a whole. This study aimed to assess gender differences in participation in collective action in households affected by serious illness (e.g., HIV/ AIDS, TB) in western Kenya. We expected serious illnesses would reduce collective action due to a reduction in the number of adults and their ability to care for themselves and others. We used data from a mixed-methods study that used multiple-case embedded-case studies for rural households in western Kenya. The study investigated the relationship between collective action and households affected by serious illnesses. Household health was assessed from information about seriously ill members in 120 households. This information was compared with data about collective action activities and demographic data. Nearly half (48%) the households reported serious illness. More than 1 in 4 (28%) had HIV/AIDS, TB or AIDS-associated illnesses. Women engaged in a moderate level of participation in collective action groups and were statistically more likely to report serious household illness (OR=8.08, 95% CI 2.89, 22.56). Men, who were moderately (OR=3.24, 95% CI 1.27, 8.25) or highly involved in collective action groups (OR=15.43, 95% CI 1.30, 183.06), were statistically more likely to report serious household illness. Collective action groups may help households cope with illness and should be encouraged in communities hard hit with serious illness.

TI  - The social construction of "shared growth": Zambia Sugar and the uneven terrain of social benefit
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE
AB  - Recent years have witnessed a growing trend in agricultural investment and large-scale farmland acquisition in the Global South and a rapid expansion of scholarship and public debate over the nature, consequences, and desirability of these trends. The polarization of this debate into "win/lose" narratives raises the question of whether, and under what conditions, the logic of capital accumulation driving farmland acquisition and investment can engender broad-based social benefits akin to "shared growth." This paper sheds light on this question through a detailed look at the recent expansion of Zambia Sugar's Nakambala Estate in Mazabuka, Zambia. We explore outcomes linked to two of the most prominent pathways through which social benefits are said to accrue: smallholder incorporation and employment. Findings demonstrate the unevenness of outcomes linked to both pathways, with the concrete benefits both claimed and observed through some measures quickly eroding under the weight of alternative performance metrics. The unevenness produced by the intensification of capitalist relations is manifested not just between those differentially positioned with respect to the incoming investment ("outgrower," "employee," and "land loser") but within each of those conditions. This ambiguity opens spaces for competing representations of the promises and pitfalls of these processes, while highlighting the shaky ground on which shared growth and inclusive business agendas stand.

TI  - Toward Sustainability or Efficiency: The Case of Smallholder Coffee Farmers in Vietnam
T2  - ECONOMIES
AB  - This study attempts to uncover the truth behind an increasing number of smallholder farmers participating in sustainable coffee farming in Vietnam. Using stochastic frontier and cost-benefit analysis, a sample of 316 smallholder farmers in Dak Lak was chosen to analyze the economic impacts of sustainable and conventional coffee farming on farmers' welfare. In addition, we conducted field observation and key informant interviews to describe several farming practices. The results highlight the fact that farmers' decisions to participate in sustainable coffee farming are mainly driven by economic benefits. Sustainable farming is more cost-effective and profitable than conventional farming, despite the insignificant difference in production efficiency. Improvement of education, farming knowledge, and collective actions could mitigate negative effects of small-scale production for sustainable coffee farmers. Pesticide management, shade coffee encouragement, and reduction of excessive fertilization, over-irrigation, and unproductive coffee varieties are recommended for sustainable development of the sector.

TI  - Determinants of utilization of agricultural technologies among smallholder dairy farmers in Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH
AB  - Utilization of agricultural technologies plays a crucial role in enhancing the productivity and income of smallholder dairy farmers. However, the uptake of these technologies is low among majority of smallholder farmers especially in developing countries. Using survey data from 682 households in Murang'a County in Kenya, this study examines determinants and intensity of use of artificial insemination, deworming, vaccination, curative treatment, improved feeds (hay, silage) and pregnancy diagnosis. We applied a multivariate probit model for the simultaneous multiple utilization decisions, and ordered probit models for assessing the intensity of utilization. The study results revealed that education level of household head, number of cows owned, livestock type, milk yield, land size, access to contract, price of milk, access to credit, access to business plan training, membership to dairy cooperatives, type of service providers, receiving of remittance, distance to veterinary and output market were the major factors that affect the likelihood of utilizing dairy agricultural technologies among smallholder farmers in Kenya. The intensity of utilizing dairy technologies was influenced by number of cows in the household, livestock type, land size, access to contract, access to credit, membership to dairy cooperatives and type of service providers. In conclusion, utilization of agricultural technologies is influenced by different household, farm, market and transaction cost characteristics, which could hinder or facilitate the uptake of these technologies. The findings will equip agricultural policy makers and agribusiness service providers in addressing the major barriers facing smallholder dairy farmers in making informed utilization decisions of dairy technologies.

TI  - Promoting indigenous entrepreneurship through small-scale contract farming: The poultry sector in Sarawak, Malaysia
T2  - SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
CP  - 22nd Annual Conference of the New-Zealand-Geographical-Society
AB  - Studies have consistently shown that in the relatively unregulated environments of the global economic periphery contract farming has led to highly regressive socioeconomic outcomes. Contract farming is not inherently regressive for the small farm sector however. In the state of Sarawak, Malaysia, contract farming is used as part of an affirmative action programme that trains indigenous smallholders in commercial poultry production. The public sector quasi-market constructed by state purchasers and subsidiary suppliers is one that recognizes the smallholders' limited access to collateral and technical skills and their need to supplement rather than totally replace the incomes already derived from diverse agricultural and off-farm sources. The state-administered contract scheme is part of a broader national goal to eradicate poverty, raise rural incomes and ultimately, develop indigenous entrepreneurship. In the shorter and medium term, as the paper shows, the small-scale public contract scheme, which itself operates within the protected domestic poultry sector in Sarawak, is more likely to support disadvantaged 'bumiputra minorities' than produce a pool of competitive entrepreneurs.

TI  - From Peasant to Farmer: Transformation of Forest Management in China
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - In the past 40 years, China has experienced an unprecedented transformation of the rural society and livelihoods and self-subsistence forest management has transitioned to more business-oriented management, typically the Forestry Cooperatives, Family Forestry Farms and Forestry Specialized Households identified in this study. We explored the factors contributing to this transformation using household survey data in seven provinces in 2016. The age and education of the household heads, income, the holding areas of cropland, ecological forest, forestland, leasing forestland, and legally contracted forestland and their located provinces were found to be statistically significant in transforming the household's forest management. The factors that drive transformation to various ownership types show some variations as well. The findings can help us better understand not only the transformation of forest management, but also the rural economy and society in general. The results have policy implication on how to further facilitate forest management transformation.

TI  - DOES ACCESS TO IMPROVED SANITATION REDUCE CHILDHOOD DIARRHEA IN RURAL INDIA?
T2  - HEALTH ECONOMICS
AB  - Almost nine million children under 5years of age die every year. Diarrhea is considered to be the second leading cause of under-five mortality in developing countries. About one out of five deaths is caused by diarrhea. In this paper, we use the newly available data set District Level Household Survey 3 to quantify the impact of access to improved sanitation on diarrheal morbidity for children less than 5years of age in India. Using propensity score matching, we find that access to improved sanitation reduces the risk of contracting diarrhea by 2.2 percentage points. There is considerable heterogeneity in the impacts of improved sanitation. We find statistically insignificant treatment effects for children in low or middle socioeconomic status households and for girls; however, boys and children in high socioeconomic status households experienced economically significant treatment effects. The magnitude of the treatment effect differs largely by hygiene behavior. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Socio-economic well-being, contract farming and property rights: Evidence from Ghana
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Recently, large-scale land acquisition has increased dramatically in the developing world. The question whether land deals can benefit both the local population and the investor is therefore high on the international agenda. Contract farming is discussed as a possible solution but studies identifying the causal effects are rare. Using data from a quasi-natural experiment in contract allocation, we compare the subjective well-being of outgrowers and independent farmers in the sphere of the biggest palm oil producer in Ghana. We identify a positive causal effect of the outgrower scheme which increases subjective well-being by 1.5 points on a scale of 0-10. We find a substitutive relationship between having an outgrower contract and having property rights, and thus we argue that by increasing security a contract increases well-being, as secure rights to land matter substantially for the overall life satisfaction of non-contract but not of contract farmers.

TI  - Adoption of Tef (Eragrostis Tef) Production Technology Packages in Northwest Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - Adoption of Tef production technology has paramount importance to increase Tef productivity, foster food security, and secure the well-being of smallholder farmers. Hence, this study aims to identify the determinants of adoption of Tef technology packages in Yilmana Densa district, and subsequently assess the factors influencing the intensity of adoption of the technology. In this study, 224 sample households were selected using systematic random sampling techniques. The data were obtained mainly from sampled Tef grower households via structured interviews, and it was supported by key informant interviews. Descriptive statistics such as Chi-square, t-test, and one-way ANOVA were employed. First-hurdle of double hurdle model result revealed that adoption decision of Tef technology packages was determined via the frequency of extension contact, agricultural training, farmers' perception, and farmers' cooperative membership, positively. The second-hurdle result also shown that the adoption intensity of Tef technology packages was influenced by the frequency of extension contact, agricultural training, demonstration participation, and seed multiplication membership, positively, whereas the distance to input market and land fragmentation influenced negatively. Therefore, efforts to be expected from the Ministry of Agriculture, extension agents, and other stockholders to enhance the adoption level of farmers.

TI  - Participation in farmer organizations and adoption of farming technologies among rice farmers in Ghana
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose The authors examine the factors influencing membership in farmer organizations (FO) and their effects on the decision to adopt farm technologies by rice farmers in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a farm survey of 900 households from Northern Ghana and a recursive bivariate probit (RBP) model that accounts for selection bias and endogeneity. Findings The results indicate that the household head's decision to adopt machinery and row planting increases by 38.4 and 25.3%, respectively, upon joining a farmer organization. Membership in farmer organization is positively influenced by off-farm income, asset value, farmer organization location and farmer location in Upper West region but negatively by males, age and total livestock units owned. Machinery adoption is positively influenced by membership in farmer organizations and respondent being male but negatively influenced by the years of schooling, farm size, farm distance and location of a farmer in Ghana's Upper East and West regions. Similarly, row planting adoption is positively influenced by membership in farmers' organization but adversely by farm size, farm distance and a farmer's location in Upper East region of Ghana. Research limitations/implications It can be concluded that membership in farmers' organizations significantly impacts farm household head's decision to adopt machinery and row planting in rice production, which potentially enhance crop productivity. Practical implications These results show the importance of agricultural stakeholders in encouraging the formation and strengthening of farmer organizations to support the adoption of modern farming technologies. Originality/value Developing literature has demonstrated that farmer organizations promote the adoption of agricultural innovations. However, most of these studies have concentrated on conventional agricultural innovations and have used methods that fail to account for potential selection bias. This paper fills this important gap.

TI  - Farmer cooperation in agro-clusters: Evidence from Indonesia
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - Collective action in geographically concentrated farming regions can lead to improvements in farmer income. We model farmer cooperation inside such agro-clusters as a two-stage decision process. From 1,151 completely filled-in questionnaires, we find that being located in an agro-cluster increases farmers' likelihood to cooperate as well as enhances their income. Farmers' attitude towards cooperation is positively influenced by being male, having more assets, and operating a larger farm, but negatively affected if the farmer reports that her household is food vulnerable. The number of hours worked by farmers on the farm and the frequency of face-to-face meetings also raise the probability of engaging in cooperation. A higher density of agro-clusters, higher crop diversity and being located farther away from urban centers are found to increase on average the income level of a farmer. Hence, the promotion of agro-clusters also in rural regions remains a promising initiative for increasing farmer income.

TI  - Exploring variability across cooperatives: economic performance of agricultural cooperatives in northern Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - The number of agricultural cooperatives increased quickly in Ethiopia since the 1990s. While many papers studied the impact of membership of Ethiopian cooperatives, not much is known on their performance. This study takes a cooperative-level perspective which is unique in an African context. It compares the economic performance proxied by sales revenue and profit of a wide range of agricultural cooperatives in northern Ethiopia. Data were collected from 511 agricultural cooperatives in 12 districts of Tigray. The contributing factors of the performance are analyzed with Ordinary Least Squares regression (OLS) and Heckman selection models. Our results underscore the importance of membership size, total assets, presence of conflict among members, and union membership. Chairperson characteristics and the internal organization of a cooperative seem to be less correlated to performance.

TI  - Distributional effects of agricultural cooperatives in China: Exclusion of smallholders and potential gains on participation
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - This paper examines the treatment effects of the agricultural cooperative and publicly funded extension services on individual household economy, using data collected by the author from watermelon-producing farm households in rural Nanjing. The cooperative addressed in this study restricts the participation of small-scale farmers, implying that selection into the program must be taken into consideration for an accurate assessment of the treatment effect. The econometric analysis revealed that government extension services have a modest effect on farm income. In contrast, the treatment effect of the agricultural cooperative is robust and substantially large, accounting for nearly 70% of the pre-matching difference. This suggests that the agricultural cooperative system is an important avenue for farmers to improve their economic status. The treatment effect of the agricultural cooperative is highly heterogeneous; the economic benefits arising from the cooperative are significant only for small-scale farms. We can argue that a coexistence of smallholder exclusion and the treatment effect in favor of small-scale farms poses serious challenges to pro-poor agricultural growth in China.

TI  - Is Fairtrade certification greening agricultural practices? An analysis of Fairtrade environmental standards in Rwanda
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Empirical assessments of the impacts of Fairtrade certification environmental standards are lacking. This paper examines the effects of Fairtrade certification on agricultural practices through the case of coffee in Rwanda, comparing Fairtrade certified cooperative farmers with non-certified cooperative farmers and farmers who do not belong to a cooperative. Survey data from 175 smallholder coffee farmers in Rwanda are reported and analyzed using logistic regression. The results indicate the importance of cooperative farmer organizations in influencing agricultural practices via opportunities for training and access to inputs, and suggest that Fairtrade certification may in fact provide additional opportunities above and beyond cooperative producer organization that influence farmer agricultural practices. However, counter to expectations, Fairtrade certification does not have a strong overall effect on agricultural practices. The effectiveness of Fairtrade at shifting agricultural practices appears to depend on the national regulatory context and the availability of alternative practices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - What is the benefit of membership in farm producer organizations? The case of coffee producers in Peru
T2  - ANNALS OF PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - Empirical evidence of the benefit of farm producer organizations (FPOs) in the developing world is mounting. There is, however, no work in South America on the relationship between FPO membership and farm-level performance. We address the gap by estimating the treatment effect of FPO membership with respect to three outcomes: quantity produced, quantity sold, and price received. The empirical application focuses on the Peruvian coffee sector, where FPOs may have played an important role during the recent price crisis. A sample of approximately 9,000 survey responses from Peruvian coffee producers during the 2015-19 period is used in the analysis. Results show a positive treatment effect of FPO membership on all three farm-level outcomes. Compared to non-FPO members, FPO members produced 120-295 kg/ha more, sold 118-296 kg/ha more, and received 0.42-1.53 PEN/kg more. We also find evidence of heterogeneity in the estimated effect of FPO membership across time, farm size, and membership probability. The findings yield novel implications in terms of policy support for FPOs.

TI  - Community based assessment on knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP), risk factors and One Health perspective of brucellosis in rural and urban settings of Pakistan: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE HELLENIC VETERINARY MEDICAL SOCIETY
AB  - Bovine brucellosis is an endemic zoonotic infection of ruminants in Pakistan with detrimental impact on livestock economy. The major losses caused by brucellosis in animals include abortions, week calves, infertility, and reduced milk production. Regardless of the prevalence of the disease, limited data is available about brucellosis in Pakistan. The present study aimed to access the one health concept in prospective of brucellosis among small-scale dairy farmers by examining knowledge, attitude and practices at the farms and household level that might pose a risk for humans contracting brucellosis. A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among small household dairy farms (n=333) in rural and urban areas of district Rawalpindi and Islamabad. The results revealed almost 74.17% of the participants knew about animal brucellosis and 69.97% of the participants were able to identify the symptoms of animal brucellosis. 46.25% of participants showed knowledge about the transmission of disease from animals to humans. A majority (70.87%) of participants used the raw milk for making other dairy products. Most household farmers are unaware of routes of transmission and major risk factors of brucellosis. Almost all the participants, except veterinarians, including butchers, dairy farm owners and workers, slaughterhouse owners and workers and farmers were involved in at least one risky practice. The moderate knowledge and poor understanding of the disease emphasize the need to initiate awareness programs to educate the farmers who are at high risk along with the improvement of vaccination programs for animals and strict implementation of brucellosis eradication policy which should be devised by government.

TI  - Family Ties and Urban-Rural Linkages among Older Migrants in Nairobi Informal Settlements
T2  - POPULATION SPACE AND PLACE
AB  - Building on African migration as a household survival strategy; urbanrural linkages as critical for migrants' continued engagement with origin communities; reintegration in case of return; and safety net for supplementing precarious urban incomes; we examine the role of family ties in rural origin linkages among 1,693 older migrants living in Nairobi informal settlements. Despite the grim of slum residence, 80% of older migrants in Nairobi slums maintained contact with their rural origin homes during a full year of observation. Family-related factors, especially members of the nuclear family residing in rural origin, explained 45% of explained linkages. Religion, ethnicity, land ownership at origin, and current health and economic statuses are other key predictors. The patterns and reasons of linkages are consistent with migrants' positive contributions to the upkeep of rural origin households. Our findings are well-anchored in the larger continental literature that has shown the urban migrant as not a disembedded individual' but instead part of rural origin collectives. Against the weakness of state safety net system, the study sheds crucial light on the enduring importance of sociocultural networks in people's everyday lives, particularly the importance of family ties for older migrants. To the extent that poor health status, being aged 60years or older, and long duration of residence in the slums, which are predictors of low propensities to maintain contacts with rural origin, are also indicators of diminished social engagement, policy interventions among the urban poor may need to include efforts to enhance rural origin reintegration of the most-aged individuals.

TI  - Following Up on Smallholder Farmers and Supermarkets in Kenya
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - In many developing countries, supermarkets are expanding rapidly. This affects farmers' marketing options. Previous studies have analyzed welfare effects of smallholder participation in supermarket channels from a static perspective, using cross-section data. We develop a conceptual framework and use panel data to better understand participation and impact dynamics. The analysis focuses on vegetable producers in Kenya. Participation in supermarket channels is associated with income gains. However, many farmers have dropped out of the supermarket channel due to various constraints. The initial income gains cannot be sustained when returning to the traditional market. Organizational support may be needed to avoid widening income disparities.

TI  - Preference for rural living environment improvement initiatives in China
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY
AB  - The Chinese government has launched the Rural Living Environment Improvement Initiative (RLEII) to solve the poor living conditions in rural areas. The initiative enhances rural greenery; provides sanitary toilets; and promotes proper disposal of animal manure, sewage, and household waste in rural areas. We collected data using in-person interviews with 938 rural residents in Xinjiang, China, to elicit their preference, preference intensity, and preference heterogeneity for RLEII. Results indicated that rural residents prefer to see shortcomings of the RLEII addressed. Rural greening construction is identified with the highest preference intensity. We also find significant heterogeneity in rural residents' preferences for each attribute of RLEII. The preference heterogeneity is rooted in the region's economic condition (poor vs. nonpoor region). It is essential to understand rural residents' choice for rural public goods supply and to respect their preference intensity, sequence, and heterogeneity for RLEII to enhance the implementation performance. We discuss the implications of these findings.

TI  - The influence of information communication technology on farmers' sales channels in environmentally affected areas of China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - The rapid development of information communication technology (ICT), represented by mobile phones and the Internet, allows capitalizing to a greater extent on the wealth of information and knowledge available for agriculture knowledge and can be used to increase production, conserve the environment, etc. This study analyzes the current market-oriented behavioral effects of information communication technologies on farmers, based on data of 1263 rural households in two highly environmentally affected and major vegetable producing provinces-Shandong and Hebei. A probit model was used to analyze the impact of information communication technology on the choice of farmers' sales channels. The results show that the differences between the farm households with and without access to ICT, as well as those who actively or passively acquire information, have a significant impact on the choice of sales channels. Using ICT increases the probability that farmers choose sales through middlemen and cooperatives and reduces the probability of self-sales. Actively acquiring information has a positive impact on the cooperative channel choice and a significant negative impact on self-sales. Accordingly, we recommend that the government should increase the penetration rate of ICT, strengthen the information technology in rural areas, emphasize the construction of information sources, such as the collection and distribution of market information, enhance information literacy among farmers, reduce their transaction costs, and increase overall farmer participation in the market.

TI  - Farmers' awareness and perception of Lake Ziway (Ethiopia) and its watershed management
T2  - LIMNOLOGICA
AB  - The article examines how heads of farmers' households perceive the socioeconomic benefits of Lake Ziway (Ethiopia), the causes of its current degradation, and the state of land and water use management in its watershed. The investigation was based on in-depth empirical field work including a survey with 635 heads of smallholder farmers' households via interview using semi-structured questionnaires. Further, water abstraction was estimated from three districts that border with the lake. Respondents believe that Lake Ziway provides a number of individual and collective benefits for local communities, private companies and public institution. They stated, however, that the lake is under pressure from the floriculture industry and other investment projects, high population growth and subsequent expansion of settlements and irrigation farms, high applications of agrochemicals, soil erosion, uncontrolled water abstraction, and deforestation in the watershed. The respondents further believe that these activities are degrading the lake water quality, shrinking its water volume and decreasing its fish population. After examining government's efforts to address these activities, the majority of respondents believe that the government role in the whole watershed is weak. This study contributes to better understand the local socio-ecological coherences and the problems Lake Ziway and its watershed are facing. It also provides information regarding long-term sustainable land and water use planning strategies for the lake and management of its watershed, which could also be applied to other lakes in Ethiopia, and beyond.

TI  - Factors influencing the choice of marketing channel by rice producers: evidence from the Mekong Delta Region, Vietnam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VALUE CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB  - The study examined the factors influencing the choice of rice marketing channel by smallholder rice producers in the Mekong Delta Region (MDR) of Vietnam. A multistage sampling technique was used to collect data from 405 rice producers in three provinces, namely, Can Tho, Dong Thap, and Tien Giang. The empirical results from the logit regression model reveal that distance to markets, asset endowment, farm size, sales quantity, price of rice, contract farming, organisational membership, access to credit, extension services, access to transportation, and storage facilities, influenced farmers' choice between direct and indirect channels. The findings suggest that policies should aim at setting up the appropriate floor price, improving transport infrastructure, providing formal credit and input subsidy, supporting farmer organisations, and strengthening extension services to help these farmers improve their livelihoods.

TI  - The social relations of health care and household resource allocation in neoliberal Nicaragua
T2  - BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS
AB  - Background: With the transition to neoliberalism, Nicaragua's once-critically acclaimed health care services have substantially diminished. Local level social formations have been under pressure to try to bridge gaps as the state's role in the provision of health care and other vital social services has decreased. This paper presents a case study of how global and national health policies reverberated in the social relations of an extended network of female kin in a rural community during late 2002 - 2003.
   Methods: The qualitative methods used in this ethnographic study included semi-structured interviews completed during bi-weekly visits to 51 households, background interviews with 20 lay and professional health practitioners working in the public and private sectors, and participant-observation conducted in the region's government health centers. Interviews and observational field notes were manually coded and iteratively reviewed to identify and conceptually organize emergent themes. Three households of extended kin were selected from the larger sample to examine as a case study.
   Results: The ongoing erosion of vital services formerly provided by the public sector generated considerable frustration and tension among households, networks of extended kin, and neighbors. As resource allocations for health care seeking and other needs were negotiated within and across households, longstanding ideals of reciprocal exchange persisted, but in conditions of poverty, expectations were often unfulfilled, exposing the tension between the need for social support, versus the increasingly oppositional positioning of social network members as sources of competition for limited resources.
   Conclusions: In compliance with neoliberal structural adjustment policies mandated by multilateral and bilateral agencies, government-provided health care services have been severely restricted in Nicaragua. As the national safety net for health care has been eroded, the viability of local level social formations and their ability to respond to struggles collectively has been put at risk as well. Bi-lateral and multilateral agencies need to take into account local needs and demands, and implement policies in a manner that respects national laws, and protects both the physical and social well-being of individuals.

TI  - Does climate change stimulate household vulnerability and income diversity? Evidence from southern coastal region of Bangladesh
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Bangladesh is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries globally, where the livelihood of agro-based dependent people became vulnerable due to different natural hazards, especially in the southern coastal part. This study investigates the influence of climate change on household vulnerability and income diversity, data collected from the climate-vulnerable coastal areas of Bangladesh. Both panel data regression and structural equation model were employed to examine the vulnerability status, whereas income diversity was measured through diversity index and "Type-66" livelihood strategy. Results reveal that sources of income have diversified over time. However, the study also reveals that climate change-especially the increase in salinity has affected crop production, resulting in increased income vulnerability of small and marginal farmers who are highly reliant on farm income. Moreover, findings reveal that climate change has influenced households to diversify into low-income sources that do not help to overcome their income vulnerability. Therefore, a cooperative land management system, establishment of embankment, training, and skill development programs are needed to generate feasible alternative income sources to improve the livelihood of coastal people.

TI  - Shade tree diversity, carbon sequestration, and epiphyte presence in coffee agroecosystems: A decade of smallholder management in San Ramon, Nicaragua
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Coffee smallholder management practices have received attention for their potential to conserve biodiversity and sequester carbon by maintaining structural complexity, high canopy diversity, and minimal external inputs. We conducted shade tree surveys on 95 1000 m(2) research plots over a 10-year period to identify patterns of shade tree density and diversity, epiphyte presence, and carbon stocks within smallholder shade coffee systems of northern Nicaragua. We also analyzed each of these parameters with respect to management by comparing collectively-and individually-managed farms. Our results indicate that the overall shade tree density has decreased over time (F = 42.597, p < 0.001), but that diversity remained constant. Carbon stocks in coffee systems also showed a decreasing trend over time (F = 2.981, p = 0.056), most likely due to the decreasing tree densities. Epiphytic plant presence increased over time despite decreased host tree densities, suggesting either a change in management or improved habitat conditions for epiphytes. Research plots on individually-managed coffee farms generally had higher shade tree densities than those on collectively managed farms (t = 2.141, p = 0.037), but we found no differences in shade tree species richness or carbon stocks (t = 0.573, p = 0.568). We conclude that smallholder coffee farmers continue to conserve both shade tree diversity and epiphyte communities. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of contract farming on diets and nutrition in Ghana
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES AND POLICY
AB  - Contract farming gained importance in many developing countries. While effects of contracting on smallholder farmers' incomes were analyzed in previous studies, diet and nutrition effects are not yet well understood. Here, we examine the effects of contract farming on dietary diversity and child anthropometrics, using survey data from the palm oil sector in Ghana. Contracting improves smallholder nutrition, but the effects vary by contract type. We distinguish between marketing contracts and resource-providing contracts that affect household labor use and gender roles differently. For both contract types, contracting female farmers has larger positive child nutrition effects than contracting male farmers.

TI  - Heterogeneous choice in the demand for agriculture credit in China: results from an in-the-field choice experiment
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose In this study, the authors examined demand-side credit in rural China with the aims of understanding attribute preferences and the willingness of farmers to pay for credit. Design/methodology/approach The authors implemented an in-the-field discrete choice experiment (DCE) using a D-optimal block (6 x 9 x 3) design applied to 420 farm households across five Chinese provinces (Shandong, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu and Henan) in the summer and fall of 2018. The DCE included six attributes including the interest rate, term of loan, type of loan, type of repayment, type of institution and mobile banking services. Findings Conditional and mixed logit results indicated a downward sloping credit demand curve with variable elasticity across regions. Provincial willingness-to-pay (WTP) indicators suggested that farmers were willing to pay a premium for long-term ( 0.03-0.687%) and low collateral credit loans ( 0.79-2.93%). Also, four of five provinces indicated a preference for loan amortization rather than lump-sum payment. Interestingly, in comparison to the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), only farmers in Shandong, Sichuan and Shaanxi indicated a preference for rural credit cooperatives (RCCs)/banks and the Postal Savings Bank of China (PSBC). Another quite surprising result was bank services, in our case, access to mobile banking did not appear to induce WTP for agricultural credit. While conditional and mixed logit regression coefficients were similar (and therefore robust), the authors found that there was substantial heterogeneity across attribute preferences on term of loan, type of loan and amortization. Preferences for type of lender and mobile banking were generally homogenous. This result alone suggested that lenders should consider offering a suite of credit products with different attributes in order to maximize the potential pool of borrowers. While there were some differences across provinces, farmers appeared to be indifferent to lenders, and it did not appear that offering banking services such as mobile banking had any bearing on credit decisions. Research limitations/implications This paper presents a first step in using in-the-field choice experiments to better understand rural finance in China. Although the sample size satisfies conventional levels of significance and rank conditions, the authors caution against attributing results to China as a whole. Different provinces have different institutional structures and agricultural growing conditions and economies and these effects may differentially affect WTP for credit. Although by all indications farmers were aware of credit, not all farmers, in fact a minority, actually borrowed from a financial institution. This is not unusual in China, but for these farmers, the DCE was posed as hypothetical. Likewise, the study's design was based on a generic credit product typical of rural China, and the authors caution against making inferences about other products with different attributes and risk structures. Social implications This study is motivated by the rapidly changing dynamic in China's agricultural economy. With specific reference to new laws and regulations about the transfer of land use rights (LURs), China's agricultural economy is undergoing significant and rapid change which will require better understanding by policy makers, lenders and practitioners of the changing credit needs of farmers, including the new and emerging class of commercial farmers.
   Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, the authors believe that the result provided in this paper present the first use of in-the-field DCE and are the first to be reported in either the English or Chinese literature on rural credit product design.

TI  - Removing border protection on wheat and rice: effects on rural income and food self-sufficiency in China
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - In this paper, I use the Monash Multi-Country model - a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model of China, Australia and the Rest of the World - to analyse the effects of removing border protection on wheat and rice in China. The analysis points to the possibility that removing border protection on wheat and rice may lead to an increase in rural income in China. This is mainly due to the following two factors. First, removing border protection on wheat and rice not only leads to a contraction in agricultural activities, but also leads to an expansion in manufacturing and services activities. Second, on average, rural households in China obtain over half of their income from manufacturing and services activities.

TI  - Locked out? China's health insurance scheme and internal migration
T2  - LABOUR ECONOMICS
AB  - Providing health insurance with certain geographical restrictions may lead to misallocations in the labour market by hindering migration. This paper tests whether the rural health insurance first introduced in 2003, the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), had unintended and negative effects on rural-to-urban migration mobility in China. The NCMS offers health insurance only to people with rural household registration, and they can benefit from the NCMS only when visiting the hospitals near their registered location in the household registration system. An event-study approach to a new dataset collected from provincial yearbooks in China reveals at the county level that the NCMS reduces the percentage and rate of growth of the percentage of rural residents who are rural-to-urban migrants and who work outside their home county. Using the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), my instrumental variable (IV) results show that being enrolled in the NCMS reduces the probability of individual-level migrating. The IV is a time-variant dummy indicating the counties that have relative early NCMS implementations. I also use the CHNS to construct a county-level dataset and replicate the county-level results. Together, the results suggest that the NCMS "locks " the rural labour force into rural areas and further hinders geographical job mobility in China.

TI  - Process evaluation of the Intervention with Microfinance for AIDS and Gender Equity (IMAGE) in rural South Africa
T2  - HEALTH EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB  - The Intervention with Microfinance for AIDS and Gender Equity (IMAGE) combines microfinance, gender/HIV training and community mobilization (CM) in South Africa. A trial found reduced intimate partner violence among clients but less evidence for impact on sexual behaviour among clients' households or communities. This process evaluation examined how feasible IMAGE was to deliver and how accessible and acceptable it was to intended beneficiaries during a trial and subsequent scale-up. Data came from attendance registers, financial records, observations, structured questionnaires (378) and focus group discussions and interviews (128) with clients and staff. Gender/HIV training and CM were managed initially by an academic unit ('linked' model) and later by the microfinance institution (MFI) ('parallel' model). Microfinance and gender/HIV training were feasible to deliver and accessible and acceptable to most clients. Though participation in CM was high for some clients, others experienced barriers to collective action, a finding which may help explain lack of intervention effects among household/community members. Delivery was feasible in the short term but both models were considered unsustainable in the longer term. A linked model involving a MFI and a non-academic partner agency may be more sustainable and is being tried. Feasible models for delivering microfinance and health promotion require further investigation.

TI  - The Association Between the New Rural Cooperative Medical System and Health Care Seeking Behavior Among Middle-Aged and Older Chinese
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGING & SOCIAL POLICY
AB  - The new rural cooperative medical system (NCMS) is the primary form of social insurance in rural China. This study aims to explore how the NCMS influences the health care seeking behaviors of middle-aged and older Chinese, considering the family and community contexts. A series of multi-level (three-level) models using data from the first wave of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) are used. We find that the presence of NCMS coverage has a statistically significant association with seeking inpatient and outpatient care but not physical checkups among middle-aged and older rural Chinese: Rural residents insured by NCMS were more likely to seek inpatient and outpatient care than people who were not insured. Other factors at the individual level (such as self-perceived health and number of doctor-diagnosed chronic diseases), the family level (such as living arrangements and household expenditures), and the community level (such as the presence of township hospitals within the community) are also significant predictors of health care seeking behaviors.

TI  - The impact of digital technology use on farmers' low-carbon production behavior under the background of carbon emission peak and carbon neutrality goals
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - In the digital economy era, as a new production factor, digital technology can break through the information blocking constraints on farmers' behavior, become an important driving force affecting farmers' low-carbon production behavior, and provide new opportunities for agricultural green low-carbon transformation and the realization of carbon emission peak and carbon neutrality goals. Based on the field survey data of 571 farm households in Jiangsu Province, China, this paper employs the Ordered Probit model and the mediating effect test method, and takes risk cognition as the mediating variable to empirically analyze the impact of digital technology use on farmers' low-carbon production behavior and its path. The study results show that environmental risk cognition, health risk cognition, agricultural product safety risk cognition, and pesticide residue risk cognition have a significant positive impact on farmers' low-carbon production behavior. Study findings also reveal that, on one side, the use of digital technology has a direct effect on the farmers' low-carbon production behavior, on the other side, it indirectly affects the farmers' low-carbon production behavior by affecting their risk cognition, that is, risk cognition plays a partial mediation role in this relationship. Furthermore, the results indicate that among the control variables, joint cooperative membership, food security knowledge, agricultural income, technical guidance, and following instructions have a significant and positive impact on farmers' low-carbon production behavior. Based on study findings, the variable "number of the labor force " has a negative and significant impact on farmers' low-carbon production behavior. Based on study findings, to effectively realize carbon emission peak and carbon neutrality goals and promote sustainable and high-quality agriculture development, agricultural policy makers should pay attention to the role of digital technology to actively promote low-carbon production behavior.

TI  - Impact and mechanism of rural labor migration on forest management income: Evidence from the Jiangxi Province, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - This article explores how rural labor migration affects the forest management income. Based on consecutive annual surveys of 397 forest households in the Jiangxi Province from 2011 to 2018, the panel-Tobit and IV-Tobit and mediation models are conducted. The studies showed that the migration effect of labor migration inhibits forest management income, and the remittance effect of labor migration has a promoting effect, but the total effect of labor migration inhibited household forest management income. A heterogeneity analysis showed that, the labor migration effect in hilly and mountainous areas has a significant inhibitory effect on forest management income, while the promoting effect of the remittance effect of labor migration on forest management income is only significant in plain areas. At the same time, compared with the elderly group, the migration effect of labor migration of the youth group has a greater inhibitory effect on household forest management income, while the impact of the remittance effect of labor migration is only significant in the elderly group. A test of action mechanism showed that, cash investment plays a partial mediating role on the impact of labor migration effect on forest management income, but it has a suppressing role in the impact of the remittance effect. Labor input plays a partial mediating role on both the labor migration effect and the labor remittance effect on forest management income. Our analysis provides an important basis for policymakers to formulate pertinent policies to support forest management in collective forest regions.

TI  - Land tenure (in)security and crop-tree intercropping in rural Xinjiang, China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The relationship between land tenure security and long-term land-related investment is of great importance especially given the current flux in property rights systems of agricultural land in China. This paper empirically examines the role of land tenure security in farmers' crop-tree intercropping decisions, and is based on a comparative analysis between contract land and wasteland holders in rural Xinjiang, China. Data from a survey, carried out in 2008 among 352 households in Awati County in Xinjiang, is used to estimate the factors that affect the adoption of crop-tree intercropping. The results indicate that, for those households that only have contract land, land tenure security positively affects their adoption of crop-tree intercropping. However, for those that hold both contract land and wasteland, land tenure security negatively impacts upon their adoption of crop-tree intercropping on wasteland, as the crop-tree intercropping on wasteland can increase the perceived tenure security of wasteland. The results also suggest that the comprehensive effect of labor organization on intercropping is moderate as a result of the presence of counteracting effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - How can organic rice be a boon to smallholders? Evidence from contract farming in India
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Demand for organic basmati rice (OBR), both at home and abroad, coupled with policy reforms have given rise to contract farming (CF) production in India. OBR production, however, is highly susceptible to weather and pest risks. This study investigates the impact of smallholders' perceived production risks on their adoption of CF in OBR farming. We also assess the impact of CF in OBR production on yields, prices received, and the livelihood of OBR producers. We use farm-level data from smallholder organic basmati rice farms in India and the endogenous switching regression method to account for heterogeneity. Although CF in OBR led to lower yields, it increased the prices producers received and improved the livelihood of OBR producers. The impact of CF varied with farmers' revealed risk attitudes. Risk-loving OBR growers with CF experienced the highest loss in yields, and risk averse OBR growers with CF received the highest prices. We find that the OBR growers who did not adopt CF would benefit from adopting it, regardless of their risk attitudes, especially when it comes to prices received and livelihood.

TI  - Did contracting effect the use of primary health care units in Pakistan?
T2  - HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB  - For many years, Pakistan has had a wide network of Basic Health Units spread across the country, but their utilization by the population in rural and peri-urban areas has remained low. As of 2004, in an attempt to improve the utilization and performance of these public primary healthcare facilities, the government has gradually started contracting-in intergovernmental organizations to manage these BHUs. Using five nationally representative household surveys conducted between 2001 and 2012, and exploiting the gradual roll-out of this reform to apply a difference-in-difference approach, we evaluate its impact on BHU utilization. We find that contracting of the BHU management did not have any effect on health care use generally in the population, but it did significantly increase the use of BHU for childhood diarrhoea for the poor (by 4% points) and rural (3% points) households. These increases were accompanied by lower rates of self-treatment and private facilities usage. We do not find any significant effects on the self-reported satisfaction with BHU utilization. Our findings contrast with earlier small-scale studies that reported larger effects of the contracting of primary care in Pakistan. We speculate that the modest additional budget, the limited management authority of the contracting agency and the lack of clear performance indicators are reasons for the small impact of the contracting reform. Apparently critical aspects of services delivery such as location of BHUs, ineffective referral system and medical practice variation in public and private sectors have contributed to the overall low utilization of BHUs, yet these were beyond the scope of the contracting reform.

TI  - Carmine cochineal: fortune wasted in northern Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR CACTUS DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Carmine cochineal, Dactylopius coccus Costa, was introduced to northern Ethiopia to add considerable value to existing cactus pear vegetation that in places like the southern Tigray was becoming an invasive plant. It became an investment opportunity where Foodsafe, a Chilean company was involved. Company was granted 300 ha at the cactus pear infested plains of southern Tigray. Foodsafe was also expected to expand cochineal production through an outgrower scheme. It created employment opportunity for the locals and started exporting dried cochineal to Mexico and Germany bringing in foreign currency. As cactus pear grows in communal lands, conflict of interest arose and it polarised the community. The company was forcibly closed and it was a tragedy that a one time commercial insect became a full-fledged invasive insect pest. Attempts to contain the insect with mechanical and chemical control were not successful. So far more than 16,000 ha of cactus pear land was infested with carmine cochineal. 13,000 ton of dried cochineal could have been harvested in a single year, generated USD $52 million, and part of that money could have been used for its management.

TI  - A decision support system for institutional support to farmers in the face of climate change challenges in Limpopo province
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Smallholder farmers in South Africa continue to be affected by the changing climate despite the existence of support to improve their adaptive capacity. This study focused on the institutional support systems and support types available to farmers in agro-ecological zones of Limpopo Province and assessed support types best suited to each area. Six hundred farmers were purposively sampled across the agro-ecological zones of Limpopo and interviewed. Support types looked at included monetary, machinery, seeds, educational support and others (irrigation scheme, animals, fertilizer, pesticides). Supporting institutions included Agro finance institutions, DAFF, Banks, and NGOs. Results showed that 70.01% of farmers received support from DAFF 25.60% from NGO's and 4.39% from Agro finance institutions. The most number of support received was two types 33.3% of the farmers. The result from the ANOVA showed that there were no significant differences in the level of difficulty experienced by farmers in accessing the various support institutions across the agro-ecological zones. In terms of the various support types received, there was a statistically significant difference in seeds (p = 0.002 < alpha = 0.05) and educational (p = 0.0001 < alpha = 0.05) support received between the different areas. Furthermore, the support needs varied across zones with farmers in arid-zone needing machinery, education, seeds and lastly monetary support while the semi-arid zone needed machinery, education, others, seeds, monetary and the humid, machinery, education, others, money and seeds. It is therefore recommended that support for farmers should be location-specific in order to enhance the adaptive capacity of an area and not be based only on the availability of certain support. There is a need for proper coordination between institutions in their aim to assist farmers to cope with climate

TI  - RETRACTED: Double cropping in paddy fields of northern Iran: Current trends and determinants of adoption (Retracted article. See vol. 95, 2020)
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Double cropping is an essential strategy for increasing crop productivity, promoting employment, satisfying food demands, and enhancing sustainability of production. However, much of the evidence on which farmers double crop (and if so, how often) is anecdotal. Factors affecting the adoption of double cropping were explored in Rasht County of Guilan Province in northern Iran. Most farmers (58.3%) practiced double cropping with one crop (i.e., ratoon rice, vegetables or pulses). Leafy vegetables, such as coriander (Coriandrum sativum), parsley (Petroselinum crispum), spinach (Spinacia oleracea), and garden cress (Lepidium sativum) as well as root vegetables, such as garlic (Allium sativum), carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus), and radish (Raphanus sativus) were the most common vegetables. Cranberry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and faba bean (Vicia faba) were the most common pulses. Almost a third of the farmers (32.5%) practiced double cropping with a combination of two crops (i.e., ratoon rice plus vegetables or ratoon rice plus pulses). Adopters of double cropping had a more positive attitude for this cropping practice (as expressed by perceptions of high profitability and sufficient satisfaction of household food demands), higher levels of social participation (i.e., participation in cooperatives, associations, unions) and cooperation with other farmers, more use of communication tools (i.e., TV, radio, internet, magazines), and higher income from rice farming than the non-adopters. A logistic regression model with predictive ability 72.8% showed that farmers' attitude towards double cropping had the greatest role in the prediction of its acceptance followed by attendance of education courses and farming experience. The results are of practical significance for policy-makers who seek the best options for greater farm productivity and well-being in developing countries. Training courses and discussion meetings, particularly targeted to young farmers, as well as the establishment of cooperatives to foster social participation could motivate adoption of double cropping.

TI  - The link between mental health and safe drinking water behaviors in a vulnerable population in rural Malawi
T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Background: Mental disorders, particularly depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, are common long-term psychological outcomes in emergency contexts arising from conflicts, natural disasters, and other challenging environmental conditions. In emergencies, people suffer not only from the lack of external resources such as drinking water and food but also from poor mental health. Mental disorders can substantially impair daily activities in vulnerable individuals. However, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) behaviors are daily activities that require effort, time, and strong internal motivation. Therefore, questions arise: whether there is a relationship between mental health and safe water behaviors, and if so, whether the motivational drivers of these behaviors are affected by mental health.
   Methods: Our cross-sectional study conducted face-to-face interviews with 638 households in rural Malawi. We used a quantitative questionnaire based on the risks, attitudes, norms, abilities, and self-regulation (RANAS) approach to measure motivational psychosocial factors. Mental health was assessed using the validated Chichewa version of the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20). Results. Almost a third of the respondents reported poor mental health. We found significant negative association between mental health and self-reported safe water collection (p = .01, r = -.104) but not between safe water transportation and storage behavior. The moderation analysis revealed significant interaction effects of mental health with some psychosocial factors and therefore on WASH behaviors. Poor mental health changed the influence of three psychosocial factors-perceived others' behavior, commitment, and remembering-on safe drinking water collection behavior. The influence on water transportation and storage behavior of the perceived severity of contracting a disease, the belief that transporting and storing water requires substantial effort, and others' approval depended on the mental health condition of the respondent.
   Conclusions: These results imply that populations with a significant proportion of individuals with poor mental health will benefit from interventions to mitigate mental health before or parallel to behavioral change interventions for WASH. Specific population-level interventions have been shown to have a positive effect on mental well-being, and they have been successfully applied at scale. This research is especially relevant in emergency contexts, as it indicates that mental health measures before any WASH interventions will make them more effective.

TI  - Water Management, Rainwater Harvesting and Predictive Variables in Rural Households
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB  - Water management in rural domestic households plays an important role in reducing water-related health risks. This study was conducted to examine the relationships between the dependent variable (rural domestic rainwater management) and the independent predictive variables (personal characteristics, tank size, years of water harvest, rainwater harvesting associations, usage instructions including water borne health risk, and tank operation and maintenance) in Uganda. Logistic regression techniques were used on a random sample of 301 respondents to ascertain the influence of predictive variables on rural domestic rainwater management. Analyses of the hypothesised relationship revealed three statistically significant results: years of water harvest, rainwater harvesting associations and usage instructions. Overall, the findings suggest that consideration of usage instructions including waterborne health risks, years of harvest, and local water associations, will improve domestic water management, in combination with progressive measures focused on water quality and quantity. Moreover, medical expenses and time spent in hospitals or health dispensaries will be minimised and saved through utilisation of usage instructions. Experienced harvesting households, those with few years of harvest, and non participants as well in local water associations will easily enrich knowledge of how to minimise contracting water-related diseases.

TI  - Comprehensive evaluation of rural courtyard utilization efficiency: A case study in Shandong Province, Eastern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
AB  - China is implementing the strategy of Rural Revitalization. Revitalizing idle and inefficient utilization courtyards is an important measure for rural revitalization. The evaluation of courtyard utilization efficiency is the basis of determining the idle and inefficient utilization courtyards in order to revitalizing it. This study provided a reference for the optimal use of rural courtyard utilization and revitalization through the quantitative comprehensive evaluation of courtyard utilization efficiency and the classification of courtyard utilization types. Taking Shandong Province in Eastern China as study area, we selected eight surveyed villages by stratified sampling method. According to the scale of the villages, full survey and sample survey were used, while middle-aged men who familiar with the courtyards were selected as the respondents. Through a household questionnaire survey and face-to-face interviews from 2017 to 2018, 578 questionnaires of rural courtyards in eight villages were obtained. Then based on the functions of rural courtyard and land resource conditions, 16 comprehensive factors were formulated, involving land conditions, construction conditions and economic benefits, to build the comprehensive evaluation index system of rural courtyard utilization efficiency. Next the index weight was determined by analytic hierarchy process, and the linear weighted regression model was used to evaluate the utilization efficiency of rural courtyard. Finally, the K-means clustering analysis was used to classify the utilization efficiency of courtyards. The results showed that among the eight villages, the average utilization efficiency of courtyards was moderate (one village was low, five were moderate, and two were high). The proportions of both idle and inefficiently utilized courtyards were high. There were three vital factors leading to the idle and low efficiency of rural courtyards. They were declining rural industries, limited arable land per capita, and more farmer workers. In this case, the utilization efficiency of courtyards should be improved by transferring rural land, developing secondary and tertiary industries, evaluating the development potential of villages, classifying and optimizing courtyard utilization, so as to make full use of idle and inefficient courtyards, increase the income of farmers and collectives and promote the revitalization of rural areas.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Environmental and Economic Performance of Agricultural Cooperatives and Smallholder Farmers for Apple Production in China
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - China is the world's largest apple producer, and agricultural cooperatives play an important role in promoting sustainable production in its whole life cycle system. However, few studies on cooperatives have evaluated the environmental and economic performance from the life cycle thinking perspective. In this study, the combined methods of life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) were used to comparatively analyze the environmental and economic performance of apple production between cooperatives and smallholder farmers. The results showed that, compared to the smallholder farmers, cooperatives significantly reduced resource depletion and environmental impacts by 12.50-22.16% in each category. The total environmental index for the cooperatives was 7.44% and 22.09% lower than smallholder farmers; meanwhile, the total LCC was 2659.71 Chinese Yuan (CNY), 19.27% lower than smallholder farmers. However, the net profit was 2990.29 CNY for the cooperatives, 21.23% higher than smallholder farmers. The results indicated that cooperatives exhibited a higher net profit while having lower resource input, environmental impact, and LCC than smallholder farmers. Moreover, pesticides and fertilizers were identified as the most critical environmental hotspots. Moreover, human labor cost was the most significant contributor to the total economic cost of the apple production system. These findings provide insights into optimizing farm inputs for apple production and active participation in agricultural cooperatives to alleviate multiple environmental impacts while maintaining apple yield and improving economic benefits, intending to make a marginal contribution to promoting sustainable development of the apple industry in China.

TI  - Enhancing the adoption of climate-smart technologies using public-private partnerships: lessons from the WEMA case in South Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Climate-smart agricultural technological innovations have the potential to reduce climate change impacts on agriculture. Due to several barriers, their current rate of adoption and diffusion is low. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have the potential to facilitate technology development and dissemination to smallholder farmers. The aim of this paper is to examine the role of the water efficient maize for Africa (WEMA) project in enhancing technology adoption by smallholder farmers in South Africa. This study explores how PPPs enhance technology adoption and highlights the challenges faced within PPPs using WEMA case. A critical analysis, involving iterative process helped to construct a comprehensive narrative. We found that disputed outcomes, stakeholder concerns, shortage of seeds, disinclination of local companies to market new seeds, upkeep of previous relationships, contractual arrangements and high level of expertise and skills required from farmers were the main factors that affected the efficacy and impact of WEMA on the targeted output and beneficiaries.

TI  - How Do Capital Asset Interactions Affect Livelihood Sensitivity to Climatic Stresses? Insights From the Northeastern Floodplains of Bangladesh
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper offers a novel methodological approach for better understanding how different capital assets can be organized, transformed, and used in different combinations to reduce livelihood sensitivity to climatic stresses - an area that requires greater research attention in the context of adaptation policy. Research was conducted in the northeastern floodplain communities of Bangladesh, regarded as one of the most climate sensitive, resource poor, and highly understudied areas of the country. This wetland-dominated ecosystem is home to diverse resources user groups (e.g., farmer and fisher) who are subjected to regular seasonal flooding, excessive rainfall, drought, and flash floods. Working in 12 adjacent villages of two significant wetlands (Hakaluki haor and Tanguar haor), qualitative and quantitative data were collected through 15 focus groups (n = 15), 35 key informant interviews, and 356 household surveys to better understand how community members adapt in response to their livelihood sensitivity to the climatic stresses. Results indicate that community members organize and transform capital assets in diverse ways to escape climate-induced "poverty traps". Findings also reveal that interventions from external agencies (e.g., government, non-governmental organizations and market institutions) are an important key to livelihood sustainability for many households.

TI  - The drivers of contract eucalypt farming in Thailand
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - Eucalypt plantations and contract farming for eucalypts have expanded and are now occurring on a large scale despite concerns about their social and environmental impacts. Our analysis shows that Thai policies and land tenure context have been the principal driers of the adoption of eucalypt tree growing by Thai smallholders. Thai policies and land tenure system are responsible for the current key role played by smallholders in pulp production. Contract eucalypt farming has become critical for the major pulp companies in Thailand to secure the supply of the raw material. Companies use contract farming to promote eucalypts among smallholders who have not farmed them before and secure their supply in a context of strong competition among buyers. None of the impacts of contract eucalypt farming on the environment and on livelihoods in general are well understood yet, and the paper argues that, to inform appropriate policy development, there is a need to explain how contract tree farming impacts livelihoods.

TI  - Modeling environmental variability and network formation among pastoral nomadic households: Implications for the rise of the Mongol Empire
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - We use agent-based computer simulation to test the effect of environmental conditions (available biomass/carrying capacity and environmental risk) on the development of wealth inequality and patron-client herding networks in nomadic pastoral economies. Our results show that 1) wealth inequality reaches very high levels when carrying capacity is high and risk is low, and 2) patron-client contract herding networks increase in size and duration when carrying capacity is high and risk is low. We compare empirical data from the Mongol (1206-1368 CE) and Xiongnu (209 BCE- 48 CE) empires with simulation results to develop an explanatory mechanism for the apparent correlation between nomadic empire creation and positive environmental conditions. We argue that the internal dynamics of nomadic pastoral societies are sufficient to produce high degrees of inequality and hierarchical herding networks. Nomadic empires are more likely to form during key periods of increased biomass and decreased environmental risk.

TI  - Three rights separation: China's proposed rural land rights reform and four types of local trials
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - China's central government is promoting a new round of land reform in its rural areas, the core of which is the so-called 'three rights separation system'. In attempting to achieve the double goals of developing agriculture and maintaining the basic stability of rural society, central policy makers want to separate the original household right of contractual operation into a contractual right (right of disposal) and an operation right. When formally adopted, these two rights, combined with the village collective ownership, will constitute China's new structure of farmland rights. Many local governments are already using practical approaches involving the separation of the three rights, providing a valuable reference for its formalization in the future.
   In this paper, we analyze four relevant existing approaches by case studies of four representative projects. The results show that, while all four have in different ways reached the goal of increased scale of farmland operations, all are facing different contradictions and conflicts among the collectives, local governments and farmers, due to different farmland interests, demands and endowment problems. In response, a new framework is developed involving three rights separation, entailing some new meanings. This involves the repositioning of the four leading players in the distribution of farmland rights the state, collective, part-time farmers and professional farmers in order to realize the free transfer, monetization and redistribution of farmland rights to meet the demands of all the parties involved. With this framework, collective ownership is limited to the management of the award and recovery of the contractual right instead of specific agricultural operations. The introduction of a contractual right exit mechanism encourages the contractual right to be sold back to the collective for awarding directly to the professional farmers. In this way, the transfer of the operation right to professional farmers is encouraged as far as possible to enable them to increase their operating area and agricultural income.

TI  - The Extent and Structure of Peri-urban Smallholder Dairy Farming in Five Cities in India
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - Livestock keeping is common in many cities in India, driven by the demand for animal-source foods, particularly perishable milk. We selected five cities from different regions of the country and conducted a census in 34 randomly selected peri-urban villages to identify and describe all smallholder dairy farms. In total 1,690 smallholder dairy farms were identified, keeping on average 2.2 milking cows and 0.7 milking buffaloes. In Bhubaneswar, the proportion of cows milking was only 50%, but in other cities it was 63-73%. In two of the five cities, more than 90% of the farmers stated that dairy production was their main source of income, while <50% in the other cities reported this. In one of the cities, only 36% of the households kept milk for themselves. Market channels varied considerably; in one city about 90% of farms sold milk to traders, in another, 90% sold to the dairy cooperative, and in another around 90% sold directly to consumers. In conclusion, peri-urban dairy systems in India are important but also varying between different cities, with only one city, Bengaluru, having a well-developed cooperative system, and the northeastern poorer region being more dependent on traders. Further studies may be needed to elucidate the importance and to design appropriate developmental interventions.

TI  - The benefits of geographical indication certification through farmer organizations on low-income farmers: the case of Hoa Vang sticky rice in Vietnam
T2  - CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB  - Origin labeling and quality upgrading through farmer organizations have been considered as solutions to reduce transaction costs and improve market bargaining power. This paper explores whether belonging to a farmer organization that improves and signals quality can help increase yields and household incomes of small-scale farmers for a specific quality product, Hoa Vang sticky rice in Vietnam. The paper is based on primary data on 185 households collected in 2013 and on 149 households collected in 2015. Different econometric methods were applied to investigate the effect based on rice yield, rice income and household income as the outcome variables. The results show that membership of farmer organization does not significantly improve household income compared to non-membership. However, members of farmer organizations have less resources in terms of land and inputs than non-members. These results suggest that the economic results achieved by farmers with fewer opportunities to access markets are similar to those obtained by farmers with more opportunities thanks to the involvement of farmer organizations in marketing. The specificities of the Hoa Vang sticky rice are still not reflected in higher farmer sales prices and incomes. More dialogue between farmer organizations and their customers is thus required, as well as better public control of labeling fraud.
