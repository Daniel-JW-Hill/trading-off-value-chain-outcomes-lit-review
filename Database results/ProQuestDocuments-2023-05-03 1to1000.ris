T1  - Do market outlet combinations improve smallholder gross margin for smallholder French beans producers?
AN  - 2806674239
AB  - Procurement of fresh produce necessitates a consistent, high-quality, supply. This study examined effects of a single, and combined, market strategy on gross margin of smallholder French bean[s] (Phaselous vulgaris L.) farmers. A random sample of 215 farmers was used and a multinomial endogenous switching regression model analyzed the data. The choice of a market outlet combination was influenced by gender of the household decision-maker, household size, education, off-farm income, group membership, extension service, farming experience, off-farm income, credit access, and market reliability. Participating in multiple market outlets increased gross margin per season. Smallholder farmers reported USD 225.66 per season when selling in all vertical coordination options. Growers were worse off by participating in the contract option only, with reduced gross margin. Adoption of all market outlets was positively influenced by education and off-farm income. Smallholder French bean farmer’s socio-economic circumstances matter in shaping the choice of market outlet combinations, while market diversification is important for smallholder producers.

T1  - Economic performance of certified cocoa-based agroforestry systems in Cameroon
AN  - 2802646909
AB  - Several studies exist today on the adoption of innovations (certification) in the cocoa value chain in Africa’s largest cocoa-producing countries (Ivoiry Coast and Ghana). Despite the importance of the cocoa sector in Cameroon’s economy and as a source of income to the majority of its farmers, similar studies are few. In view of the above, this article evaluates the impact of certification on the economic performance of cocoa-based agroforestry systems in Cameroon’s main production basins (the Center and South West Regions). Primary data, from 506 identified farmers, were complemented by those from field observations and a survey of key resource persons of the cocoa sector. The evaluation was carried out using the quasi-experimental method. The endogenous switching regression (ESR) treatment effects complemented with a binary propensity score matching methods were adopted to test their robustness and reduced selection bias from both observed and unobserved characteristics. Obtained results showed that the adoption of certification significantly and positively impacted the economic performance of cocoa producers, in yield (at about 87 kg/ha) and value (~ 200 USD). Hence, government and private developmental partners should jointly finance and organize the cocoa sector and facilitate small farmers’ access to certification norms.

T1  - Risk preference interactions between individual farmers and small farmer groups: Experimental evidence from rural Ethiopia
AN  - 2793978904
AB  - The understanding of risk preference interactions among poor farmers in developing countries has important policy implications, as many programs that aim to alleviate poverty and address risk constraints are provided on a collective basis. We conduct a randomized field experiment in the drought‐prone parts of Northern Ethiopia and elicit from poor, vulnerable farmers their hypothetical willingness to pay using individual and group lottery games. Analyzing the certainty equivalent ratios (CERs), we find that farmer groups are more risk averse than individual farmers. When the risk of the lottery is high, the group CER is primarily determined by the most‐risk‐averse farmer of the group, and to a lesser extent, by the least. The median farmer contributes to the group CER only when the lottery risk is moderate. After participating in the group elicitation, individual farmers also become as risk averse as the group on average. Specifically, the median and the least‐risk‐averse farmers become significantly more risk averse while the most‐risk‐averse farmer is unaffected. Our results show that policymakers should carefully consider how social interactions in rural communities affect individual and group risk preference and whether social interactions also affect the participation and effectiveness of development programs.

T1  - Hiding in plain sight: the emergence of modern dairy farms in India
AN  - 2788457224
AB  - PurposeThis paper provides one of the first and most detailed accounts of the large modern dairy farms that are emerging in the dairy sector in India. Qualitative interviews are used to understand how these farms differ from their traditional smallholder counterparts and how well integrated they are into the value chains.Design/methodology/approachSnowball sampling was used to identify large farmers. In total, 49 in-depth interviews were conducted with large commercial modern farms in Punjab. A detailed description of the main characteristics of these modern dairy farms is provided. Data from previous studies conducted in Punjab is used to compare the new farms with traditional smallholder farms.FindingsThe modern dairy farms are much more advanced in their use of technology compared to their traditional counterparts. These large commercial modern farms are very well integrated into the value chains. They often, but not exclusively, sell milk to formal supply chains, sometimes on a contractual basis.Originality/valueMost of the literature on the Indian dairy sector focuses on smallholders. However, understanding and acknowledging the emergence of modern dairy farms is very important in understanding the development of value chains not only in the dairy sector in India, but in domestic food sectors in developing countries in general. This qualitative data analysis is a necessary first step if more large-scale representative information is to be collected in the future.

T1  - Ageing threatens sustainability of smallholder farming in China
AN  - 2799233285
AB  - Rapid demographic ageing substantially affects socioeconomic development1-4 and presents considerable challenges for food security and agricultural sustainability5-8, which have so far not been well understood. Here, by using data from more than 15,000 rural households with crops but no livestock across China, we show that rural population ageing reduced farm size by 4% through transferring cropland ownership and land abandonment (approximately 4 million hectares) in 2019, taking the population age structure in 1990 as a benchmark. These changes led to a reduction of agricultural inputs, including chemical fertilizers, manure and machinery, which decreased agricultural output and labour productivity by 5% and 4%, respectively, further lowering farmers' income by 15%. Meanwhile, fertilizer loss increased by 3%, resulting in higher pollutant emissions to the environment. In new farming models, such as cooperative farming, farms tend to be larger and operated by younger farmers, who have a higher average education level, hence improving agricultural management. By encouraging the transition to new farming models, the negative consequences of ageing can be reversed. Agricultural input, farm size and farmer's income would grow by approximately 14%, 20% and 26%, respectively, and fertilizer loss would reduce by 4% in 2100 compared with that in 2020. This suggests that management of rural ageing will contribute to a comprehensive transformation of smallholder farming to sustainable agriculture in China.

T1  - Impact of the coronavirus pandemic on financial returns of smallholder coffee plantations in Lao PDR
AN  - 2797450162
AB  - Laos is among the top twenty coffee producing country in the world—producing about 39,000 tonnes per year—and most of its production is currently exported to over 26 countries, contributing about 1.1% of the total export value or US$64.3 million in 2019 to Laos’ national economy. COVID-19 restrictions on trade and movement of people have largely impacted on coffee markets and production. As a strategic crop in Laos, it is supported by a range of policies and programs to generate greater benefits to both independent smallholder farmers and those involved in cooperatives, including support for agroforestry production models involving coffee and tree crops. However, studies of the profitability of different coffee agroforestry models are limited. This study compares financial returns from four most popular coffee agroforestry models in two coffee production provinces of Laos, before and during COVID-19 pandemic. The data were gathered from 20 farmers, five coffee traders and an integrated coffee processing company. These data were then triangulated with, and supplemented by, interviews with coffee exporters (n = 3) and key informants (n = 4). Financial indicators suggest that all four agroforestry models were profitable before COVID, but profits for cooperative growers were higher than for smallholders due to higher crop productivity and lower costs. Despite higher prices due to COVID restrictions, other factors reduced profitability of all four models and one smallholder model became unprofitable. The reasons for such differences and related policy implications are discussed.

T1  - Agriculture value chain sustainability during COVID-19: an emerging economy perspective
AN  - 2786012928
AB  - PurposeAgriculture value chains (AVCs) have experienced unprecedented disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic, with lockdowns and stringent social distancing restrictions making buying and selling behaviours complex and uncertain. This study aims provide a theoretical framework describing the stakeholder behaviours that arise in severely disrupted value chains, which give rise to inter-organisational initiatives that impact industry sustainability.Design/methodology/approachA mixed-methods approach is adopted, in which uncertainty theory and relational governance theory and structured interviews with 15 AVC stakeholders underpin the initial conceptual model. The framework is empirically validated via partial least squares structural equation modelling using data from an online survey of 185 AVC stakeholders based in India.FindingsThe findings reveal that buyer and supplier uncertainty created by the COVID-19 lockdowns gives rise to behaviours that encourage stakeholders to engage in relational governance initiatives. Progressive farmers and other AVC stakeholders welcome this improved information sharing, which encourages self-reliance that positively impacts agricultural productivity and sustainability.Practical implicationsThe new framework offers farmers and other stakeholders in developing nations possibilities to sustain their AVCs even in dire circumstances. In India, this also requires an enabling ecosystem to enhance smallholders' marketing power and help them take advantage of recent agricultural reforms.Originality/valueResearch is scarce into the impact of buyer and seller behaviour during extreme supply chain disruptions. This study applies relational governance and uncertainty theories, leading to a proposed risk aversion theory.

T1  - Beyond the bean: Analyzing diversified farming, food security, dietary diversity, and gender in Nicaragua’s smallholders coffee cooperatives
AN  - 2779284919
AB  - Diversification is key for agroecological transformations, but little is known about how it relates to farmers’ dietary diversity and food sovereignty. Our team and coffee cooperative staff conducted a participatory action research mixed methods study, including 171 surveys and 50 interviews. Over 70% of the farmers reported self-initiated diversification activities. Statistical analysis showed a significant positive correlation between crop diversity and dietary diversity, while controlling for farm size and income. To assess gender relations females responded to 41% of the surveys, and we separated focus groups by sex. Average male-owned farms were 1.8 ha larger than women-owned farms, yet we found no significant differences in household food security or dietary diversity. Additional disparities included male vs. female perceptions about who does additional diversification work and who decides about strategies. Although the co-op has a strong gender equity and technical assistance program, our analysis of extension training documents identified useful content and a smaller percent of female participants in diversification vs. gender sessions. Suggested strategic actions for co-op planning include supporting: (1) female land ownership, (2) diversification focused farmer-led experimentation, and (3) more training for men on gender, women on diversification, and all participants in feminist agroecology.

T1  - An analysis of governance factors influencing performance of selected smallholder dairy cooperatives in Zimbabwe
AN  - 2776877488
AB  - Abstract Cooperatives are organisations owned and operated by individuals or groups that come together for mutual benefit including pooling of resources for the purchase of inputs and marketing of products. Marketing of milk is through dairy cooperatives where the milk collection centres are mandated to help integrating smallholder farmers into competitive markets. The study investigated governance structures of five smallholder dairy schemes purposively selected based on their agroecological regions in Zimbabwe. The aim of the study was to explore how the governing boards conduct their business, particularly marketing milk, and how this affects allocation of resources (milk production and deliveries to milk centres) by smallholder farmers. Qualitative data were collected using focus group discussions with 20 dairy cooperative members from each milk collection centre. Key informant interviews were conducted with chairpersons, management committee members, and dairy value chain stakeholders such as dairy associations and processors. The SWOT analysis technique was employed to identify governance structures highlighting major strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats as a gateway to isolating strategies for enhancing centre performance. An analysis of implications of the governance structures on resource allocation decision by farmers was also performed. So focus is on how boards are discharging mandate such as marketing on behalf of farmers, price setting and negotiations, trainings, and accountability to members. Such factors if executed well will see farmers increasing milk production and deliveries to MCC yielding positive results in income and profits. The study results show that poor governance mainly caused by incompetent boards and management committees was the major factor affecting performance. Other findings were that if good governance factors were in place, then cooperatives became proficient leading to their growth. Thus, cooperatives must adopt business models based on private sector partnerships to maximise on expertise and technical support. The schemes ought to take advantage of existing opportunities, especially policies that mitigate threats and improve product diversity, value addition, and effective pricing strategies. To achieve these milestones, capacity building roadmaps ought to identify competent and efficient boards.

T1  - The role of transformational leadership and leaders’ skills for new agricultural cooperatives in post‐soviet countries: Annales de l'economie Collective
AN  - 2774096573
AB  - Team leadership plays a crucial role in the management of agricultural cooperatives, especially in post‐Soviet countries where farmers keep bad experiences from the collectivization of their farms. The main objective of the research was to investigate how important the role of leadership is in the process of establishing, initial sustaining of cooperation and members’ commitment among small farmers in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Leadership was analysed from multiple perspectives using an explanatory sequential mixed approach involving quantitative and qualitative methods. We interviewed 293 cooperative leaders and members. The partial least squares structural equation model was used to examine the relationship between multiple constructs and variables. We concluded that leaders do differ in some of their characteristics from other members. They are the most active in the group, influencing all major decisions, playing a crucial role in trust‐building and group cohesion. Their skills and leadership style are significantly important for members’ commitment to the group's success. However, the dominance of group founders and lack of understanding of cooperative principles among members indicate some emerging challenges to the cooperatives’ sustainability and efficiency, and it is necessary to focus on the progressive professionalization and capacity building of leaders while maintaining a transformational leadership style.

T1  - Biochar Systems in Ghana
TT  - Systèmes de Biochar au Ghana
AN  - 2802993367
AB  - Le biochar est une biomasse pyrolysée incorporée dans le sol pour améliorer la santé du sol. L'ajout de biochar dans les sols offre la possibilité d'un triple bénéfice pour les moyens de subsistance, l'environnement et le climat. Dans les environnements oü une grande quantité de biomasse est générée et pose des problemes d'élimination, le biochar reste une alternative viable pour résoudre les problemes agronomiques et environnementaux, en particulier dans les sols fortement dégradés. Des recherches considérables sur le biochar au cours des années ont indiqué son potentiel pour résoudre de nombreux problemes environnementaux, cependant il y a toujours un manque de connaissances sur les aspects spécifiques de la production et de l'utilisation du biochar. En outre, un certain nombre d'affirmations relatives a l'impact positif du biochar en agriculture n'ont pas été bien expliquées scientifiquement et vérifiées. Au Ghana, la recherche sur le biochar est récente et actuellement non coordonnée avec des résultats de recherche non clairement documentés et visibles. Il y a un besoin urgent d'examiner les informations disponibles sur les résultats de la recherche sur le biochar au Ghana et de fournir un avis d'expert sur la faisabilité de l'intégration de la technologie dans un systeme agricole spécifique. L'objectif de cet article est de présenter un examen approfondi de la recherche sur le biochar au Ghana, en ce qui concerne l'agriculture et la gestion de l'environnement. Les défis de la technologie du biochar, la formulation, la disponibilité des matieres premieres et les taux d'adoption sont discutés. Il existe un large éventail de matieres premieres potentielles pour la production de biochar a partir de résidus agricoles. La quantité d'application de biochar a un effet prononcé sur le rendement en grain de mais oü 5 t ha_l a donné significativement plus de grain de mais que 2.5 t ha_l. Les sols amendés avec du biochar de cabosse de cacao ont augmenté le rendement en grain de mais de 56 % par rapport aux sols non amendés. Le biochar peut contribuer a améliorer la productivité des cultures dans les petites exploitations, bien que ses chaînes d'approvisionnement et de valeur ne soient pas formalisées et que le produit ne soit pas familier dans la plupart des communautés agricoles. Les politiques qui integrent le biochar a l'intensification durable de l'agriculture sont recommandées.Alternate abstract:Biochar is a pyrolysed biomass, incorporated into soil for improvement of soil health. Biochar added to soils holds the potential of a triple-win for livelihoods, environment and the climate. In environments where a lot of biomass is generated and poses disposable challenges, biochar remains a viable alternative for solving both agronomic and environmental problems, especially in highly degraded soils. Considerable research into biochar over the years have indicated its potential to solve many environmental problems, however there is still lack of knowledge about specific aspects of biochar production and use. Also, a number of assertions related to the positive impact of biochar in agriculture have not been well explained scientifically and verified. In Ghana, research on biochar is recent and currently uncoordinated with research outputs not clearly documented and visible. There is the urgent need to review available information on biochar research outputs in Ghana and provide expert opinion on the feasibility of embedding the technology in specific farming systems. The aim of this paper is to present an in-depth review of biochar research in Ghana, as it relates to agriculture and environmental management. Challenges to the biochar technology, formulation, feedstock availability and adoption rates are discussed. There is wide array of potential feedstocks for biochar production from agricultural residues. The quantity of biochar application has pronounced effect on maize grain yield where 5 t ha4 significantly yielded more maize grain than 2.5 t ha4. Soils amended with cocoa pod biochar increased maize grain yield by 56 % compared to un-amended soil. Biochar can contribute to improving crop productivity on smallholdings although its supply and value chains are not formalized and the product is unfamiliar in most farming communities. Policies that integrate biochar to sustainable intensification in agriculture is recommended.

T1  - Determinants of smallholder farmers' membership in co-operative societies: evidence from rural Kenya
AN  - 2771456657
AB  - Purpose>Despite the potential for co-operatives to improve smallholder farmers' livelihoods, membership in the co-operatives is low. This study examines factors that influence smallholder farmers' decisions to join agricultural co-operatives.Design/methodology/approach>This study involved a survey of 1,274 smallholder chicken farmers. The data were analysed through a two-sample t-test of association, Pearson's Chi-square test and binary probit regression model.Findings>The results suggest that farming as the main source of income, owning a chicken house, education attainment, attending training or accessing information, vaccination of goats and keeping a larger herd of goats are the key factors which significantly influence co-operative membership. However, gender, age, household size, distance to the nearest agrovet, vaccinating chicken and the number of chickens kept do not influence co-operative membership.Research limitations/implications>The survey did not capture data on some variables which have been shown to influence co-operative membership. Nevertheless, the results show key explanatory variables which influence membership in co-operatives.Practical implications>These findings have implications for development agencies that seek to use co-operatives for agricultural development and improvement of smallholder farmers' livelihoods. The agencies can use the results to initiate interventions relevant for different types of smallholder farmers through co-operatives.Originality/value>This study highlights the influence of smallholder farmers' financial investments in farming and the extent of commercialisation on co-operative membership. Due to low membership in co-operatives, recognising the heterogeneity of smallholder farmers is the key in agricultural development interventions through co-operative membership.Peer review>The peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/IJSE-03-2022-0165.

T1  - The Role of Emotion and Calculative Self-Interest in Trust Perception:Case of the Dairy Value Chain
AN  - 2769438191
AB  - Trust among actors plays an important role in contracting decisions and cooperative membership. There is, however, a concern to understand trust development and the determinants of trust perception. In this paper, trust perception is explained by emotions and calculative self-interest along with other predictors, namely transaction costs in the value chain exchange. We assume that emotional non-calculative trust and calculative self-interest are both present in local rural economies, making this context appropriate to test our hypothesis regarding the importance of emotional links in networking and contracting along the value chain. We used a sample of breeders in a local community to construct the emotional non-calculative self-interest and the calculative self-interest components and investigated how these two indicators contribute to generate trust perception. In addition, transaction costs related to opportunism, uncertainty and, dependency have strong effect on trust perception. The results provide support that emotional non-calculative self-interest fosters trust perception; despite opportunistic behavior and distrust, breeders are able to build trusty links using close relationships. Smallholder dairy farmers could use existing social networks to control high transaction costs, to foster trust and institute sustainable contracts as a way to coordinate transactions.

T1  - Roles of Agricultural Cooperatives (ACs) in Drought Risk Management among Smallholder Farmers in Pursat and Kampong Speu Provinces, Cambodia
AN  - 2806608485
AB  - This research aims to investigate the roles of agricultural cooperatives (ACs) in the provinces Pursat and Kampong Speu, Cambodia, with respect to managing the drought risks among smallholder farmers, with particular focus on the following factors: (a) the impacts of drought on socio-economic development and livelihood; (b) the services delivered by AC operations in terms of increasing the five livelihood assets; and (c) the interactions between AC operations, adaptive capacity, and the impacts of drought. Household surveys were conducted among 421 smallholder farmers; in addition, case studies were also conducted with stakeholders in the Bakan district in Pursat Province and the Barsedth district in Kampong Speu Province. The study demonstrates that (i) both climatic and human-made factors contributed toward the impact of drought in the Bakan and Barsedth districts. Furthermore, this hazard affected smallholder farmers. (ii) AC operations increased the smallholder farmers’ access to natural and physical assets. Currently, AC operations are constrained by a lack of willingness and commitment in AC committees, trust building in the communities, and human and financial resources after development projects, which are implemented by non-governmental organizations (NGOs). (iii) Adaptive capacity contributed to the drought impacts and participation in AC activities, but the involvement in AC activities did not contribute to AC operations nor to aiding with the impacts of drought. This empirical research, which was performed via structural education modeling (SEM), fills a gap in the literature by increasing the understanding of the roles of AC operations in the context of drought risk management and their role in increasing access to the five livelihood assets.

T1  - Diversity of Food Insecurity Coping Strategies among Livestock Farmers in Northern Cape Province of South Africa
AN  - 2806486569
AB  - Small-scale livestock farmers in the drylands of South Africa are highly exposed to agricultural drought-related food insecurity. Research has used descriptive analyses and missed the need to index the diversity of coping strategies used for managing agricultural drought-induced food insecurity. This study was conducted to bridge this gap using a two-step procedure. Initially, the study identified the farmers’ coping strategies and food security status. A coping strategy diversity index was computed using the Shannon–Weiner method and its relationship with the food security status was determined. Secondly, the determinants of the coping strategy diversity index were explored using an ordered logit regression model after testing for the proportional odds assumption. A mixed methods approach was utilized and a standardized questionnaire was administered to 217 smallholder livestock farmers in the Northern Cape province of South Africa. The household food insecurity mean score (8.429 ± 7.105) from the household food insecurity scale (HFIAS) was significantly related to a higher diversity of coping strategies. Similar results were reported for the household food insecurity access prevalence (HFIAP) status. The different forms of support (e.g., cash, food, training and assets) had a significant (p < 0.05) and positive effect on the coping strategy diversity index among the households. Education, access to credit and insurance facilities and the frequency of droughts significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the diversity of coping strategies under drought conditions. The utilization of cash reserves and investment stocks also significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the extent of coping strategy diversity. The study recommended strengthening the functional and technical capacity pillars of dealing with agricultural drought through strategic partnerships between the government and livestock value chain players. This collaboration should target affordable credit lines tailor-made for farmers to cope with agricultural drought. If well-coordinated, these interventions should reduce food insecurity prevalence, especially during drought conditions among vulnerable smallholder livestock farmers. Lessons from this study could also inform future research on the effectiveness of the current agricultural drought coping strategies while expanding the diversity clusters over space and time.

T1  - Supporting participatory livestock feed improvement using the Feed Assessment Tool (FEAST)
AN  - 2794788183
AB  - Livestock production is central to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries, but livestock are often poorly fed which limits their potential for reducing poverty. Efforts to improve livestock nutrition are often driven by supply-push thinking and fail to engage meaningfully with farmers and the realities they face. The Feed Assessment Tool (FEAST) was developed as a way of involving farmers more closely in decision making on livestock feed improvement. FEAST is a participatory tool which uses focus group discussions and individual farmer interviews to develop a broad overview of the livestock farming system. FEAST has been applied in many countries in the last 10 years. Examples of intensive use come from the Accelerated Value Chain Development Project in Kenya and the Rwanda Dairy Development Project in Rwanda. In both cases the tool was used to inform feed options with strong input from farmers. Although the primary purpose of FEAST is to support improved feed strategies at farm level, the data collected through the FEAST app and published in FEAST reports are a rich information resource that can be useful for developing broader system-level understanding of livestock feed issues. FEAST data can be uploaded into a global data repository where they are available for researchers. These data are also used to generate visualizations of key feed metrics further extending the use of secondary data. FEAST is an example of a participatory tool that moves decision making in the direction of farmers, while providing insights to researchers working across farming systems. Its widespread use across many countries is an indication that it fills a gap in in the livestock feed development space. Its novelty lies in bridging the knowledge gap (both ways) between livestock researchers and small-scale livestock keepers.

T1  - Study on the Impact of Social Capital on Farmers’ Decision-Making Behavior of Adopting Trusteeship Services
AN  - 2791740018
AB  - The development of sustainable agriculture is an important link in promoting agricultural modernization. As a new sustainable agricultural production model, the promotion effect of agricultural production trust depends on the participation of farmers. Therefore, based on the micro-data of 461 valid questionnaires from farmers in the Heilongjiang Province and the Heckman sample selection model, this study empirically analyzed the impact of social capital on the decision behavior of farmers to adopt custody services from two aspects of adoption behavior and adoption degree. The results showed that social capital had a significant positive impact on the adoption behavior and the degree of adoption of rural households’ trusteeship services. From the perspective of different business scales, for large-scale households, participation in the service promotion activities of agricultural means of production suppliers and trust in the technical information disseminated by the government had a significant positive impact on the adoption of custody services. However, for small farmers, participating in village collective service promotion activities and trusting the service information spread by their neighbors’ relatives and friends had a significant positive impact on trust adoption behavior. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the impact of social capital on farmers’ trust adoption behavior decision making in the future agricultural trust service promotion process to accelerate the promotion of sustainable agricultural development.

T1  - Relationships between Farmer Psychological Profiles and Farm Business Performance amongst Smallholder Beef and Poultry Farmers in South Africa
AN  - 2791550970
AB  - Beef cattle and poultry are critically important livestock for improving household food security and alleviating poverty amongst smallholder farmers in South Africa. In this paper, our goal is to examine the relationships between farmer psychological profiles and farm business performance of commercially oriented beef cattle and poultry smallholder farmers in South Africa. We employ a multipronged interdisciplinary approach to test the theory of planned behaviour and its relationship to farm business performance. First, a behavioural science-informed survey instrument was employed to collect data from randomly selected farmer participants in two major beef and poultry projects undertaken by the authors. Second, a latent profile analysis was used to identify the psychological profiles of those farmers. Third, traditional and estimated indicators of farm business performance were obtained using descriptive and econometric-based approaches, including logistic regression and stochastic frontier analyses. The estimated farm business performance indicators were correlated with the psychological profiles of farmers. Results from the latent profile analysis showed three distinct profiles of beef and poultry farmers clearly differentiated by their ability to control and succeed in their farm business enterprises; criteria included attitude, openness to ideas, personality, perceived capabilities, self-efficacy, time orientation, and farm- and personal-related concerns. Profile 1 (‘Fatalists’) scored themselves negatively on their ability to control and succeed in their business enterprises. The majority of farmers were generally neutral about their ability to control and succeed in their businesses (Profile 2, ‘Traditionalists’), while a relatively small group of farmers were confident of their ability to succeed (Profile 3, ‘Entrepreneurs’). We found evidence of significant differences in farm business performance amongst the different profiles of farmers. As far as we can determine, this is the only study to have assessed farm business performance based on a differentiation of farmers’ psychological profiles. Our results provide a framework to further investigate whether particular types of on-farm interventions and training methods can be customised for different segments of farmers based on their preferred learning styles.

T1  - Occurrence and associated risk factors of aflatoxin contamination in animal feeds and raw milk from three agroecological zones of Tanzania
AN  - 2789609055
AB  - Aflatoxins (AFs) are natural toxic compounds produced by a specific type of fungi, which subsequently contaminate foods and animal feeds, potentially carcinogenic to humans. This study assessed the AFs awareness, prevalence and associated risk factors through a survey of the smallholder dairy farmers (SDFs) and livestock feeds and raw cow milk samples from three agroecological zones in Tanzania. The aflatoxin awareness among SDFs (419) and agrovet dealers (26) was 23.2% and 50%, respectively. The prevalence of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1 ) in livestock feeds from agrovet dealers, and SDFs was 88.5 and 86.2%, with a concentration ranging from a limit of detection (LOD) to 22.99 and 32.9 μg/kg, respectively. However, 15.38 and 22.5% of AFB 1 detected samples from agrovet dealers and SDFs exceeded the European Union (EU) and Tanzanian Bureau of Standards (TBS) limits of 5 μg/kg for dairy cow feeds. The prevalence of aflatoxin M 1 (AFM 1 ) in raw cow milk was 30.7%, of which 27.9% exceeded the EU and TBS limits of 0.05 μg/l for raw cow milk. The risk factors associated with AFB 1 and AFM 1 were cattle feeding systems: zero-grazing (odds ratio (OR) = 11.3 (1.5-22.9)) and mixed feeding (OR=16.0 (1.4-43.6)), use of concentrates feeds (OR=12.0 (0.6-55.6)), mixed feeding (OR=5.0 (0.5-11.1)); feed handling and storage practices: no moisture content measurement (OR=2.0 (0.3-15.0)) and storing feeds (OR=3.6 (1.7-8.5)); agroecological zones: central zone (OR=15.2 (5.4-50.6)) and northern zone (OR=2.1 (0.7-7.3)); aflatoxin (AF) awareness and level of education: primary (OR=16.0 (2.5-155.3)) and secondary education (OR=8.0 (2.14-43.9)) ( P <0.05). This study revealed a high prevalence of aflatoxin contamination in animal feeds and raw cow milk, suggesting a potential health risk to consumers. Therefore, it is vital to increase awareness and knowledge on AFs, proper handling, storage and monitoring of feeds among the stakeholders in the dairy value chain.

T1  - Farmer and market vendor perceptions of COVID-19 impacts on horticultural fresh food systems in Tonga, Fiji, and Samoa
AN  - 2788483991
AB  - BackgroundWhen the global COVID-19 pandemic and state of emergency was declared in early 2020, South Pacific Island nations rapidly closed their borders resulting in significant socio-economic upheaval. With the South Pacific region highly vulnerable to external shocks, there was concern amongst Pacific governments and international donors as to the implications of COVID-19 restrictions on the local food system.MethodsHorticultural farmers and market vendors (n = 825) were surveyed in Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa, using local enumerators, over a five-month period (July to November 2020), which represented the initial phase of COVID-19 restrictions in the region. Data were disaggregated based on location, farmer and vendor impacts, and postharvest loss.ResultsFarmers in Fiji (86%) were more likely to experience difficulties in selling their crops during the initial stages of COVID-19 restrictions, compared to farmers on the smaller Pacific Island nations of Tonga (10%) or Samoa (53%). While market vendors in Fiji (73.2%) and Tonga (56.8%) were similarly impacted, few vendors (22%) in Samoa were affected. Farmers and market vendors on the islands of Viti Levu (Fiji) and Upolu (Samoa), specifically those supplying or located in the key urban centres were more likely to experience elevated postharvest loss. Elevated postharvest loss due to COVID-19 was more prevalent amongst municipal market vendors, peri-urban farms and vendors sourcing from larger commercial farms. Road-side vendors and vendors in the rural areas were less likely to incur elevated loss.ConclusionsWhile fresh horticultural food systems in Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa were all adversely effected by COVID-19 restrictions, these impacts were more acute in Fiji. Given value chains associated with main urban centres were more likely to incur elevated postharvest loss, this would imply consumers were avoiding town centres and alternatively sourcing fresh fruit and vegetable from rural road-side vendors. Pacific road-side vendors appear to have provided an important fresh food distribution capacity during local COVID-19 travel restrictions.

T1  - Innovative Research Offers New Hope for Managing African Swine Fever Better in Resource-Limited Smallholder Farming Settings: A Timely Update
AN  - 2779574699
AB  - African swine fever (ASF) in domestic pigs has, since its discovery in Africa more than a century ago, been associated with subsistence pig keeping with low levels of biosecurity. Likewise, smallholder and backyard pig farming in resource-limited settings have been notably affected during the ongoing epidemic in Eastern Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Caribbean regions. Many challenges to managing ASF in such settings have been identified in the ongoing as well as previous epidemics. Consistent implementation of biosecurity at all nodes in the value chain remains most important for controlling and preventing ASF. Recent research from Asia, Africa, and Europe has provided science-based information that can be of value in overcoming some of the hurdles faced for implementing biosecurity in resource-limited contexts. In this narrative review we examine a selection of these studies elucidating innovative solutions such as shorter boiling times for inactivating ASF virus in swill, participatory planning of interventions for risk mitigation for ASF, better understanding of smallholder pig-keeper perceptions and constraints, modified culling, and safe alternatives for disposal of carcasses of pigs that have died of ASF. The aim of the review is to increase acceptance and implementation of science-based approaches that increase the feasibility of managing, and the possibility to prevent, ASF in resource-limited settings. This could contribute to protecting hundreds of thousands of livelihoods that depend upon pigs and enable small-scale pig production to reach its full potential for poverty alleviation and food security.

T1  - Socio-ecological benefits of fine-flavor cacao in its center of origin
AN  - 2779464785
AB  - In the tropics, combining food security with biodiversity conservation remains a major challenge. Tropical agroforestry systems are among the most biodiversity-friendly and productive land-use systems, and 70% of cocoa is grown by >6 million smallholder farmers living on <2$ per day. In cacao's main centre of diversification, the western Amazon region, interest is growing to achieve premium prices with the conversion of high-yielding, but mostly bulk-quality cacao to native fine-flavor cacao varieties, culturally important since pre-Columbian times. Conversion to native cacao can be expected to favor adaptation to regional climate and growth conditions, and to enhance native biodiversity and ecosystem services such as biological pest control and pollination, but possibly also imply susceptibility to diseases. Experience from successful conversion of non-native cacao plantations to fine-flavor cacao agroforestry with rejuvenation by grafting and under medium-canopy cover levels (30%–40%) can ensure a smooth transition with only minor temporary productivity gaps. This includes ongoing selection programs of high yielding and disease resistant native fine-flavor cacao genotypes and organizing in cooperatives to buffer the high market volatility. In conclusion, the recent interest on converting bulk cacao to a diversity of native fine-flavor varieties in countries like Peru is a challenge, but offers promising socio-ecological perspectives.

T1  - An Assessment of Economic Sustainability and Efficiency in Small-Scale Broiler Farms in Limpopo Province: A Review
AN  - 2775037829
AB  - An important factor in determining the success of a small-scale broiler farm is its economic viability and efficiency. During times of trouble for the industry, the idea receives more attention. The conceptual considerations of economic sustainability and efficiency are frequently quite constrained, according to the difficulties raised in this study and by other authors. There is a lack of information about South Africa’s small-scale broiler production’s economic viability and effectiveness. Furthermore, it is clear that small-scale broiler producers have the ability to increase their economic efficiency. By reducing the mortality rate, feed conversion rate, and production duration, both their technical and financial efficiency could be improved. Profitability in the production of broilers will be considerably increased by lowering the cost of these variable inputs, particularly feed and day-old chicks. Additionally, raising the education level, capacity utilization ratio, and broiler production would all contribute to raising the farms’ efficiency levels. To ensure effective resource use and to maximize practicable profit, small-scale broiler producers who are not operating close to the profit frontier must make efforts to reduce both technical and allocation inefficiencies. Collectively, all these measures would ensure the economic sustainability of small-scale farmers in South Africa would be met. Moreover, the sustainability of small-scale broiler producers can be achieved if strategies that build local capacity and that empower them to sustain high levels of productivity are provided. In addition, the efficient use of resources will ensure that productivity is enhanced, and might increase profitability. It is therefore important to ensure that small-scale broiler producers achieve maximum profit for a given set of inputs. Approaches in assessing the farm-level profitability such as cost-benefit and gross margin analyses can be used.

T1  - Impact of COVID-19 on Smallholder Aquaculture Farmers and Their Response Strategies: Empirical Evidence from Bangladesh
AN  - 2775029477
AB  - Bangladesh’s aquaculture sector has contributed progressively to the nation’s economy over the years, but the COVID-19 pandemic has impeded fish farmers’ access to markets, reduced their production and sales capacity, resulted in lower income, and increased food security vulnerability. This study assesses how COVID-19 affects smallholder fish farmers and their response strategies by employing data collected from 250 fish farmers and traders from intensive fish-growing areas of Bangladesh. The results reveal that most farmers experienced difficulty obtaining inputs, and the price of those inputs skyrocketed during the COVID-19 period, resulting in several months of decreased production and operations. As a result of COVID-19, farm gate prices for silver carp, ruhu, common carp, grass carp, and tilapia fish dropped by 25%, 23%, 23%, 22%, 23%, and 40%, respectively. On the other hand, fish feed prices were found to increase significantly. Reduced income from fish farming and other sources has triggered a significant drop in capital for farming operations and production capacity improvement, leading to food insecurity. The most common coping strategies include reduced buying from the market (vegetables, fruits, meat, milk, etc.), relying on less expensive or less preferred food, purchasing food on credit, and selling assets. Notably, due to COVID-19, a new mode of marketing has evolved as an adaptation strategy in the fish marketing system, such as the use of the mobile phone (18%) and Facebook/internet to sell fish directly to the customer (16%). The sector requires short-term financial assistance to assist fish actors with production and marketing challenges.

T1  - Food Purchase from Family Farming in Public Institutions in the Northeast of Brazil: A Tool to Reach Sustainable Development Goals
AN  - 2775010364
AB  - The purchase of food from family farming in public institutions in Brazil was boosted by the implementation of the public call modality. The National School Feeding Program—PNAE— and the Food Acquisition Program—PAA— are world references in terms of purchasing food from family farming. However, hindrances are still observed regarding the participation of small farmers in public purchase of food, reducing their participation and scope of the food products available. Using a cross-sectional approach, this study analyzed food from family farming purchased by federal institutes of education located at the northeast region of Brazil to characterize the profile of family farmers participating on public calls, identify the food required and verify the processing level of food present into these documents. The data obtained indicate that family farmers supply mainly in natura or minimally processed foods, especially fruits. Meat and meat products were not present and processed foods, such as cheese, were not purchased extensively from family farmers by federal institutes, even when farmers were grouped into cooperatives and associations. Failure to comply with sanitary requirements required in the public call process was the main reason for the non-homologation of some food from family farming. The data found in this study show that despite the advances that allowed the purchase of food from family farming in public educational institutions, it is necessary to find ways to increase the diversity of food. Investing in improving structural conditions would be a way to increase the quality and diversity of food provided by family farming in public institutions, contributing to the environmental, social, and health dimensions of sustainability.

T1  - Fresh Product Supply Chain Analysis in Cauca, Colombia — A Hass Avocado System Dynamics Approach
AN  - 2767288418
AB  - In recent years, agriculture has become an essential activity in Colombia, despite the challenges faced by farmers due to low yields and insufficient resources to improve their main activities, such as irrigation systems, agricultural practices, and industrial machinery. This Hass avocado approach has been addressed in previous research considering system dynamics simulation to evaluate farmers’ behavior strategies and improve their competitiveness. However, these studies typically examine a single strategy effect and avoid multiple integrated strategies. Other studies focused on the complex interactions between different factors in the production chain and their feedback effects on farmers’ productivity and cash flow. For these reasons, this research provides a comprehensively dynamic model and evaluates long-term strategies and their effects on supporting and improving small farmers’ productivity and profitability. A system dynamics methodology was used to model complex systems processing Hass avocado farmer association data and explore their effects on competitiveness for long-term sustainable and profitable agriculture. This research proposes optimal scenarios for small farmers, including strategies such as low-interest credit access, logistics practices, and government technical support. The scenarios provide a proactive tool for decision makers and promote rural farmers’ development, aligning high-quality fresh product supply and demand.

T1  - Upscaling Groundnut Seed Production and Delivery through Long-Term Public–Private and Development Organization Partnerships: Experiences from Tanzania
AN  - 2767177704
AB  - Making quality seed of improved legume varieties sustainably available and accessible to farmers in a timely manner and at affordable price is a major challenge in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Overcoming this challenge requires collective and long-term action through public–private and development organization partnerships (PPDOPs). The PPDOP model was tested by key seed system actors under the Tropical Legumes (TL) and Accelerated Varietal Improvement and Seed Delivery of Legumes and Cereals in Africa (AVISA) projects from 2008 to 2021. The study used the case of groundnut in Tanzania to assess the role played by long-term PPDOPs in groundnut seed production and delivery systems. The effectiveness of seed production and delivery models of the various actors involved in the TL and AVISA projects was analyzed. The study used secondary data obtained from annual reports, unpublished and published literature, and institutional websites. The PPDOP model brought about significant changes to the seed systems. It was found that sustained seed production and delivery over a decade enhanced the performance of the groundnut value chain in Tanzania. Under the TL and AVISA projects, a total of 49,046 tons of groundnut from different seed classes were produced through PPDOPs, covering an estimated 613,078 hectares with improved groundnut varieties. The intervention reached 45,201 stakeholders through 3048 demonstration plots, 128 field days, 55 seed fairs, and 8147 tons of small seed packs of 1–5 kg. The study recommends the use of long-term PPDOPs in seed production and delivery systems for greater impacts on increased variety adoption and consistent seed supply and availability in SSA. Long-term PPDOPs ensure proper coordination, open communication, clear accountability, solid trust, and standardized practices among actors in seed production and delivery systems.

T1  - Public–private partnership generates economic benefits to smallholder bean growers in Uganda
AN  - 2766755987
AB  - The quest to transform and hasten the role of smallholder farms in agricultural development and food security through farmer-firm linkages has dominated development interventions in low-income countries for several decades. This has mostly been pursued through single- or multi-contract schemes implemented in isolation. Several studies have analyzed the effects of these schemes on smallholder farms with mixed results. A new paradigm is to use Agricultural Public Private Partnership (Ag-PPP) to achieve wider and sustainable impacts. However, limited empirical evidence exists on the effects of Ag-PPP interventions and targeting the same farmer. We address this research gap by assessing the impact of an Ag-PPP on small-scale common bean producers in Uganda. We use a doubly robust difference-in-difference approach in a multi-treatment setting to estimate these impacts. The results show that the PPP created positive outcomes for farmers and stimulated increased production from targeted interventions. Evidence shows that the PPP and its interventions were associated with significant increases in productivity, sales volumes, and shares of output marketed. Receiving bundled interventions had greater effects than a single intervention and effects varied between men and women bean crop owners. Results suggest that providing bundled interventions through a PPP can increase productivity and alleviate market access constraints. The outcomes of this Ag-PPP could be modified for other contexts i.e., crops and localities, to inform food and development policy elsewhere.

T1  - Effect of on-farm testing on adoption of banana production technologies among smallholder farmers in Meru region, Kenya
AN  - 2766586963
AB  - Purpose>The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of on-farm testing on the adoption of banana production technologies among smallholder farmers in the Meru region, Kenya.Design/methodology/approach>The study adopted a pragmatic paradigm and a cross-sectional survey design, sampling 370 and 30 farmers proportionately from 269,499 to 19,303 smallholder banana farmers in Meru and Tharaka-Nithi Counties of Kenya, respectively.Findings>The study revealed that there was an association between belonging to a banana farming testing group and the adoption of banana technology. The study also revealed that most farmers were not interested in adopting banana technologies as they preferred the use of conventional methods, due to unstable market prices, lack of subsidized banana production input, inaccessibility to technological materials, few extension experts and lack of enough demonstrations.Research limitations/implications>Some respondents were not willing to freely offer the information required for this study. This was delimited by assuring the informants of the confidentiality of their responses.Originality/value>The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. The agricultural extension service providers will have more light on the underlying issues that need to be considered if meaningful interventions are to be done on various aspects of the banana value chain.

T1  - Fijian food shopping behaviour: implications for policy makers and smallholder farmers
AN  - 2766586914
AB  - Purpose>The study aims to identify different consumer groups to better understand changes in urban Fijian food shopping behaviour and the implications for the local food industry.Design/methodology/approach>The authors used a Latent class (LC) cluster analysis of survey data from 1,000 urban Fijian households to identify unique consumer segments based on household food shopping behaviour.Findings>Five distinct urban household clusters were identified based on food shopping behaviour. The cluster with the highest income level spent significantly lower amounts on fresh fruit and vegetables (FFV) at the main traditional market, preferring to buy their FFV from modern supermarket outlets. Considering the vast majority of local smallholder farmers rely on traditional market channels to sell their produce, the growth and dominance of Fijian supermarkets are of some concern.Research limitations/implications>Future research should consider repeating these types of detailed consumer surveys to better understand the implications of changes in shopping behaviour over time, and the role that key stakeholders can play in ensuring smallholder farmers is not excluded from the market.Social implications>Smallholder-driven agriculture accounts for a significant share of Fiji's gross domestic product (GDP), so understanding how the retail food industry is transforming and how this is affecting smallholder farmers is critical to Fiji's social structure.Originality/value>Research on food retailing and the role of the consumer is rare in small island developing states (SIDS), such as Fiji. Fiji has a somewhat unique set of circumstances. In the absence of significant foreign investment in food retailing, key factors such as urbanisation and rising urban income mean consumer preferences are important drivers of changes in shopping behaviour. The study provides insights into Fiji's changing food industry with implications for other SIDS, while contributing to the global literature in this field.

T1  - Enabling socially responsible operations: A decision-making model for a firm contracting with decision-biased smallholders
AN  - 2763162562
AB  - Small farmers in emerging economies face numerous constraints, including financial distress and limited access to profitable markets. Thus, procurement contracts having provisions for resource inputs are essential in linking them to the mainstream agri-supply chains. Consequently, we frame a decision-making model for a risk-neutral firm offering advance payment contracts to such credit-constrained smallholders. The firm allows them to commit their supply quantities and pays a fraction of the per-unit guaranteed price for the crop as advance. Behaviorally, the decision-biased farmers are loss-averse and hyperbolic discounters. They have a subjective perception of crop yield based on the (timing of) advance. Our model establishes a criterion for the firm to shortlist the farmers for contracting. Subsequently, it predicts their commitment quantities under limited information on their behavioral parameters using the Prospect Theory framework. Under the model assumptions, we calculate the upper and lower bounds on their commitment quantities, thereby establishing the limits on the firm’s production quantity and profitability. Lastly, our model determines the optimal timing for paying the advances to the eligible farmers using two different strategies. The first favors a firm’s profit maximization objective, while the second maximizes its marginal cost savings from contracting over spot buying. Through analytical and numerical calculations, we establish that the latter approach significantly raises the farmers’ utilities without severely affecting the firm’s profit. Thus, making it fit for a social entrepreneur on a mission to create a socially responsible and economically viable procurement strategy.

T1  - Unlocking the Land Capability and Soil Suitability of Makuleke Farm for Sustainable Banana Production
AN  - 2761216571
AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is experiencing an increase in food insecurity, which is fueled by both high population growth and low agricultural productivity. Smallholder farmers are seriously affected by low soil fertility, land degradation, and poor agronomic management practices that reduce crop productivity. Therefore, there is a huge need for reliable soil information to support agricultural decision-making in smallholder farms to ensure sustainable agricultural production. However, most studies focused on land capability and soil suitability do not consider the spatial variability of soils and their inherent properties. The main objectives of this study were (1) to survey, classify and characterise soils at Makuleke farm in order to derive and map the land capability classes and (2) to quantify the physical and chemical properties of the soils in order to derive and map the suitability classes. A field survey and classification of soils led by transect walks complemented by auger holes revealed existential spatial variation of soils across the 12 ha banana plantation. The dominating soil forms in the plantation were Hutton, Westleigh, Glenrosa and Valsrivier. Land capability analysis revealed that 17% of the 12 ha portion of the farm had very high arable potential, while 60% had medium arable potential, 6% of the farm had low arable potential and 17% was considered non-arable. Subsequent soil suitability analysis revealed that 12% of the farm is highly suitable, 34% is moderately suitable, 38% is marginally suitable and 16% is permanently not suitable for banana production. The variable capability of the land and suitability of soils for banana production led to notable yield gaps. The in-depth description and quantification of the productive capacity of the land is pivotal to the farmers at Makuleke farm as it unlocks their true potential and such information is crucial to effectively manage the soil and utilize the land for sustainable banana production.

T1  - The Influence of Government Regulation on Farmers’ Green Production Behavior—From the Perspective of the Market Structure
AN  - 2761186289
AB  - To clarify the factors influencing the green production behavior of peach farmers, this paper uses the survey data of 741 peach farmers in 19 provinces and cities in China, it uses a multiple ordered probit model to empirically analyze the impact of the government regulations on the green production behavior of peach farmers, from the perspective of the market structure. This paper also analyzes its intermediary role in this process, and it analyzes the possible heterogeneity at both the planting scale and the regional level. The results show the following: (1) Government regulation has a positive and significant impact on the green production behavior of peach farmers. Specifically, government supervision and inspection, alongside green subsidies, can positively promote the implementation of green production behavior by peach farmers, but government publicity and training have not played a good role. (2) The market structure plays a partial intermediary role, rather than a complete intermediary role, in the government regulation affecting the green production behavior of peach farmers. (3) The impact of the government regulation on the green production behavior of peach farmers is heterogeneous. Specifically, compared with small farmers, the impact on large-scale farmers is higher; however, the influence of the three methods of government regulation on the green production behavior of peach farmers varies from region to region. Therefore, in order to promote the implementation of green production, the government should introduce appropriate local policies, strongly support new agricultural business entities, draw clear guidelines for the market, and play the role of “night watchman”.

T1  - EFFECT OF MARKET ACCESS ON THE MODERNISATION OF SMALLHOLDER WOMEN AGRO-FOOD ENTERPRISES IN FREE STATE PROVINCE, SOUTH AFRICA
AN  - 2793115266
AB  - The study's main objective was to develop an empirical model that could be used to ensure that market access interventions could positively influence the change of these enterprises. The quantitative data were collected using the survey method, while the qualitative data were collected using the focus group sessions. The results showed that market access is highly correlated (r = 0.482, p = 0.000) with business ownership and moderately correlated with management control. The results suggested that when business ownership, management control, and representative are included in the model with market access, market access has minor but positively significant (β=0.059, p = 0.05) role to influence the smallholder women's transformation agro-food enterprise. However, its effect on change is seen to the lowest compared to the confounding variables. These results imply that market access is not the highest priority in effecting this farming system's transformation, rather business ownership, representation, and management control. For the Free State province to modernize this farming system, it is recommended that the extension services should dwell more on ensuring that the women farmers have ownership of land, representation in the value chain, and the management of the corporates dealing with market access.

T1  - Smallholders' livelihoods in the presence of commercial farms in central Kenya
AN  - 2778060865
AB  - We study smallholder households livelihood profiles in central Kenya in an area characterized by the presence of many large commercial farms. We surveyed 375 smallholder households, compared them according to three categories (employed, contract farmers, households non-engaged with commercial farms), and constructed a livelihood index. The results show that contract farmers and households employed on farms are only a small fraction of all smallholders. Employed and non-employed households show little difference in overall livelihood profiles. Results suggest that employment on large commercial farms is mainly a coping strategy for younger households or in times of need. Contract farmers were found only in a specific location and had better access to irrigation water and higher livestock holdings. Comparison with earlier data shows the persistence of precarious livelihood levels and household strategies aiming at diversification of activities, with little evolution over the last 20 years despite the presence of commercial farms. Overall, there is little evidence that the proximity to the commercial farms offers a way out of poverty for nearby smallholder farmers.

T1  - Caprine milk as a source of income for women instead of a taboo: a comparative analysis of the implication of women in the caprine and bovine value chains in Fatick, Senegal
AN  - 2756866252
AB  - Domestic animals, especially small ruminants, are an important source of income for millions of smallholder farmers, particularly women, in Senegal. The aim of this study was to understand the place of the bovine and caprine milk value chains and to identify the role and challenges for women in the Fatick livestock production sector. A survey was conducted among a sample of 50 female producers, including 30 and 20 from the bovine and caprine milk value chains, respectively. Descriptive statistics were performed to compare the caprine and bovine milk value chains in terms of activities, products, and implications for household incomes while showing the place of women at different links of these value chains. The result of the study showed that the bovine milk value chain provided higher income compared to the caprine’s, but the latter was found to be more diverse in terms of milk-derived products with increased income opportunities’ potential. Remoteness, lack of equipment, and cultural biases were reported to be the main constraints in the caprine value chain, while milk price fluctuations were reported to be the biggest challenge for producers in the bovine milk value chain. Access to land and government subsidy programs and domestic time management were the main and specific challenges affecting women in the bovine and caprine value chains. Therefore, there is a need for the establishment of policies and interventions that consider the needs, opportunities, and complementarity offered by both the caprine and bovine milk value chains across smallholder women settings, while putting gender mainstreaming at the center of the discussions and reforms.

AN  - 2755673124
AB  - Private actors are essential partners in the sustainability governance of commodity-supply chains such as palm oil. However, their actual contribution to promoting sustainability is also contested. This article assesses the role of private actors in the governance of the palm oil-supply chain in Thailand by comparing supply-chain actors that are certified with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) standards and non-certified supply-chain actors. The comparison entails input supply and production, collection and sales, processing and storage, and distribution. Building on the concept of (global) value chains, we examine the following governance dimensions in our comparison: the management of contracts and agreements, the role of trust in transactions, the relative power of various actors, and the control over smallholder farmers’ access to the market. Primary data were collected in the Surat Thani and Krabi Provinces in southern Thailand. We found that the RSPO-certified palm-oil chain was shorter, more transparent, and that farmers received higher prices than the non-RSPO-certified chains.

T1  - A review on participation of cocoa smallholders in agricultural certification scheme
AN  - 2753717854
AB  - The ability of cocoa smallholders to comply with the agricultural certification scheme has led to the improvement of commodity profits in agriculture, especially cocoa crops. This study aims to determine the participation of cocoa smallholders in agricultural certification schemes. Cocoa production contributes to the national economy by generating exchange profits. Factors such as the age of smallholders, gender, training, farming experience, education, and attitude influence the smallholder’s participation in the agricultural certification scheme. Educational status had a significant positive relationship with the certification scheme. Based on the review, the multinomial logistic regression model and other methods are used to analyse smallholders’ participation in the certification. Therefore, the certification has some benefits for smallholders in terms of food safety standards. Consequently, it can improve the safety of the consumer, the livelihood of smallholders, and the quality of agricultural products. This capacity will locate the cocoa crops at the global demand linked together from top to down of the value chain process.

T1  - Understanding variability in carbon footprint of smallholder dairy farms in the central highlands of Ethiopia
AN  - 2743817832
AB  - Abstract Smallholder dairy farms face enormous challenges in increasing milk production while mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thereby enhancing climate resilience. The carbon footprint (CF) of smallholder milk production is expected to increase with increasing demand for dairy products under the business-as-usual scenario. This study estimates the carbon footprint of smallholder milk production and examines variation across farms using data from 480 households to identify viable options for mitigating GHG emissions. We applied a cradle to farm-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to examine the effects of farming systems on GHG emission intensities across intensification gradients of smallholder farms (SHF) from four potential dairy districts in the central highlands of Ethiopia. According to our findings, enteric fermentation was the primary source of GHG emissions, and methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management accounted for the majority of total emissions across farms. The estimated average CF varies depending on farming systems, global warming potential (GWP), and allocation methods used. When GHG emissions were allocated to multiple products using economic allocation and based on IPCC (2007) and IPCC (2014) GWPs, the overall average CF of milk production was 1.91 and 2.35 kg CO2e/kg fat and protein-corrected milk (FPCM), respectively. On average, milk accounted for 72% of total greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of farm typology, rural SHF systems produced significantly more CF per kg of milk than urban and peri-urban SHF systems. Variations in milk yield explained more than half of the variation in GHG emissions intensity at the farm level. Feed digestibility and feed efficiency had a negative and significant (P < 0.01) association with CF of SHF. Our findings suggested that improving feed digestibility and feed efficiency by increasing the proportion of concentrate and improved forage as well as chemically upgrading straw and crop residue could provide an opportunity to both increase milk yield and reduce the CF of milk production of SHF in the study area. Supporting SHF to realize strategies contributing to climate-resilient dairy development require interventions at several levels in the dairy value chain.

T1  - Are smallholder farmers benefiting from malt barley contract farming engagement in Ethiopia?
AN  - 2737609671
AB  - BackgroundIt is believed that in Ethiopia barley has been cultivated before 3000BC. Among the cereals, it is ranked in fifth place and the most important crop next to teff, sorghum, and wheat in the country. Different works of literature highlight that engagement in contract farming is one of the innovations promoted to tackle technology constraints of the smallholder farmers, as a possible solution to raising productivity and linking smallholders in the emerging modern marketing chains. Associated with the rapid rate of urbanization in the country, there is a high demand for malt barley which is resulting high expansion of beer factories. Consequently, in the study area, many farmers got into a contract agreement with Assela malt barley factories. Recent studies conducted on malt barley in Ethiopia gave much emphasis to the value chain aspect of malt barley. Therefore, the main motive behind this study was to fill the empirical literature gap in the field by giving much emphasis on the impact assessment of malt barley contract arrangement on income and food items dietary diversity of the respondent households.MethodologyTo attain the study objectives, both primary and secondary data were collected and used. Randomly selected 312 households comprising 127 households engaged in malt barley contract farming arrangements and 185 non-contract households were the source of primary data for this study. Secondary data were collected from a review of different works of literature. Both descriptive and econometric models were used to analyze the primary data using Stata software version 14. The propensity score matching model was applied to examine the impact of malt barley contract farming engagement on the income and dietary diversity of the respondents.ResultIt was found that family size, credit use, livestock holding, malt barley production experience, frequency of extension contact, and land allotted for malt barley production positively determine the probability of participation in malt barley contract farming arrangement. Contrary to this, distance to the malt barley collection centers negatively determine the probability of participation in malt barley contract farming. The ATT estimation of the PSM indicated that participation in malt barley contract farming has a positive impact on the income and dietary diversity of the respondent households.ConclusionParticipation in contract farming had a positive and significant impact on the annual income and dietary diversity of the smallholder households. The sensitivity analysis result showed that the impact results estimated by this study are insensitive to unobserved selection bias and the result obtained shows the true impact of contract farming on the income of the households. Therefore, concerned bodies working on malt barley production aspects as a development intervention should work to encourage non-contract farmers to engage in this activity.

T1  - Beyond household income: the role of commercial vegetable farming in moderating socio-cultural barriers for women in rural Nepal
AN  - 2729509624
AB  - BackgroundPromoting rural women’s agricultural entrepreneurship in the Global South has become a major policy and program priority for governments and development partners. Women’s income earning is viewed as a pathway to their empowerment and gender equality. The research goal was to understand how patriarchal socio-cultural norms and practices influence women’s participation in commercial vegetable farming (CVF) in the mid-hills of Sudurpashchim Pradesh, Nepal, and identify the specific and evolving strategies that women use to negotiate these changes.MethodologyData for the study were generated through in-depth interviews with 16 smallholder couples, eight each in Dadeldhura and Achham districts. Additionally, 17 key informants who were government agency and development organization agriculture support officials at the district and national level were interviewed. Besides in-depth interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs) with women’s groups, women leaders, development actors, and government officials at district, regional, and national level were also conducted. Interview data analysis using NVivo was complemented with field notes, observations and government agency and development organization reports.ResultsCVF possibilities initially motivated a few women to discuss with their husbands, organize self-help groups, and seek development program subsidies. With strong support from husbands and parents-in-law, they actively engage in CVF, generate income, form cooperatives for savings and credit, and improve household food security and their own economic status. CVF-associated groups, cooperatives, meetings, exposure visits, skill development training, knowledge sharing, counseling, and advocacy are vital tools. Through them, women build self-confidence, contest and transform entrenched socio-cultural barriers, and negotiate new socio-cultural norms and practices within and outside the household. Dissolving gender stereotypes regarding the division of labor in CVF plays a significant role in encouraging more women to join CVF and increases gender parity. However, a diminishing minority of women still struggle to overcome the legacy of prior negative experiences and subconsciously fear community backlash, especially regarding extended travel outside their village.ConclusionSocio-cultural practices restricting women’s income-generating roles can be transformed through investment in women’s group initiatives, enhancing husbands’ and wives’ communication and livelihood planning, and community members increased appreciation for women’s role in contributing household income and food security.

T1  - Determinants of market participation among smallholder farmers in Southwest Ethiopia: double-hurdle model approach
AN  - 2729509443
AB  - BackgroundAgricultural production by smallholder farm households is a means of livelihood for many rural households in developing economies, including Africa. Commercializing smallholder farmers in the agricultural sector is an indispensable path to boost economic growth and development of most developing countries, like Ethiopia. But, maize marketing has not been given due attention, which has potential production volume and marketability. Therefore, this study is designed to identify determinants of market participation decision and volume of supply among smallholder maize producer farmers in Southwest Ethiopia.MethodsData for this study were collected through cross‑sectional survey from maize producer farm households. The primary data were generated by household survey using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. A both purposive and random sampling technique was used to draw an appropriate sample of 546 maize producer households for this cross-sectional survey study. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and double-hurdle econometric model.ResultsThe result of the survey indicates that out of total 546 maize producers, 381 households are maize market participants and 165 households are non-participants. First hurdle model results show that nine variables—education level, farming experience, quantity of maize produced, cooperative membership, distance to nearest market, amount of credit received, off/non-farming income, number of oxen and perception about lagged price—significantly affect the market participation decision among maize producer farmers. The second hurdle result confirmed that seven variables—sex, family size, land allocated for maize, number of oxen, distance to nearest market, livestock holding and perception about lagged price—significantly affect the level of market participation by maize producer farmers.ConclusionThe findings of this study revealed that understanding the factors and its extent is very important for policy-making to address the problem of market participation decision and level of participation among smallholder farm households. Therefore, the study suggests that important resource and socio-economic factors must take into consideration to enhance the productivity and strength supportive institutions or infrastructural facilities in the study area to improve market participation decision and level of participation of smallholders.

T1  - Socio-Economic Characterisation of Resettled Smallholder Farmers in Rural Zimbabwe
AN  - 2727370692
AB  - The socio-economic characterisation of resettled small-holder farmers under the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP) in Zimbabwe has blind spots in relation to the emergent transformative social policy features such as ‘social cohesion’, ‘cooperation’, ‘protection’ and ‘accumulation’ which are equally important among land beneficiaries. Using the Sangwe farm, this article departs from the conventional use of the political economy, sustainable livelihoods, human rights-based and neo-patrimonial approaches to experiment with the transformative social policy approach. Using both quantitative and qualitative data in an exploratory research design, the article shows that viewed from the transformative social policy approach, the FTLRP was neither a resounding success nor a complete disaster. The programme actually produced mixed results. The article thus, recommends the use of in-depth, ideologically free and neutral approaches in its analysis so as to reveal its detailed outcomes. Additional studies in which existing land reform policies can be considered in the collective efforts of improving the transformative agenda of the FTLRP across the country are needed.

T1  - Impacts of farmer cooperative membership on household income and inequality: Evidence from a household survey in China
AN  - 2678579650
AB  - While joining farmer cooperatives has been identified as a way for farmers, especially small farmers, to overcome their limitations in the marketplace and increase their income, this paper presents an analytical framework for examining how farmer cooperative may increase farmer income in rural China, empirically assesses the impacts of such membership on household income, and examines how the membership may affect income inequality. Data from a large-scale survey of rural households in China are used to examine the impacts of farmer cooperative membership and other factors on household income through a multivariate regression analysis and to test whether the impacts are different across income groups through a quantile regression analysis. The propensity score matching technique is used to address potential self-selection bias problems in the dataset and quantile regression is used to examine the impact for different income quantiles or groups of farmers. The empirical results indicate that farmers participating in professional cooperatives, on average, earned significantly higher income than their counterparts, but the positive impact was not statistically significant for low-income quantiles. This finding suggests that encouraging the development of and participation in farmer cooperatives could increase the average income but may not contribute directly to the policy goal of reducing income inequality in rural China.

T1  - Can producer groups improve technical efficiency among artisanal shrimpers in Nigeria? A study accounting for observed and unobserved selectivity
AN  - 2644218065
AB  - It is widely recognized that participation in producer groups is advantageous for smallholders who must deal with complex production and marketing constraints and dynamic business environments. However, available data on this process are scarce in the fishery sector, while existing evidence is limited by smallholders’ potential self-selection into producer groups. This study, therefore, examined the selectivity-corrected role of fisher groups in improving shrimpers’ technological and technical efficiency. Using the latest primary data from artisan shrimpers in Nigeria, we applied propensity score matching and Greene’s selectivity stochastic production frontier model to control for selection bias from both observable and unobservable factors. Empirical results from our metafrontier approach show that technical efficiency scores for members tend to be overestimated if selectivity is not properly controlled. However, the technical efficiencies and productivities of members were significantly higher regardless of how biases were corrected, implying that participation in fisher groups is positively related to increases in shrimpers’ capture and technical efficiency. Further findings suggest that current artisanal fisher groups are “production-oriented” as they ensure that members access vital shrimping inputs at lower costs. With declining returns to scale for members, the study concludes that without public and private support for collective action in the fishery sector, membership in artisanal fisher groups may not lead to significant improvement in shrimpers’ productivity. The study discusses several recommendations on how collective action can be further encouraged and developed among artisan fishers.

T1  - Effects of sustainable agricultural practices on farm income and food security in northern Ghana
AN  - 2638857853
AB  - The adoption of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) has been recommended by many experts and international institutions to address food security and climate change problems. Global support for the Sustainable Development Goals has focused attention on efforts to up-scale the adoption of SAPs in developing countries where growth in populations and incomes compromises the resilience of natural resources. This study investigates the factors affecting smallholder farmers’ decisions to adopt SAPs (improved seed, fertilizer, and soil and water conservation) and the impacts of the adoption on farm income and food security, using data collected from Ghana. Food security is captured by the reduced coping strategy index and household dietary diversity. The multinomial endogenous switching regression model is utilized to address selection bias issues. Results show that farmers’ decisions to adopt SAPs are influenced by the social demographics of the households, plot-level characteristics, extension services and locations. Adopting all three SAPs has larger positive impacts on farm income and food security than adopting single or two SAPs. Our findings advocate for policies that enhance the quality of extension service and strengthen farmer-based organizations for the wider dissemination of adequate SAP information. Farmers should be encouraged to adopt SAPs as a comprehensive package for increasing farm income and ensuring food security.

T1  - Strengthening climate adaptation in the northern region of Ghana: insights from a stakeholder analysis
AN  - 2735405692
AB  - Climate change significantly impacts agriculture. Building an informed and collaborative process among stakeholders remains vital in minimizing climate risks and building climate-adaptive and resilient agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, stakeholders’ involvement and collaboration in agriculture decision-making are framed by institutional, power, and resource dynamics, often ignoring vulnerable stakeholders most susceptible to climate shocks. These collaborative dynamics are less studied in the climate adaptation literature, especially in the context of Ghana and SSA. This study promotes stakeholder engagement and collaboration in climate-adaptive and conservation agriculture (CA) by examining the influence of and relationship dynamics among key stakeholders in the northern region of Ghana (NRG). Drawing from the normative stakeholder theory and literature on climate adaptation intervention, we use multiple qualitative research methods (e.g. brainstorming, semi-structured interviews, and focus group sessions) to profile and explore stakeholders’ roles, interests, and collaboration in CA and adaptation interventions. Our findings suggest that collaborations in CA in these smallholder farming communities are often fragmented, providing few collaboration advantages to smallholder farmers. Where collaboration occurs, it is often characterized by redundancy or duplication of roles and functions performed by stakeholders, poor coordination among key government actors, or by conflictual relationships among non-governmental organizations (NGOs); relationships amongst stakeholders are often driven by conflicting interests and asymmetric power differentials. These findings suggest that measures to engage stakeholders must carefully consider aligning stakeholders’ interests and addressing power differentials, which are necessary to minimize conflicts in collaborative governance arrangements for adaptation and CA.Key policy insightsConservation agriculture (CA) creates resilient agricultural systems for enhanced food security and poverty alleviation.Stakeholder roles, interests, and collaborations should be identified to understand who should be included to establish a collaborative connection for adaptation planning.Policymakers should actively engage stakeholders, including smallholder farmers, in the design and implementation of climate adaptation planning and interventions. As the principal resource for adaptation planning and decision-making is the people themselves, engaging them will leverage their knowledge, experiences, and expertise for the design of effective adaptation policies and ensure effective implementation.Collaborative action involving stakeholders can promote effective action on climate change by fostering consensus and building local ability and expertise to collectively adopt adaptation measures.

T1  - Sugarcane Commercialization and Gender Experiences in the Zambian “Sweetest Town”
AN  - 2723653134
AB  - This article explores how sugarcane commercialization impacts gender relations, and processes that shape them, using two differently structured outgrower schemes – a settlement scheme and an European Union-driven block farm in southern Zambia. Results show gendered impacts across the schemes are complex and are shaped by diverse cultural arrangements as micro-processes. Intrahousehold patterns of decision making, land, and labor dynamics reveal that changing the structure, organization, and integration of outgrower schemes does not necessarily make them responsive to strategic gender needs. Further, these processes are insufficient in altering pre-existing sociocultural imbalances. Consequently, even where schemes are intentional about being inclusive, they are likely to replicate structural inequalities and fail to engender transformational changes among participants. This article raises the need to address the politics of land and labor relations, and their implications for different social groups within their cultural-historical context.HIGHLIGHTSGendered impacts of commercial agriculture reflect market and nonmarket dynamics.Schemes amplify preexisting inequalities despite being intentional on inclusivity.Land ownership shapes women’s responses and political reactions in schemes.Inheritance patterns may address land inequalities but more needs to be done.Addressing strategic gender needs requires market and nonmarket interventions.

T1  - Paradoxes of Inclusion: Adverse Effects of Inclusive Interventions in Northern Ethiopia
AN  - 2723294955
AB  - The involvement of smallholders in various inclusive business models (IBMs) is being widely promoted in Ethiopia. The inclusion, exclusion and distribution effects of IBMs must be better understood, however, in order to make them more impactful. This study, which was carried out in three districts in northern Ethiopia, employed a mixed methods approach. Our results show that inclusion and exclusion are both complex and multidimensional. A focus on transaction costs, productive resource endowments and chain governance is crucial for enhancing smallholders’ inclusion. Our results further indicate that income obtained from participation in IBMs is unequally distributed. The benefits of IBMs vary according to the underlying position of the smallholder. Hence, inclusive development interventions should acknowledge the various positions of smallholders and consider how their positions shape social relations locally. The paper thus reveals the various dimensions, contradictory tendencies, hidden costs and side effects of IBMs.

T1  - Partnerships Blending Institutional Logics for Inclusive Global and Regional Food Value Chains in Ghana; with What Smallholder Effect?
AN  - 2723294711
AB  - We witness a promotion of hybrid partnerships, where actors with different competences and resources collaborate for smallholder inclusive value chain development. To better understand the functioning of these partnerships, we used institutional theory and studied the context of a global and emerging regional food value chains in Ghana, the blending of logics by key actors in Innovation Platforms and Public Private Partnerships, and their effect on value chain relations of smallholder farmers. In the global value chain of cocoa, partnerships adhered to ‘green revolution’ and ‘free-market’ logics, and provided all farmers material support. In the more informally organised regional food sector, local executing partners selectively coupled their logics with those of poor smallholders, who rely on low-input agriculture and solidarity logics to make ends meet. This improved the position and transaction costs of smallholders to participate in the value chain. Hence, it is more likely for partnerships to create smallholder inclusive governance in informally organised regional food value chains, than highly structured global value chains controlled by international buyers. To gain insight in the variety of political effects this triggers in different social–historical shaped farmer communities, households and actors, we recommend complementary local research from a critical institutional perspective.

T1  - The Global Contributions of Working Equids to Sustainable Agriculture and Livelihoods in Agenda 2030
AN  - 2725133188
AB  - Small farmers produce most food in low- and middle-income countries and most small farmers rely on directly or indirectly working equids (WE). The lack of methods and metrics for assessing the role of WE hampers realisation of WE contributions. Based on literature review and a survey of WE welfare experts, we propose a framework for optimising WE potential based on two axes of sustainable development goals (SDGs) and value chains. WE contribute especially to earning and sparing income (largely in food production) (SDG 1), but also have roles in accessing health and hygiene services and products (SDG 3 and 5), providing edible products (SDG 2), and benefiting women (SDG 6), with lesser contributions to other SDGs, notably climate action (SDG 13). Experts identified barriers to appropriate appreciation of WE contributions, in order to target actions to overcome them. They found WE are neglected because they belong to farmers who are themselves neglected; because information on WE is inadequate; and, because the unique nature and roles of WE means systems, policies, investors, markets and service providers struggle to cater for them. Harnessing WE to optimally contribute to sustainable development will require generating better evidence on their contributions to SDGs, ensuring better integration into ongoing efforts to attain SDGs, and building the WE capacity among development actors.

T1  - <i>Campylobacter</i> positivity and public health risks in live bird markets in Busia, Kenya: A value chain analysis
AN  - 2717600033
AB  - Live bird markets (LBMs) provide integral hubs for 95% of poultry produced for food. Surveillance systems in LBMs serving smallholder farmers in sub‐saharan Africa are often non‐functional, and data about public health risks and emerging pathogens are lacking. Studies in Kenya have reported 29–44% Campylobacter prevalence in poultry. We analysed such LBMs in Kenya for likely transmission of Campylobacter from poultry to humans. We conducted a cross‐sectional survey among 186 live poultry traders (LPTs) in 14 LBMs in a region with widespread backyard poultry systems. A pretested structured questionnaire was administered to all LPTs having regular contacts with poultry to gather market data and risk information on campylobacteriosis. Campylobacter was detected in individual cloacal cultures and identified through PCR. The median score obtained from the outcome of risk assessment dichotomized respondents into high and low risk categories. We performed logistic regression at 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare market characteristics and Campylobacter positivity to risk categories to identify LBM‐associated public health risks. Markets had a median of 13 traders, and mean age of 46.3 ± 13.7 years. Majority 162/186 (87.1%) were males. Market behavioural processes by LPTs varied: Only 58.6% LPTs held bird species separate; onsite slaughter (38.7%); encountered sick‐bird (93%) and dead‐bird (83%) amidst limited health inspection (31.2%). Campylobacter positivity in live birds was 43/112 (38.4%, 95% CI: 29.4–48.1). Risk information on campylobacteriosis was low 41/114 (36%, 95% CI: 27.2–45.5). Sanitary risks were related to accumulation of litter (adjusted prevalence odds ratio [aPOR]: 19.67, 95% CI: 3.01–128.52). Accessing hand‐wash facilities (aPOR: .32, 95% CI: .13–.78) and access to information (aPOR: .24, 95% CI: .09–.61) were protective. Sanitary risks were related to poor hygiene. LBMs could be central surveillance sites for Campylobacter. Public health authorities/actors should consider appropriate targeting to improve sanitary measures and Campylobacter control strategies.

T1  - Exploring the hurdles that remain for control of African swine fever in smallholder farming settings
AN  - 2717599816
AB  - To honour the 100 years anniversary of the first publication about African swine fever (ASF) a webinar with a particular focus on disease control in the smallholder sector was organized. This article is based on the webinar, summarizing the early history of ASF research, reflecting on the current global disease situation and bringing forward some suggestions that could contribute towards achieving control of ASF.The first description of ASF by R. Eustace Montgomery in 1921 laid the foundations for what we know about the disease today. Subsequent research confirmed its association with warthogs and soft ticks of the Ornithodoros moubata complex. During the latter half of the 21st century, exponential growth of pig production in Africa has led to a change in the ASF‐epidemiology pattern. It is now dominated by a cycle involving domestic pigs and pork with virus spread driven by people. In 2007, a global ASF epidemic started, reaching large parts of Europe, Asia and the Americas. In Europe, this epidemic has primarily affected wild boar. In Asia, wild boar, smallholders and industrialized pig farms have been affected with impact on local, national and international pig value chains. Globally and historically, domestic pigs in smallholder settings are most frequently affected and the main driver of ASF virus transmission. Awaiting a safe and efficacious vaccine, we need to continue focus on other measures, such as biosecurity, for controlling the disease. However, smallholders face specific challenges linked to poverty and other structural factors in implementing biosecurity measures that can prevent spread. Improving biosecurity in the smallholder sector thus remains an important tool for preventing and controlling ASF. In this regard, interdisciplinary research can help to find new ways to promote safe practices, facilitate understanding and embrace smallholders’ perspectives, engage stakeholders and adjust prevention and control policies to improve implementation.

T1  - One hundred years of African swine fever in Africa: Where have we been, where are we now, where are we going?
AN  - 2717599766
AB  - One hundred years have passed since the first paper on African swine fever (ASF) was published by Montgomery in 1921. With no vaccine, ineffectiveness of prevention and control measures and lack of common interest in eradicating the disease, ASF has proven to be one of the most devastating diseases because of its significant sanitary and socioeconomic consequences. The rapid spread of the disease on the European and Asian continents and its recent appearance in the Caribbean puts all countries at great risk because of global trade. The incidence of ASF has also increased on the African continent over the last few decades, extending its distribution far beyond the area in which the ancient sylvatic cycle is present with its complex epidemiological transmission pathways involving virus reservoirs in ticks and wild African Suidae. Both in that area and elsewhere, efficient transmission by infected domestic pigs and virus resistance in infected animal products and fomites mean that human driven factors along the pig value chain are the dominant impediments for its prevention, control and eradication. Control efforts in Africa are furthermore hampered by the lack of information about the size and location of the fast‐growing pig population, particularly in the dynamic smallholder sector that constitutes up to 90% of pig production in the region. A vaccine that will be both affordable and effective against multiple genotypes of the virus is not a short‐term reality. Therefore, a strategy for management of ASF in sub‐Saharan Africa is needed to provide a roadmap for the way forward for the continent. This review explores the progression of ASF and our knowledge of it through research over a century in Africa, our current understanding of ASF and what must be done going forward to improve the African situation and contribute to global prevention and control.

T1  - Settlement as a determinant for community’s resilience to local economic development in Ghana
AN  - 2714741292
AB  - Local Economic Development (LED) is the main anchor through which economic development is achieved by building entrepreneurial capacities and improving opportunities for economic growth and citizens’ quality of life, especially in rural settlements. In Ghana, the implementation of LED is under the Ministry of Local Government, Decentralization and Rural Development (MLDGRD) through the Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies (MMDAs) at the local level. The implementation of LED contributes significantly to Ghana’s economic growth, business creation, and employment generation. LED is therefore identified as essential to sustainable development and poverty reduction in rural settlements in Ghana. However, the challenges of poor implementation of the LED policy are financial constraints to implement LED activities at the local level, performance action of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) towards LED, and limited exploration of the sanitation value chain LED efforts at the local level. The poor capacity of small-medium micro enterprises (SMMEs) and smallholder farmers have often affected the successful implementation of LED activities at the local level. Hence, this paper seeks to identify the determinants for resilience in Local Economic Development in Ghana. The paper further provides an overview of the LED challenges in Ghana. Finally, this paper recommends appropriate theoretical frameworks that integrate the determinants for the resilience of Local Economic Development to address the identified challenges of LED, leading to poverty reduction in Ghana.

T1  - The grower-trader relationship: experiments with coffee value chain actors in Uganda
AN  - 2704771205
AB  - In this study, we explore the nature of the relationship between smallholder growers and local traders in the coffee value chain in Eastern Uganda. Analysing the results of two lab-in-the-field experiments (trust and dictator games), we highlight the complex relationship between these two value chain actors. We develop three competing hypotheses: (1) coffee growers will send more to fellow growers than local traders due to social identity and fairness motives as well as because of past opportunistic behaviour of traders (2) coffee growers will send more to traders to curry favour, and (3) growers will send growers and traders the same amount because in a relatively competitive market setting there is little room for opportunistic trader behaviour. We fail to reject our third hypothesis. Our results highlight the importance of fully understanding value chain actor relationships and contexts to better design interventions to improve rural markets.

T1  - Growing cotton to produce food: Unravelling interactions between value chains in southern Mali
AN  - 2699692061
AB  - MotivationMost transaction cost economic frameworks, commonly used to examine and explain the co‐ordination of agricultural transactions, use a linear approach for a single product transaction. This ignores the concurrence of multiple transactions by smallholder farmers in developing countries.PurposeThis study aims to understand co‐ordination among multiple product transactions by smallholder farmers and to identify ways to remove impediments to market participation. It develops an adapted transaction cost framework, considering contract types and forms of market participation as building blocks for co‐ordination structures.The framework was applied to explain co‐ordination structures between smallholders and buyers of cotton and cereals in southern Mali.Methods and approachTo make the framework operational, we did the following: (1) selected transaction characteristics; (2) elaborated benchmarks to describe the intensity of transactions; (3) identified co‐ordination structures; and (4) scored the intensity of transactions. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected.FindingsThe majority of farmers grew cotton and sold it to a parastatal company, the sole buyer, that also supported the provision of inputs. Inputs were used to grow not only cotton, but also cereals. Most farmers sold cereals on spot markets to collectors and traders.Using different structures allowed smallholders to obtain inputs and services, to pursue different income sources over the year, and to balance flexibility and security.Policy implicationsCollective organizations of smallholder farmers should be supported to improve their financial and managerial capacities to allow them to co‐ordinate better with buyers and input suppliers.Institutional innovations to better balance risks for smallholders and buyers deserve consideration. These innovations include crop insurance, long‐term credit, and warehouse receipts.

T1  - Women’s empowerment and intra-household gender dynamics and practices around sheep and goat production in South East Kenya
AN  - 2717763999; 2022-89029-001
AB  - Small ruminant production facets like decision-making, ownership, labour allocation, access to- and control over assets are gendered. This study investigates intra-household gender dynamics and practices around sheep and goat production among smallholder farmers in South East region of Kenya. A quantitative study was conducted on 358 dual-headed (married) households to generate gender-disaggregated data on ownership, decision-making and labour allocation around small ruminant production. Qualitative data was collected through focused group discussions to bring out the community perspectives. From the findings, the average number of small ruminants owned by the households as reported by men was slightly higher than women. The average number of small ruminants solely owned by men was significantly higher than by women. Men reported a relatively higher number of jointly owned small ruminants compared to women. More women than men reported that they could give as a gift, sell-off and slaughter jointly owned small ruminants without consulting their spouses. Small ruminants were considered the most important livestock asset in supporting a household’s livelihood by relatively more women than men. Men had more decision-making autonomy over jointly owned small ruminants compared to women. Production tasks around small ruminants such as feeding, watering, selling milk and cleaning housing structures were mostly performed by the women. Qualitative data identified men as the de facto owners of small ruminants with a higher power position in making the important production decisions. The study offers three implications on the design of livestock interventions to empower women, the interventions should ensure that; 1) women are not just owners of livestock assets but also share power and decision-making rights in all aspects of production, 2) production labour is shared equitably between men and women and, 3) women access benefits from livestock production even when animals are owned by men.

T1  - Economic Reforms and the Rise of Milk Mega Farms in Vietnam: Governing the Post-socialist Transition
AN  - 2723294982
AB  - Over the past 30 years, major economic reforms have deeply impacted the Vietnamese agro-food sector. In this study, we use the concept of “sociotechnical transition” to capture the multiple dimensions of this transformation. We focus in particular on the rapid emergence of the Vietnamese dairy industry. Up to the mid-2000s, the sector had been dominated by smallholder dairy farmers working in close collaboration with private milk processors and public services. This resulted in what we propose to call a “peasant” sociotechnical regime. In the late 2000s, the sector experienced a growing competition from agro-industries and mega farms holding several thousand cows. The role of smallholder producers has decreased and the sector has moved toward medium to large-scale producers. This new “corporate” regime profoundly modified the outcome of the post-socialist "transition". This case-study highlights important issues related to the governance of these rapid changes.

T1  - Socio-demographic, institutional and governance factors influencing adaptive capacity of smallholder irrigators in Zimbabwe
AN  - 2707848893
AB  - The provision of resilience and adaptation to climate change to smallholder irrigation communities is a critical component in implementing common pool resource management. Institutions in many smallholder irrigation schemes in developing countries are diverse and have potential to contribute to building climate resilience and improving livelihoods of smallholder irrigator. Human behaviour, institutional capacity and culture play important roles in shaping adaptive capacity of communities to climate change. Although much is known about how these contribute to this adaptive capacity, research focusing on their interaction is limited. In order to close this the gap, this study seeks to explore how socio-demographic, governance and institutional factors influence adaptive capacity in Exchange, Insukamini and Ruchanyu irrigation schemes. Questionnaire-based interviews, group discussions and key informant interviews were used for data collection. Adaptive capacity calculated using the livelihood vulnerability model was used as the dependent variable for this study. Ordinary least square regression was used to assess socio-demographic, institutional and governance factors influencing adaptive capacity in the smallholder irrigation scheme. The study reveals that adaptive capacity is influenced by age, gender, education, land tenure security, irrigation committee satisfaction, cooperatives, and interaction of factors. The link between age and gender were negatively moderated by awareness of irrigation policies, access to credit and land tenure security. Assessing factors influencing adaptive capacity help to improve the livelihoods of scheme farmers in the face of climate change.

T1  - Impacts of large-scale land acquisitions on smallholder agriculture and livelihoods in Tanzania
AN  - 2695509455
AB  - Improving agricultural productivity is a foundational sustainability challenge in the 21st century. Large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) have important effects on both well-being and the environment in the Global South. Their impacts on agricultural productivity and subsequent effects on farm incomes, food-security and the distribution of these outcomes across households remain under-investigated. In particular, prior studies do not sufficiently attend to the mechanistic nature of changes in household agricultural practices that affect LSLA outcomes. To address these challenges, we use a novel household dataset and a quasi-experimental design to estimate household-level changes in agricultural productivity and other LSLA outcomes in Tanzania. We use causal mediation analysis to assess how four common mechanisms—contract farming, land loss, market access and technology adoption around LSLAs—influence agricultural productivity. We find that households near LSLAs exhibit 20.2% (95% CI: 3.1%–37.3%) higher agricultural productivity, primarily due to increased crop prices and farmer selection of high-value crops. Importantly, the direction and magnitude of effect sizes associated with the different mechanisms vary. The presence of contract farming explains 18.1% (95% CI: 0.56%, 47%) of the effect size in agricultural productivity, whereas land loss reduces agricultural productivity by 26.8% (95% CI: −71.3%, −4.0%). Market access and technology adoption explain little to no portion of the effect size on agricultural productivity. Despite higher agricultural productivity mediated by contract farming, we do not find increased household incomes or food security. Plausible explanations include limited market access, higher crop prices restricting food access and elite capture of contract farming concentrating income effects to a few households. Our results stand in contrast to assumptions that technological spillovers occur through LSLAs and are the principal drivers of LSLA-induced agricultural transformation. We find instead that access to contract farming and high-value crops lead to greater agricultural productivity, but also that benefits related to these mechanisms are unequally distributed.

T1  - Characterization of production systems and management practices of the cattle population in Zambia
AN  - 2678580843
AB  - Abstract This study was an attempt at the analysis of the Zambia cattle population, its production systems and management practices using data collected during the 2017/2018 livestock and aquaculture census. The Public User Microdata Sample dataset provided by the Central Statistics Organization were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Traditional system and free range grazing were found to be the main production system and feeding practices (97.2%). Despite large expanse of arable land, crop and fodder production, there was poor integration with cattle production system thus predisposing the animal to poor productivity due to inadequate nutrition. The management practices were found to be limiting and a hindrance to improved performance. The study revealed diverse cattle genetic resources comprising of local and exotic breeds, and their crosses at different genetic proportions. The local breed crosses were mainly directed at exotic beef breeds (and evidence of crosses with exotic dairy breeds) as smallholder farmers tend to improve on the production performances and productivity. Disease prevalence was high and had been an impediment to the growth of the cattle industry. It was clear that cattle production development must be anchored on a value chain system approach. Efforts aimed at capacity building should be targeted at the smallholder farmers with the bulk (93.5%) of the cattle population. This should include impacting farmers with husbandry skills through provision of elaborate livestock extension services aimed at integrating crops and fodder production in feeding practices, communal grazing management and adequate access to veterinary services to control disease prevalence. Value addition and market development would be helpful in unlocking the potential of the beef meat and milk products industry.

T1  - Justice and Inclusiveness: The Reconfiguration of Global–Local Relationships in Sustainability Initiatives in Ghana’s Cocoa Sector
AN  - 2737958890
AB  - Pressure from the public and non-governmental organisations is pushing lead companies in the cocoa and chocolate sectors towards becoming more environmentally sustainable and socially just. Because of this, several sustainability programmes, certification schemes and delivery initiatives have been introduced. These have changed the relationship between chocolate companies, cocoa exporters, and small-scale farmers. This paper observes how large companies in the cocoa export and consumer markets are shifting away from their traditionally remote position in the cocoa sector. The pressure to ensure sustainability and justice has provoked more mutually dependent relationships with cocoa producers. Our analysis outlines the implications this emerging reconfiguration of global-local relationships has for procedural justice principles of interdependence and refutability, and the distributive justice principles of need and equity. These principles are important because they enable the different dimensions of inclusion: ownership, voice, risk, and reward. This paper highlights and qualifies arrangements surrounding these justice principles that manifest in the way five service delivery initiatives - associated with sustainability programmes and led by major buying companies in Ghana’s cocoa sector – are implemented. We show inclusiveness as an outcome of dynamic global-local relationships that are constantly reworked in response to smallholder farmers’ agency and state regulations. Portraying inclusiveness as an outcome of interactions changes its conceptualisation from a predefined ethical standpoint included in the design of standards to a result of unfolding mutual dependencies, which refashion how inclusive agriculture value chains work.

T1  - The THE IMPACT OF DAIRY COOPERATIVES ON MILK PRODUCERS' REVENUES OF IHUZA ABOROZI BA KIJYAMBERE BAFATANYINJE (IAKIB) IN GICUMBI DISTRICT OF RWANDA. APPLICATION OF PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING (PSM)
AN  - 2725342353
AB  - Dairy cooperatives should have a significant impact in the future in terms of regenerating rural life. The pressing need in the Cooperative sector in the era of liberalized environments is to seize every opportunity available for the country. Diary co-operatives mainly from cattle production played a vital role in our country's economy in the previous era and will do so in years to come. This study aims to assess the impact of dairy cooperatives on milk producers' revenues in the Gicumbi district of Rwanda. The total sample involved in this research was 974, from four cow milk producers, namely Bukure MCC-Cooperative d'Elevage Moderne de Bukure (COOPEMOBU), Koperative Zamuka Mworozi (KOZAMGI) and Borozi Twisungane Kabuga-Nyamiyaga and Giramata, which form the cooperative union of Ihuza Aborozi ba Kijyambere Bafatanyinje (IAKIB). The total sample size to be taken from three cooperatives and other recorded local farmers supplying their milk to the nearest Milk Collection Centres, as preselected, is 260 milk producers, including 187 participants and 73 non-participants of dairy cooperatives. The study used a descriptive survey design, encompassing three cooperatives and other dairy producers not members of cooperatives from Gicumbi district. Descriptive statistics, t-test, Standard Deviation, means, frequency and percentages, as well as a Propensity Score Matching model were used to analyse the results of the study. The study findings show that the average total gross revenue was 551,113 Rwandan francs for these farmers, while the mean difference between dairy cooperative participants and non-participants ranged from 50,146 Rwandan francs to 168,145 Rwandan francs as program impact. This is an indication that participants in dairy cooperatives gain more compared to their factual group. The study recommends that small holder dairy producers should be supported to enable them to produce surplus milk for markets and reduce local milking cow numbers by replacing them with crossbred cows. It is recommended that governments should also strengthen milk processing cooperatives and improve their infrastructure facilities to reduce the transportation cost for small-scale dairy producers.

T1  - A place at the table is not enough: Accountability for Indigenous Peoples and local communities in multi-stakeholder platforms
AN  - 2697711070
AB  - Virtually all major efforts to address global problems regarding land and resource use call for a multi-stakeholder process. At the same time, there is growing interest in, and commitment to, inclusion of previously marginalized groups – e.g., Indigenous Peoples and local communities (IPLCs), smallholders, and women in these groups – in decisions related to sustainable land and resource governance. Nevertheless, multi-stakeholder platforms and forums (MSFs) tend to be idealized as imagined spaces for collaboration among equals, despite ample prior research demonstrating that fostering equity in such "invited spaces" is no easy feat. This article draws on a comparative study of 11 subnational MSFs aimed at improving land and forest use practices in Brazil, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Peru. It analyzes data from interviews with more than 50 IPLC forum participants to understand their perspective on efforts to address equity in the MSFs in which they are participating, as well as their opinion of the potential of MSFs in comparison with other participants. The research sought to understand how MSFs can ensure voice and empowerment and address inequality, and thus be accountable to the needs and interests of IPLCs. The interviews show that IPLCs are overall optimistic, but the results also provide insights into accountability failures. The article argues that to bring about change – one that takes equality, empowerment and justice seriously – there needs to be greater strategic attention to how marginalized groups perceive their participation in multi-stakeholder processes. It builds on the lessons from the literature and the findings to propose specific ways that MSFs might foster the collective action or counter power that less powerful actors need to hold more powerful actors accountable.

T1  - ‘Plant, Sleep, Pick’: Ambivalent Smallholder Market Engagement and Inclusive Value Chains in Northwest Nepal
AN  - 2688008082
AB  - Inclusive value chain frameworks have been widely adopted by states and international development agencies as a strategy for addressing rural poverty. The approach aims to improve smallholder farmers’ linkages to agricultural markets and to increase the value of their products within these markets. Inclusive value chain initiatives targeting apple producers in northwestern Nepal are illustrative of this development approach. This article examines apple production in Jumla District, which has expanded rapidly over the last two decades, and shows how value chain development interventions have sought to accelerate a shift towards commercial agriculture by linking producers to agribusiness partners and upgrading production. A central assumption of these interventions is that farmers will aim to maximize profits through entrepreneurial strategies within targeted value chains. However, as this article demonstrates, a closer investigation of the political ecology of apple production in the region calls this assumption into question. The article argues that the popularity of apples in Jumla District must be situated within processes of agrarian change and livelihood diversification that have informed labour‐saving, risk‐averse approaches to apple market participation. The findings lend support to calls for strategies that prioritize autonomy and long‐term risk mitigation over competitive market integration.

T1  - Collectivization of smallholder farmers, strategic competition, and market performance: Experiences from two selected villages of West Bengal, India
AN  - 2685042518
AB  - Given the structure and functioning of agricultural markets and the policies and institutional space, smallholder farmers in India often face the risks of strategic failures, which force them to either opt for distress selling, operate as fringe retailers or participate in the existing supply or value chains on given conditions. In this perspective, this paper examines if smallholder farmers' collectives can potentially strengthen their market position vis‐à‐vis other individual players and enable them to explore strategic options in a greater way. On the basis of the structure–conduct–performance theory and field experiences from two selected villages of West Bengal (India), the paper finds that the collectivization of smallholder farmers helps in exploring a larger set of strategic options for better outcomes. Further, the choice of the strategy set varies across the collectives depending on their composition, functioning, and resource endowments. Nevertheless, there is a possibility of strategic failures because of intra‐ as well as intercollective conflicts and competition from other players. The success in this regard would, therefore, depend on how the collectives democratically resolve such conflicts and develop capacity and capabilities to enhance their competitiveness for greater strategic success. Besides, addressing market imperfections through policy and institutional interventions would also be crucial.

T1  - Preferences of Small-Scale Farmers for Innovative Farming Techniques in Volcanic Highlands in Rwanda
AN  - 2702534947
AB  - This paper attempted to identify the determinant factors of innovative technologies preferences by small-scale farmers in the Volcanic Highlands in Rwanda. Data used were collected from a random sample of 401 small-scale crop producers using a structured questionnaire in the study area. A logit regression model was specified, whereby a binary maximum likelihood estimation method was used to identify the factors affecting of the adoption of chemical fertilizers, the determinants of the combined use of chemical and organic fertilizers, the determinants of the adoption of improved seeds, as well as the determinant factors of appropriate use of pesticides. The results showed that farmer's education level, farming experience, membership to farm cooperative, the number of extension visits, and crop farming are the factors that affect positively the probability of adopting one or other of the four innovative farming techniques. From these results, we suggest the enhancement of extension services and other needed support to small-scale farmers (grants and subsidies, access to finance for example), the spread of professional trainings to farmers, and the increased farmers' access to high-yielding seed varieties if farming professionalization and innovative farming techniques are still among the development goals.

T1  - Dissenting Bodies, Disruptive Pandemic: Farmers' Protest and Women's Participation in Mass Mobilisation in India
AN  - 2685683298
AB  - While authoritarian states promoting neoliberal forms of governance have taken advantage of COVID-19 to weaken the foundations of civil society, there has also been a significant rise in contemporary struggles for a more democratic society during and around the pandemic. From December 2019 to November 2021, India has seen a significant number of protests. The timeline of collective resistance against the state and its divisive, violent and neoliberal agenda represents a critical juncture in Indian politics. This paper focuses on the farmers' protests that started from last November and recently ended in a stunning, hard-earned victory. In a sector that is overwhelmingly male-dominated and deeply patriarchal, women farmers have come out on the streets protesting the controversial Farm Laws hastily passed by the Indian government in September 2019 that threatened to corporatize farming and increase exploitation and marginalisation of small farmers. What is most interesting about the farmers' protests is large-scale participation of women across caste, class, occupational, and religious divide which has changed the composition and dynamics of collective resistance and demonstrate how organised and collective resistance can become symbols of solidarity and intersectional dissent. The paper will examine the role of gender and female agency in protests by female occupying bodies in physical spaces particularly when under the pretext of COVID -19 crisis management the state has severely pushed back against citizens right to dissent and fight for justice. The farmer's protest has brought to the fore women's role in mass mobilisations. Women's participation in the protest has tremendous significance for women's movement for justice, equality and rights and can pose a real challenge to the return of the 'Strong State'.

T1  - Impacts of cooperative membership on banana yield and risk exposure: Insights from China
AN  - 2674229265
AB  - The yield‐increasing effects of agricultural cooperative membership have been widely examined in the literature. However, so far, little is known about whether cooperative membership has the potential to reduce farmers’ exposure to production risk. We address this gap by estimating the impacts of cooperative membership on expected yield, yield variance (variability), and yield skewness (exposure to downside risk), using data collected from a survey of 626 banana farmers in China. We employ an endogenous switching regression model to address the selectivity bias issue. The empirical results show that cooperative membership increases banana yield by 3% and reduces the variance and downside risk exposure by 60% and 114%, respectively. The results are supported by robustness check estimates, using propensity score matching and inverse probability weighted regression adjustment models. Additional analysis reveals that the treatment effects of cooperative membership vary among members with different household and farm characteristics. Our findings suggest that agricultural cooperatives can be an effective institutional arrangement for reducing production risk and crop failure and point to the need for policies and programmes in developing cooperatives and increasing membership involvements of smallholder farmers.

T1  - Gendered differences in decision-making and participation in value chains: lessons from the highlands of Peru
AN  - 2670432064
AB  - Value chain development (VCD) has emerged as one pro-poor market-oriented strategy targeting smallholder farmers. Emphasis has been placed on women smallholders, but few studies examine intra-household dynamics related to VCD opportunities. Through a case study on native potato value chains in the central highlands of Peru, this study draws on semi-structured interviews to explore intra-household decisions to participate in VCD, how household agricultural labour is organised, and barriers to women’s involvement. Despite efforts encouraging women to participate, men dominated all aspects of the initiative. Thus, proactive efforts by development organisations need to address resource discrepancies and entrenched gender norms.

T1  - Impact of cooperative membership on production efficiency of smallholder goat farmers in Nepal: Annales de l'economie Collective
AN  - 2668580254
AB  - Goat is a source of cash income to smallholders in many developing countries. The productivity of goat farmers is poorly understood and assumed similar across all households. Cooperatives are hailed as an institution that can provide market power to smallholders in developing countries. We assess the impact of cooperatives on the technical efficiency of goat farmers in Nepal. Multistage sampling and in‐person interviews were used to collect information from 334 nonmember and 327 member cooperative farmers from two prominent goat production districts in Nepal. We use translog production function to calculate the technical efficiency. The endogeneity associated with cooperative membership is addressed through an instrumental variable approach. The one‐step analysis was used to avoid bias due to the one‐sided stochastic frontier analysis error. All conventional inputs have significant and positive impact on performance. Cooperative membership shows positive and significant impact on technical efficiency. The average technical efficiency score of cooperative members was 93.2%, while of nonmembers was 90.7%, and the difference was significant. Variables positively affecting technical efficiency include number of family members in agriculture, education, and training on goat production. Cooperative membership encourages farmers to embark on commercial production, fodder tree planting, farm byproducts utilization and kitchen waste utilization.

T1  - Disentangling the impact of a multiple-component project on SDG dimensions: The case of durum wheat value chain development in Oromia (Ethiopia)
AN  - 2696131651
AB  - The overall objective of this paper is to assess the impact of a value chain development project – the AVCPO in the Bale region (Oromia, Ethiopia) – on smallholder households focusing on the relationship between the food security goal (SDG2) and other SDG-related outcomes such as education (SDG4) and collective action and social capital (SDG16). Possible co-benefits and synergies among the SDGs are explored using a variety of approaches ranging from instrument variable techniques to evaluate the project overall impact on the various SDGs, multi-valued treatment effect analysis to assess which project component is more effective in achieving the expected impacts, and causal mediation modelling to evaluate to what extent collective action and social capital can play a role in achieving food security and education. Our study shows that the aggregate impact is positive and significant on most of the considered outcomes, namely food security (SDG2) except diet diversification, education (SDG4) of girls but not of boys, and collective action (SDG16), while social capital (SDG16) is significant only as far as horizontal relationships within the community are created. Disentangling the aggregate impact, we show that combined treatments (e.g. training plus storage facilities and marketing through cooperatives) generally return larger impacts than stand-alone treatments (e.g. training only). Finally, our study finds that collective action (SDG16) is an important channel that favors food security improvement (SDG2) but only to a lesser extent better education (SDG4).

T1  - Agricultural value chain development in Nepal: Understanding mechanisms for poverty reduction
AN  - 2664777731
AB  - This analysis investigates the potential mechanisms and the practical significance of agricultural value chain development in a geographically challenging rural area of a developing country. Using data from a carefully designed primary survey administered in a hill and mountainous region in Western Nepal, we show that linking small‐scale producers to regional and local traders can help increase income. Analysis of impact pathways shows that the positive impact on household income emerges through higher agricultural income, driven by higher sale volume at lower prices. Focusing on high value commodities in rural areas, where arable land is not always fully exploited or utilized, appears to lead to acreage expansion and some crop switching, contributing to higher supply albeit at lower prices. The positive impact on household income is practically significant; it helps improve household food security and asset accumulation. These findings are robust to alternative specifications. Targeted value chain interventions that strengthen and stabilize small‐scale producers’ access to markets can contribute to rural poverty reduction via increase in agricultural income.

T1  - Toward territorialised dairy inclusive businesses: insights from an Egyptian case study: making dairy businesses inclusive
AN  - 2662183651
AB  - Building inclusive businesses with small-scale producers in the agro-food sector presents challenges, most notably in terms of governance and sustainability. These issues were explored through a Danone Egypt Ecosystem Project that sought to promote a replicable business model of milk collection centers to secure a dairy plant’s sourcing while contributing to the socio-economic development of smallholders. Quality management was used to link a value chain approach and a localised agri-food system approach. The study showed that an inclusive business relying on non-inclusive coordination had limited efficiency. Decreasing power asymmetries and distances between partners seems central to ensuring sustainability.

T1  - Gendered repertoires of contention: women’s resistance, authoritarian state formation, and land grabbing in Cambodia
AN  - 2655363553
AB  - This article was named the winner of the 2020 Enloe Award. The committee commented:This article embodies the spirit of the Enloe Award in providing a feminist understanding of the everyday experiences and strategies of poor women’s social movements against the authoritarian regime in Cambodia. It traces the co-constitution of gendered formations of the state and women’s collective action through an account of four distinct types of “gendered repertoires of contention” used by the women to protest Cambodia’s land grab. The critical-reflexive understanding of social movements offered here illuminates strategies of feminist resistance to authoritarian state power in Cambodia and beyond. The article stood out for its clarity and evidence-based narrative, and we are delighted that it has won the award.ABSTRACTAs strongmen and autocrats become increasingly visible in global politics, what gendered resistances arise and how do these contend with repressive regimes? Since 2017, following a severe purge of his critics, Cambodia’s longstanding Prime Minister Hun Sen has put the country under a near total form of authoritarian rule. His regime has been bolstered by a distinct mode of accumulation involving large-scale land transfers to foreign and domestic allies, which have systematically evicted and dispossessed a large number of the country’s smallholder farmers and the urban poor of their homes and agricultural lands. Amid this surge of “land grabbing,” Cambodian women from across the country have led and sustained public protests to reclaim their lands. In this article, I study the routines and performances of poor women’s collective action against the state and outline four distinct types of “repertoires of contention” used by women in their protests: strategic positioning, anti-politics, self-sacrifice, and solidarity. I argue that these repertoires are embedded in and enact the authoritarian state that they contest and advance the notion of the “gendered authoritarian state” that is made visible in contentious interactions between the state and its dispossessed citizens.

T1  - Challenges of agri-food supply in city region food systems: an emerging economy perspective
AN  - 2640878577
AB  - Purpose>This paper explores the challenges of food security from source to consumption of agri-food value chain by considering urban–rural linkages in city region food systems (CRFSs) and proposes a strategic framework for CRFS identifying strategies to promote urban–rural linkages among multiple stakeholders.Design/methodology/approach>A qualitative case study approach to a fruit and vegetable value chain from rural source to consumption in the Colombo City region identifies the challenges of food security. A snowballing sampling method was used to gather information from retailers, wholesalers, commission agent, farmers and consumers. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews, observations and secondary data sources. The data were analysed using thematic analysis.Findings>Challenges in food security in the value chain related to five areas: input and production, infrastructure, public institutional support and policy, finance, and food market. Colombo city is heavily dependent on food sourced from other cities due to limited land and lack of locally situated commercially oriented farmers.Research limitations/implications>This research is limited to a selected number of fruits and vegetables in the Colombo city region and leaves out other food items.Originality/value>This study contributes to informing policy and decision-making processes to promote a more balanced rural to city food value chain in Colombo City that could benefit all stakeholders from rural small-scale producers to urban consumers.

T1  - The rise of supermarkets in Zimbabwe against a tide of macroeconomic uncertainty
AN  - 2637197741
AB  - Zimbabwe has experienced a rise in supermarkets despite its volatile macroeconomic environment. Using data elucidated from key informants in the supermarket retail sector, the study observes that Zimbabwe is still relatively attractive to foreign investors as its food retail sector is not yet saturated. Zimbabwe’s supermarket expansion is driven by the entry of global, regional, and home-grown chains, growing urbanisation and an upsurge in consumerism. Unlike other African countries, Zimbabwe supermarket sector is unique due to its historical footprint, macroeconomic and policy uncertainty. Supermarket development challenges include exclusion of small farmers, modernising procurement systems, difficult operating environment characterised by liquidity crisis, hyperinflation, energy shortages, and deficient infrastructure. Future supermarket growth could emerge from a more stable macroeconomic environment, improved backbone infrastructure, upgrading value chains and penetration of untapped markets in second tier cities and small rural towns.

T1  - Tobacco Farming and the Reconfiguration of Co-operatives in Tanzania
AN  - 2696367599
AB  - Tobacco has been grown in Tanzania since the 1950s and remains a designated strategic export crop cultivated under contract farming arrangements. This article examines the role of primary co-operative societies (PCSs) in co-ordinating the tobacco contract farming system. The article traces the transition from public marketing boards to private sector predominance and contributes to an understanding of the dynamics of contractual arrangements between private capital and smallholder tobacco farmers. It draws primarily on data collected through in-depth interviews with tobacco-processing companies and the leaders of PCSs in Urambo district, Tanzania. The analysis shows that the PCSs that are central to this sector need to ensure that their members farm in accordance with good agricultural practices and comply with reforestation and labour practice requirements as part of the industry’s focus on corporate social responsibility programmes and the promulgation of strategies addressing social and environmental concerns. Furthermore, the PCSs have become the gatekeepers for local development projects co-funded by the Tanzanian tobacco processing companies and global cigarette brand owners. The article argues that the PCSs’ ability to capture economic benefits for local development by tapping into the tobacco value chain depends not only on PCS leadership qualifications, capabilities and their capacity to ‘align’ farmers with the required cultivation practices, but also on the bargaining capacity of the PCSs in relation to the tobacco processing companies, which is influenced by whether the supply base is reliable in both quantity and quality. Recent developments in the contract farming arrangements provide new constellations of economic dynamics and opportunities for social and economic development activities at the PCS and village levels. The article ends with a discussion of rural development outcomes based on tobacco revenues, showing how contract farming integrates local communities into the dynamics of the global tobacco value chain while simultaneously reproducing local socio-economic differentiation.

T1  - Comparing Coal Mining Industries and Palm Oil Plantations Impacts on The Human Security of Local Communities
AN  - 2695091672
AB  - Coal mining and palm oil plantations are important sectors for supporting development in Indonesia. However, these sectors are criticized as the cause of horizontal conflicts, deforestation, and natural disasters that threaten the human security of local communities. Therefore, this research aims to compare the extent to which coal mining industries and palm oil plantations have impacted the human security of local communities by applying comparative process tracing as in the case of Kalimantan Timur and Kalimantan Tengah. This result showed that palm oil plantations have lower negative impacts on the human security of local communities than coal mining industries. Mining has co-opted the livelihood of local communities as those who initially worked as farmers lose job opportunities due to the transfer of agriculture to mining. In contrast, palm oil plantations cooperate with local laborers and farmers in the Nucleus Estate Smallholder scheme (NES), which prevents unemployment. Therefore, in the context of local communities' human security, government should develop palm oil plantations than coal mining.

T1  - FACTORS AFFECTING INCOME GENERATION AMONG SMALLHOLDER FARMERS WITH AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE MEMBERSHIP IN ZAMBIA
AN  - 2690251459
AB  - This study analysed the effects of cooperative member characteristics on income generation among smallholder farmers in Chibombo district of Central Zambia using logistic regression from a sample size of 398 co-operative members. The aim of the study was to analyze factors affecting income generation among small-holder famers with membership in agricultural cooperatives, and to identify factors that increase their income. Data were collected in May 2020 using a questionnaire. The empirical data indicated that income increased when there were increases in the cultivated area, primary education and cooperative membership period of 5–10 years but decreased with marriage, being widowed and a farming experience period of 5–10 years. The other factors had no significant effect. Thus, the study concludes that increasing cultivated area, duration of cooperative membership and attending at least primary education would better income generation among cooperative members.

T1  - Best management practices for sustainable oil palm production: the case of smallholder farmers’ adoption in Ghana
AN  - 2680072430
AB  - The economic potential of oil palm for Ghana and many other developing countries in the tropics is substantial but largely remain unharnessed. Employing both quantitative and qualitative methods including treatment effect models, this study examines the yield difference between adopters and non-adopters of oil palm Best Management Practices (BMPs) among a large number of smallholder farmers and how this may be shaped by factors mostly relating to sectoral innovation system challenges. We found fertiliser application to be the only BMP which independently had a statistically significant yield difference. However, we found further that the adoption of more than any five of the BMPs also had a significant yield difference even after one controls for the effect of fertiliser application. These results tend to vary by the size of the oil palm plots and also appear to be largely associated with differences in the commitment of the farmers to implementing the BMPs, their capacity to absorb the investment cost of adoption and their expected monetary returns on such investment, which are linked to challenges within the oil palm value chain and sectoral innovation system. Our quantitative results are stable under different estimation models and variations in control variables.

T1  - Insights into the Cocoa and Forests Initiative: Smallholder Engagement with Certification Programs and Agroforestry
AN  - 2663197308
AB  - The Cocoa and Forests Initiative (CFI) in Côte d’Ivoire aims to address forest loss associated with cocoa cultivation by reducing deforestation and encouraging agroforestry. This study explores the relationship between certification programs, which operate primarily through cooperatives, and agroforestry to better understand the environment in which smallholder cocoa farmers operate. This study employs qualitative interviews and quantitative survey data to investigate farmer perceptions of certification programs and agroforestry initiatives and the impact of certification on participation in such initiatives. Farmers widely practiced low levels of agroforestry, about which they held generally positive views, and while certified farmers did not have more agroforestry trees, they were more knowledgeable about the benefits to cocoa production than non-certified farmers. Furthermore, many certified farmers conflated certification with cooperative membership. Understanding the role of preexisting institutions like certification and cooperatives is essential for the successful implementation of the CFI in a smallholder context.

T1  - Weather Index Based Microinsurance for Agriculture Industry
AN  - 2662754445
AB  - Agriculture is particularly susceptible to weather fluctuations. Climate change and agriculture productivity are inextricably linked. Thus, agriculture insurance should be introduced in Malaysia to manage losses and help small farmers to be aid from financial risk that is linked to the impact of the weather conditions on the crop yield. This study presents an investigation on the implementation of weather index based crop insurance contract for the states with the high correlation between the crop production and weather indices. The main aim of the study is to identify the appropriateness of the index insurance to selected crops in different regions in Malaysia. The Rainfall Anamoly Index and Standardized Precipitation Index are chosen in this study. Crop data is detrended to remove presence of time trend before determining the correlation between weather indices. The study continued with the computation of the trigger and exit thresholds for weather indices that corresponds to the crop loss using model-based clustering which will be used to calculate the expected annual loss and pure premium for each crop in different locations. The results showed that only several crops in certain locations are affected by weather. This research also includes farmers’ affordability to pay for premium.

T1  - Demystifying agritourism development in Fiji: Inclusive growth for smallholders
AN  - 2647617972
AB  - Agritourism has gained traction with a variety of stakeholders within the Pacific to supplement farm revenue, create linkages to tourism and ultimately contribute to sustainable economic development. This paper, with a focus on smallholders, examines the key constraints of agriculture, current agritourism products, policy development initiatives, and proposes an open framework for agritourism in Fiji. Among the key considerations are a careful examination of tourist preferences, the promotion of agritourism on working farms without displacing the key activity of food production, and redefining agritourism as a value for money experience rather than a niche market in the Pacific region.

T1  - Prices, specialty varieties, and postharvest practices: Insights from cacao value chains in Ecuador
AN  - 2646154046
AB  - Efforts to improve cacao value chains often assume that production of fine and flavor varieties will raise smallholder incomes. Undertaking postharvest practices of fermentation and drying is another exercise assumed to increase value‐added capture by smallholder producers. This study employs household data from 340 cacao farms in 15 villages in coastal Ecuador during 2018 to empirically assess these assumptions. Contrary to the common belief of the international development community, we find that the production of fine and flavor cacao varieties has no association with the price received by small‐scale producers. This is mainly due to (i) low productivity and (ii) nonexistent price premiums. Findings also suggest that the use of postharvest practices of fermentation and drying may lead to substantial price responses irrespective of the type of variety grown. The results presented here have implications for program interventions aimed at increasing farmer revenue. Programs promoting the use of fine and flavor varieties alone might be misguided and can be improved by training in modern processing techniques, regardless of the variety produced. [EconLit Citations: O12, Q01, Q12, Q13].

T1  - Soybean production in Paraguay: Agribusiness, economic change and agrarian transformations
AN  - 2642227627
AB  - Contemporary corporate‐led agricultural commodity production has seen profound transformations in rural spaces. This article focuses on soybean production in Paraguay, analysing corporate activity in the productive, commercial and economic dynamics of the soybean market and identifies the impacts of this monoculture on small farmers. Drawing on mixed methods, the research points to high levels of concentration of this market in the hands of a few transnational companies, which control the value chain via contractual relations with farmers. Through a complex set of relations, soybean production has seen smallholder farmers fall into debt and become unable to maintain their activity and migrate to new regions, leasing their land and, in the worst cases, lose both their land and status as farmers.

T1  - Technical Efficiency of Teff Production Among Smallholder Farmers: Beta Regression Approach
AN  - 2638858165
AB  - In Ethiopia, the traditional production system is not sufficient to feed the population growing at an alarming rate. Thus, targeting the efficiency of smallholder farmers have a substantial contribution to attain the maximum possible output with the existing inputs. Accordingly, this study analyzed the technical efficiency of teff production among smallholder farmers' using the stochastic frontier model. For this purpose, a total of 384 smallholder farmers were selected using a multistage sampling technique. Face-to-face interviews, focus group discussion and key informant interviews were used to collect quantitative and qualitative data. The result shows that the number of oxen, land size allocated to teff, amount of Diammonium Phosphate (DAP), urea, and seed significantly explain teff production function. About 25.8% of smallholder teff producer farmers operate below the maximum capacity given the level of technology. Moreover, age of the household head, livestock ownership, and market distance affect smallholder farmers to produce below the maximum capacity; whereas, credit service users and large land size owners were less inefficient than their counterparts. Therefore, special priority should be given to land productivity, urea, DAP, improved seed and oxen days to improve smallholder farmers’ technical efficiency in teff production. Additionally, policymakers should design and implement policies targeting smallholder farmers' sources of technical inefficiency in teff production. Moreover, the option for enhancing production and productivity through technical efficiency improvement technologies should be targeted to minimize sources of inefficiency in teff production.

T1  - Additionality and Implementation Gaps in Voluntary Sustainability Standards
AN  - 2631378280
AB  - Voluntary Sustainability Standards have become a popular private governance framework for more sustainable agri-food value chains. However, recent mainstreaming efforts have increased competition between standards and driven down price premiums. This study employs a dataset of 659 Honduran coffee producers to examine whether the most widely used standards in the coffee sector (4C, Fairtrade, Fairtrade/organic, UTZ Certified and Rainforest Alliance) represent effective solutions for improving the social, environmental and economic sustainability practices of smallholder farmers under such conditions. It presents 54 farm-level indicators, compared across five standard systems, and links field results to a discussion of the strategies and governance prospects of voluntary standards. We find that no scheme has managed to grow substantially while maintaining strong additionality: commercially successful standards show little impact, while stricter schemes create high entry barriers and unresolved opportunity costs. Successful mainstreaming would require better cost coverage of sustainability improvements by value chain actors .

T1  - EFFECT OF NIGER STATE RICE INVESTMENT CONSORTIUM PROJECT ON COMMERCIALIZATION LEVELS OF SMALLHOLDER FARMERS IN NIGER STATE, NIGERIA
AN  - 2647398321
AB  - The study assessed the effects of Niger State Rice Investment Consortium (NSRIC) project on commercialization levels of smallholder rice farmers in Niger State, Nigeria. A total sample size of 234;made up of 117 participants and 117 non-participants drawn from 12 localities in three (3) Local Government Areas (LGAs) were selected through multi-stage sampling technique. Data were collected from primary source using well-structured questionnaire administered by the researcher and with the assistance of well-trained enumerators from the Niger State Bureau of Statistics (NSBS). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, household commercialization index (HCI), Tobit regression model and Henry Garrett technique. The result of HCI revealed the mean household commercialization indices of 67.25%, 31.57% and 49.41% for participant, non-participant and pooled sample, respectively. The Tobic regression analysis disclosed that the coefficients of household size and extension contact were negative but however, significantly influenced smallholder level of rice commercialization. The coefficient of gender, farm size, quantity of rice produced, NSRIC project participant, access to market information, unit price of product, irrigation, access to Factorization and training were positive and significantly influenced smallholder rice commercialization. The costs and returns analysis revealed that the farmers earned N123,684.08 and N46,872.14 for participants and non-participants, respectively. It was recommended that governments at all levels should develop appropriate policies and strategies to promote the commercialization of smallholder Agriculture in the State and farmers themselves should form and maintain effective farmer groups to take advantage of better market prices for their products through their collective bargaining power.

T1  - When Agronomy Flirts with Markets, Gender, and Nutrition: A Political Ecology of the New Green Revolution for Africa and Women’s Food Security in Burkina Faso
AN  - 2652490602
AB  - Advocates of the Green Revolution for Africa (GR4A) argue that the best way to address malnutrition is to incorporate smallholders into the global food economy via value chains involving the use of improved inputs, production technologies, and access to markets. Moseley and Ouedraogo critically assess these tactics using a feminist political ecology lens to analyze GR4A efforts in southwestern Burkina Faso which target female rice farmers. They examine the nature of the GR4A rice value chain, the degree to which a GR4A project is impacting the nutrition of participating women, and the influence of gender roles on GR4A rice project outcomes.

T1  - Can improving animal health and biosecurity knowledge of para‐veterinarians in Cambodia assist in addressing challenges in smallholder livestock farming?
AN  - 2644398368
AB  - Para‐veterinarians are crucial in providing front‐line veterinary care and advice to smallholder farmers in countries with under‐resourced national veterinary services. Many of these individuals undergo basic training with minimal monitoring and evaluation of performance and knowledge levels. To identify the knowledge, attitudes and practices of Cambodian para‐veterinarians a cross‐sectional survey (n = 80) of Village Animal Health Workers (VAHWs) was conducted during August 2018 in the provinces of Tbong Khmum and Takeo in southern Cambodia. Descriptive statistics indicated that VAHWs had a high level (mean score 86%) of animal health and biosecurity knowledge. As the Royal Government of Cambodia continues to move towards commercial agricultural value chains, VAHWs are crucial to ensuring the safety and sustainability of these systems. Binomial logistic regression modelling found the length of employment (p = .003), reporting of pig diseases (p = .007), recommending the quarantine of newly purchased animals (p = .008), treatment of cases of haemorrhagic septicaemia with antibiotics (p = .032) and washing footwear with water when entering or leaving a farm (p = .008) were all positively associated with a higher (≥92%) animal health and biosecurity knowledge score. These results demonstrate the correlation of positive biosecurity and disease reporting behaviours with high levels of knowledge, providing evidence that improved training of VAHWs can ensure they remain important in supporting the under‐resourced national veterinary services. Regular monitoring and evaluation of training programmes for VAHWs will likely further strengthen the livestock sector in Cambodia.

T1  - Empowering women farmers through collective action: a case study of Khanizpur Hamlet, Odisha
AN  - 2640197493
AB  - Vulnerable landless women farmers face the dual challenge of small farm size and illegality of land tenancy. These smallholders face a lack of bargaining power in input and output markets and economic non-viability of technology adoption. We piloted a collective action model of organizing agriculture production work called “Small Farmers Large Field” with 35 landless tenant women farmers in Khanizpur village, Odisha. Within an embedded mixed method design, the study included the collection of both qualitative and quantitative data. In this QUAL + quan design, the qualitative dataset assumes the primary role. The results indicate that the per acre net income that represented a loss of INR 2,831 in the previous wet season changed to a positive profit of INR 15,065. Much of the increase in net income was due to the 60% increase in yield. Several factors including the use of good-quality seeds and adoption of improved practices contributed to such yield improvement. Apart from the monetary benefits, the collective action among farmers resulted in many non-monetary benefits such as improved knowledge on technology and production practices, stronger social network and civic engagement, and efficient use of water. In addition, farmers had a significant amount of time saving in different field operations.

T1  - Integrative and Exclusionary Roles of Trust in Timber Value Chain in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania
AN  - 2638554526
AB  - Contract and trust are the two main governance mechanisms that influence actors’ integration into value chains. Nevertheless, most studies treat trust as a complement to formal contract, paying less attention on the circumstances in which trust becomes a sole mechanism of governance. The aim of this article is to examine how trust shapes integration in the non-industrial timber value chain in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. Timber, which is the pillar of the districts’ revenue in the area, contributes significantly to the income of smallholder households. The study adopted an exploratory cross-sectional study design whereby data were collected mainly through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with actors of the timber value chain. The findings showed that spot market and relational governance were the two main linkages in the timber value chain. Spot market linkage is characterized by absence or little trust, while some trust is present in relational linkage. In relational linkage, trust helps integration of actors in the value chain through enabling them access market information, capital in the form of credit, technology for processing timber, and coordination and collaboration among the actors. However, trust is associated with some challenges and to some actors, it plays an exclusionary role. The study recommends for the promotion of trust along with other social control mechanisms such as social knowledge in order to address these challenges.

T1  - Effects of cooperative membership on financial performance of banana farmers in China: A heterogeneous analysis: Annales de l'economie Collective
AN  - 2628273372
AB  - This paper estimates the heterogeneous effects of cooperative membership on smallholder farmers’ financial performance, measured by net returns, return on investment (ROI), and profit margin. We employ an innovative two‐stage predictor substitution model combined with an unconditional quantile regression model to address the endogeneity of the cooperative membership variable and analyze data collected from 626 banana farmers in China. Results, in general, show that cooperative membership improves banana farm financial performance. Particularly, we show that cooperative membership affects net returns and ROI positively and significantly across the selected unconditional quantiles, with the highest impact occurring at the highest 80th quantile. Cooperative membership also has a positive and significant impact on the profit margin for all quantiles (except for the 20th quantile), but the larger impacts occurring at the lower quantiles.

T1  - The potential of land shareholding cooperatives for inclusive agribusiness development in Africa: Annales de l'economie Collective
AN  - 2628273102
AB  - Land Shareholding Cooperatives (LSCs) centralize management over fragmented farmland by converting farmers' plots into shares. While these cooperatives have been widely successful in boosting agricultural commercialization among rural smallholders in China, their potential has not yet been recognized in the African context. To fill this gap, we present and discuss a theoretical framework based on recent literature, an in‐depth case study from Uganda and quantitative analyses of data on horticultural cooperatives from Senegal and agricultural and livestock cooperatives from Uganda, Malawi, Madagascar, Rwanda and Kenya. We uncover the existence of cooperatives built on land sharing schemes in different parts of Africa and especially in Rwanda. We find that these LSCs are more likely to mobilize collective marketing and have a higher business‐membership ratio than traditional cooperatives, and we derive a few implications for policymaking.

T1  - What is the contribution of forest-related income to rural livelihood strategies in the Philippines' remaining forested landscapes?
AN  - 2638079927
AB  - Forest products have become scarce for local communities in the Philippines. After decades of severe deforestation, a net gain in forest area has only been observed in recent years for the first time. This paper seeks to broaden the understanding of forest livelihood relationships at the turning point of a forest transition trajectory. Based on 993 household surveys from 10 distinct research sites, we use Hierarchical Cluster Analysis to identify six distinct livelihood strategies (LS): remittances-based, livestock-based, crop farming-based, business-oriented, natural resource-based, and wage-based strategies. The highest number of households belongs to the wage-based cluster, which also shows the highest total income. Forest-related incomes only account for small shares of total income for the vast majority of households, although most households collect limited quantities of forest products for domestic use. Nevertheless, one cluster, which includes 12.4% of the sample, generates the largest shares of their income from extractive activities like harvesting forest products and fishing. The households relying most strongly on natural resources in our study sites are also the ones with the lowest total income. Our finding implies that future reforestation policies have to put a special focus on incorporating livelihood benefits for local communities. This should go beyond short-term payments for activities such as tree planting and enable the rural households to derive long-term impacts for human well-being and poverty alleviation. Because most of the forest products reported by our surveyed households were collected for domestic use, they did not contribute much to total household income. This indicates a potential for improving rural income, if forest-product value chains at the smallholder level are improved by future policy interventions.

T1  - Perceived Risk and Willingness to Provide Loan to Smallholder Farmers in Ghana
AN  - 2628899048
AB  - In this article, we investigate whether lending institutions perceive smallholder (individual) farmers as riskier borrowers than farm cooperatives. Our research results show that individual farmers in Ghana are less likely to be successful in obtaining credit than cooperative farmers, because they are perceived to be riskier borrowers. In addition, results show that the willingness of lending institutions to provide loans is higher for those farmers who are associated with cooperative societies. This suggests that individual farmers can increase their odds of securing loans by joining a cooperative society. Empirical results also support the hypothesis that the interest rate is a significant predictor of the willingness to loan bias among lending institutions. In addition, our results indicate that higher interest rates are associated with increased loan risk. However, when interest rate is higher, longer loan maturity can dampen the effect of interest rate. In other words, an increase in loan maturity length reduces the effect of interest rate on the loan risk. These research results have important policy implications for the welfare of smallholder farmers in developing economies as lack of financing has a significant impact on smallholder farmer productivity.

T1  - Magnitude of investment and global value chain: a case study of textile and clothing industry of Pakistan
AN  - 2622092261
AB  - The objective of this study is to assess the impact of value addition chain and investment size on the sales revenue of export-oriented firms in Pakistan. Pakistan is severely facing the economic crisis because of its declining exports and growing external debt. The manufacturing of the intermediate products – yarn and fabric – belong to the capital-intensive industries. The large part of these products is exported to USA, China, European Union and Bangladesh. The importing partners convert these intermediate products into finished goods (garments, home textile, towel, etc.). Similarly, the finished goods which are produced by Pakistani companies and exported directly by the producers or small-scale brokerage houses do not have Pakistani brand names. The clothing sector companies in European Union and USA sale these products in super stores and retail shops under their brand names. This mechanism explains the distribution of benefits through the global value addition chain in textile and clothing industry. It is hypothesized in this study that sale revenues of textile manufacturing companies ares determined by the size of investment, type of products (stage of the integration), average lending rates, exchange rate in term of rupees per US dollar and the market access. Data for this analysis was extracted from the Annual Reports of the companies listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange. The data consists of 248 companies and 14 years (from 2003 to 2016). Through this panel data we quantified the impacts of the size of investment and the stage of value addition in textile chain on sales revenue. It is concluded that size of a company is a serious matter, while the total assets lead further increase in the sales revenue, however the negative sign with significant and robust parameters attached with the composite variable of the large companies’ category and value of its total assets reflects the decreasing rate of return on additional investment in large-scale companies. The devaluation of Pakistani currency has been positively affecting the sales of exporting sector companies. However, the lending rate of interest has not shown a significant impact.

T1  - Evaluating the commercialization of smallholder malt barley farmers via vertical coordination in Arsi highlands, Oromia region, Ethiopia
AN  - 2770810571
AB  - Smallholder farmers search for their product buyers in local spot market transactions. In spot market transactions, farmers will not be assured of ready markets for their production, or face volatile market prices. Similarly malt barley farmers used to face challenges of accessing input, farm technology, credit, and information that undermine their livelihoods. Vertically coordinated malt barley supply chain is evolving fast in Ethiopia. The purpose of this study was to analyze nexus between vertical coordination and level of malt barley commercialization in the study area. This study has been conducted in four districts of Arsi highlands known for their malt barley production potentials and presence of active supply chain coordination. A three-stage sampling procedure was employed to collect data using interview schedule from 384 (190 contract and 194 non-contract) randomly selected malt barley farmers. Descriptive statistics and Tobit regression model used to analyze farmer and farm-related factors vis-à-vis vertical coordination and level and determinants of commercialization farm households. Accordingly, the study identified that 11.05% of the respondents had <30% level of commercialization, when 55% were in between 30% and 65% and the rest, 34.21% of sampled malt barley farm households had more than 65% level of malt barley commercialization. Tobit regression revealed that farm size, yield, price, quantity of fertilizer applied, contract agreements, mobile phone ownership and access to credit were determinants of level of malt barley commercialization. Thus, endeavors of malt barley commercialization have to focus on improving access to technology, credit, extension, and organizing farmers in contract farming among others.

T1  - Determinants of wheat value chain in case of North Shewa Zone of Amhara region, Ethiopia
AN  - 2770809574
AB  - The main objective of the study is to identify the determinants of wheat value chain in case of North Shewa Zone of Amhara region, Ethiopia. The researchers used multistage purposive random sampling technique to select representative households in the study area. The ordinary least square output revealed that production of wheat, price of wheat and secondary and tertiary education of the household positively and significantly affect supply of wheat to the market. On the other hand, distance from the market and distance from the main road have negative and significant effect on supply of wheat. Moreover, the multinomial logit regression result showed that household family size and market information have positive and significant effect while distance from the market and ownership of livestock have negative and significant effect on smallholder farmers’ market participation. The binary logit model also indicates that land holding, access to market information, total livestock and primary education affected positively and significantly. Therefore, policies aiming at increasing farmer’s awareness of producing value added wheat produce to enhance value creations are recommended to strengthen chain development.

T1  - Local Engagement in the Agricultural Cooperatives (ACs) Operation in Cambodia
AN  - 2756818118
AB  - Agricultural Cooperatives (ACs) have empowered farmers to develop resources sustainably. They transfer traditional subsistence agriculture to diversify crops and develop a value chain. This paper aims to analyze local engagement by focusing on the degree of participation, factors influencing local engagement in ACs operations and the constraints of ACs operations to support communities. With a cohort of 421 farmer members in the Kampong Speu and Pursat provinces of Cambodia, household surveys were designed to consider how factors influence local engagement. It was discovered that: (i) local engagement in ACs operations is limited, and management of boards of directors is a critical constraint to motivating local involvement; (ii) local engagement in ACs operations is associated with access to water, benefits from ACs, participation in ACs activities, risk control and ACs management, and ACs operations do not promote access to agricultural inputs; and (iii) ACs operations have faced several constraints, including poor management, inadequate capital accumulation, unavailable loans, loan mismanagement, a lack of skills, high illiteracy levels, small share values, a lack of access to credit facilities, access to the competitive market and a lack of support from extension services. This empirical study, with implications from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), addresses a gap in the literature by exploring engagement in ACs operations.

T1  - Opportunities and Challenges of Indigenous Food Plant Farmers in Integrating into Agri-Food Value Chains in Cape Town
AN  - 2756734403
AB  - In many regions of the Global South, introduced crops have led to a loss of biodiversity and left the food system vulnerable to climate change. As a result, the (re-)introduction of indigenous food plants (IFPs) into agriculture is discussed as a way to a more sustainable and resilient food production, which might also be feasible for Southern small-scale garden farmers. In Cape Town (South Africa), the first attempts to commercialize IFPs of the Cape Floristic Region are currently being made. By using a value chain perspective, this study analyzes the opportunities and challenges for farmers to integrate IFPs into regional commercial agri-food chains. Based on qualitative interviews and ethnographic participant observation, we identify and explain different challenges and potentials: Challenges include the complex harvest licensing procedure and limited seed/cutting access for growers, limited capabilities and capacity of growers, the competition with subsidized conventional production and limited distribution options, as well as a negative cultural perception of IFPs and a lack of preparation knowledge at the consumption level. Further, we identified opportunities for environmental adaptation and income generation. Remarkably, our results indicated a, so far, barely discussed geographical component in the success of indigenous crops. The findings are useful for guiding relevant market development interventions and raising awareness of IFPs in Cape Town and beyond.

T1  - Market Outlet Choice and Its Effects on the Welfare of Smallholder Vegetable and Fruit Producers in Ethiopia
AN  - 2756706838
AB  - The decision to choose an appropriate market outlet may involve a self-selection problem. This suggests that unobservable characteristics play an important role, and the examination of the impact of market outlet choice on smallholder household welfare needs to correct this selection bias. Consequently, this study, by using a multinomial endogenous treatment model, examined the determinants of market outlet choices and their subsequent effects on the welfare of smallholder vegetable and fruit producers in Ethiopia. The results on the determinants of market outlet choices obtained using this model indicated that distance to main roads, livestock ownership, access to extension, and cooperative membership influenced the decisions of smallholder farmers in one way or another. Furthermore, the model results obtained by correcting the selectivity indicated that, relative to formal markets, informal markets have a low impact on the welfare of smallholder farmers. Thus, alternative policy measurements aimed at improving the food security and welfare of smallholder farmers should be accompanied by improving their access to formal markets.

T1  - Vegetable market supply by small holder farmers in Ethiopia
AN  - 2755671589
AB  - The paper analyzes the determinants of vegetable market participation in Ethiopia. The study procures data from primary and secondary databases. The primary data for this study are collected from vegetable producers through appropriate statistical procedures. Heckman two stages Econometrics model was applied to analyze the collected data. Among factors affecting farmers market participation decision, the first stage Heackman results disclose that district, family size, irrigation access, credit use, extension contact and lagged price are major factors that determine market participation decision of farmers. The second stage Heackman results indicates that sex, family size, irrigation access, land, credit use, extension service and inverse mill’s ratio were the key factors significantly determining how much would be sold into the market. Therefore, policy aiming at increasing farmers’ access to modern irrigation, gender consideration, credit access and improving extension service are recommended to accelerate the vegetable sector development.

T1  - Agricultural trade credit: Evidence from smallholder primary producers in Ghana
AN  - 2754500870
AB  - Orientation: Players in the agricultural value chain such as input suppliers, farmers (producers), traders (middlemen), processors or manufacturers and exporters do receive credit and extend credit, in the form of trade credit, as part of their transactions.
Research purpose: The purpose of the study is to examine agricultural trade credit, particularly the factors that influence the receipt and extension of agricultural trade credit in smallholder farmer settings.
Motivation for the study: The study is motivated by the limited understanding of trade credit activity in smallholder farmer settings in developing countries.
Research approach/design and method: It is a cross-sectional quantitative study. It utilised the Ghana Living Standards Survey Round 7 dataset (GLSS 7). The data contains 18 653 observations, and a multinomial logit model (MNL) was employed in the data analysis.
Main findings: The results show that trade credit receivable (where farmers extend credit to buyers) is more important relative to advance payment (where farmers receive credit from buyers). The receipt of advance payment is influenced by a farmer holding a preharvest contract, practising monocropping and coming from a smaller household. Age, marital status, literacy, crops sales value, national origin, marketing channels, type of crops and urban location are found to be significant explanatory factors of trade credit supply.
Practical/managerial implications: Trade credit, particularly input credit and advance payment, can help primary agricultural producers to mitigate their production credit constraints. However, a well-functioning agribusiness environment that will lower the risks associated with trade credit activity is very crucial.
Contribution/value-add: The study extends the frontiers of knowledge in agricultural financing by generating empirical evidence on trade credit activity in smallholder farmer settings in a developing country context.

T1  - Supply Chain Scheduling Optimization in an Agricultural Socialized Service Platform Based on the Coordination Degree
AN  - 2748564320
AB  - In order to create a sustainable agricultural production system and meet the multi-stage and differentiated production needs of farmers, this study proposes to build an agricultural service platform to dispatch agricultural service providers. Reasonably handling the collaborative relationship between farmers and service providers is a key issue in platform scheduling. Based on the analysis of the operation characteristics of the agricultural service platform, this study redefines the core issue of handling the collaborative relationship—the coordination degree—from the special characteristics of agricultural services, then analyzes it in depth and proposes a portrayal method. On this basis, a multi-stage and multi-objective scheduling optimization model, which integrally reflects the service utility and service combination operation efficiency, is constructed, and an improved genetic algorithm is proposed for solving it. Then, this study designs a numerical experiment which describes the multi-stage decision making of farmers, and the simulation results show that the optimization model can provide a balanced multi-objective supplier scheduling solution for them. Further, the validity and feasibility of the model and algorithm are verified through comparative tests of optimization effects and sensitive analysis. This study contributes to research on sustainable agriculture by modeling collaboration between smallholder farmers and agricultural service providers, and provides an effective decision-making tool for agricultural service platforms.

T1  - Smallholders’ Water Management Decisions in the Face of Water Scarcity from a Socio-Cognitive Perspective, Case Study of Viticulture in Mendoza
AN  - 2748215697
AB  - Grape producers in the Province of Mendoza (Argentina) are extremely vulnerable to the current water crisis, especially smallholders who have very limited resources to adapt. The discourse on adaptation options is mainly technocratic with a focus on modern irrigation systems not accessible to the majority of grape producers. Thus, this research aims at shedding light and providing information for the design of inclusive adaptation strategies by identifying, with a socio-cognitive model, feasible adaptation options according to grape producers’ perceptions and the related implementation barriers. Grape producers’ water scarcity and adaptation appraisal were explored through qualitative interviews in the Northern Oasis (Mendoza) to better understand how producers’ intentions are shaped through perceptual and socio-cognitive processes. To do so, a socio-cognitive model on grape producers’ adaptation to water scarcity (GPAWS) was developed based on two similar models. The analysis reveals that, as overall grape producers share a similar concern with the risk of water scarcity, their different adaptive behaviours tend to be mostly derived from their differences in adaptation appraisal. Moreover, producers’ adaptation intentions are mainly reactive and limited to answer short term, immediate risks. Most of the grape producers perceive feasibility and plan the implementation of reasonable efficiency measures. However, multiple barriers consequently limit the implementation of such adaptation options perceived as feasible by the producers. The results of this research can support government actors, agriculture research institutes, but also the cooperatives of producers seeking to encourage farmers’ adaptation, by identifying which adaptation options could be implemented according to the type of producers and their adaptation appraisal, but also why certain feasible measures are not being implemented.

AB  - The southwestern part of Nigeria, particularly Ogun State, is more vulnerable to the vagaries of climate change due to the high dependence on rain-fed agriculture and limited capacities to respond to climate change. In this study, factors influencing climate change adaptation strategies and its impacts on household food security of smallholder rice farmers in Ogun State were estimated. A multistage sampling technique was employed to select 120 smallholder rice farmers in the study area. The factors influencing the adoption of climate change adaptation practices and their impacts on household food security among smallholder rice farmers in Ogun State were examined using a probit model and an endogenous switching probit model (ESPM). According to the results of household dietary diversity score (HDDS), adopters of climate change adaptation techniques have higher levels of food security than non-adopters. The outcome of the ESPM shows that access to market information, access to extension agents, gender, off-farm income, and membership in cooperatives all contribute to the variations in food security experienced by both adopters and non-adopters of climate change adaptation strategies. A unit increase in adoption of climate change adaptation measures will increase household food security by about 3 units while decreasing severity in food insecurity by about 3.2 units. Therefore, it is recommended that policies that would support smallholder farmers’ decisions to embrace measures for coping with climate change should be encouraged in order to stimulate their adaptive capacity. Additionally, in order to secure the inclusive sustainability of the agricultural sector, stakeholders and NGOs must collaborate with each other to enhance the circumstances under which farmers may receive climate change information, timely agricultural loans, and policy incentives.

T1  - Safety and Quality of Milk and Milk Products in Senegal—A Review
AN  - 2734625338
AB  - Historically, local milk production in Senegal has struggled to keep up with the demands of consumers, so there has been a heavy reliance on imported milk and milk products. More recently, efforts have been made to improve local dairy production by establishing large, organized dairies that collect milk from rural production areas and developing small-scale processing units, such as mini dairies. The local dairy value chain in Senegal consists of (1) informal collection systems where farmers commonly deliver milk directly to dairies; (2) traditional and artisanal processing using simple equipment and techniques; and (3) short local marketing and sale circuits. Most West African dairy sectors are dominated by raw, unpasteurized milk or traditional, spontaneously fermented milk products, such as lait caillé in Senegal, sold through small-scale channels without a cold chain, so the risk of food safety hazards may be increased. Microbiological, chemical, and physical hazards have been found in milk and milk products across West Africa. There is a need to educate milk producers, small-scale processors, and vendors on the importance of refrigerating milk immediately after milking as well as maintaining the cold chain until the milk is heat treated and, subsequently, until the milk is marketed to the consumer. However, without assistance, obtaining the equipment necessary for cold storage and processing of milk can be challenging.

T1  - Farmers’ Participation in Modern Supply Chains: The Case of Mandarin Profitability in Punjab-Pakistan
AN  - 2734622486
AB  - In developing countries, supply chains are rapidly transforming. However, smallholder farmers, in particular, have experienced mixed impacts in inclusion and exclusion from modern supply chains (MSC). Therefore, by taking Pakistan’s mandarin industry as a case, this study aims to analyze the farmers’ efficiency and inclusiveness in modern supply chains and compare them across the farm size categories, i.e., small, medium, and large. For that purpose, cross-sectional data from 300 farmers were collected to test the posit objectives. The empirical investigation was made using the endogenous treatment effect model and the propensity score matching approach. Findings show that large farmers prefer to participate in MSC, driven by contractors, processors or exporters. Conversely, the smallholders are more inclined to participate in the traditional supply chains (TSCs), driven by village vendors, local retailers/consumers, middlemen, and traditional fruit and vegetable markets. The results also revealed a positive connection between efficiency and farmers’ inclusion in the MSC. Orchard size, education, off-farm income, and extension services positively impact profitability. In terms of an increase in farmers’ profitability, the efficiency improvement can benefit the resource-poor smallholders who make up 74% of the total farmers in the sample. Therefore, these results are noteworthy for devising policy actions to facilitate smallholder inclusion in the modern agri-food supply chains to alleviate rural poverty and ensure farmers’ wellbeing.

T1  - Farmers’ Preferred Genotype Traits and Socio-Economic Factors Influencing the Adoption of Improved Cowpea Varieties in South-Central Niger
AN  - 2734594795
AB  - Cowpea, Vigna unguiculata (L.) (Walpers, 1842), is an important legume for food and nutrition security, and income generation. Despite decade-long efforts to disseminate improved varieties, cowpea productivity remains low in Niger. This is due, in part, to the limited adoption of improved cowpea varieties among farmers. Increasing the adoption of improved cowpea varieties requires a better understanding of farmers’ preferred genotype traits and socio-economic factors that influence their decision. We interviewed 634 farmers from the south-central regions (Maradi and Zinder) of Niger to assess factors that influence their decision to adopt improved cowpea varieties. The average age of the respondent was 41 years with 29 years of farming experience. Eight improved cowpea varieties were grown by these farmers with average adoption rates ranging from 3.3 to 38.0%. Genotype traits that influenced farmers’ decision to adopt improved cowpea varieties included early maturing (86.9%), high yielding (73.9%), and high market value (50.5%). Socio-economic factors that significantly influenced adoption were age, gender, membership in a farmers’ organization, and contact with the extension services. Adoption is constrained by the limited availability of cowpea varieties with farmers’ preferred genotypes traits. Farmers’ preferences for genotype traits must be considered in the early stages of breeding programs and the release of new varieties to increase adoption. Stakeholders involved in the cowpea value chain can use this information to improve cowpea adoption and productivity.

T1  - How Do Cooperatives Alleviate Poverty of Farmers? Evidence from Rural China
AN  - 2728499807
AB  - Farmers’ cooperatives play an important role in enabling small farmers to integrate into modern agriculture. Based on the survey data of 7200 farmers in four provinces of China, this paper uses the multi-dimensional poverty measurement method and the instrumental variable method to reveal the transmission mechanism and multi-dimensional poverty reduction effect of farmers’ cooperatives in deep poverty-stricken areas in China to realize joint agricultural empowerment through the supply chain. The results show that farmers’ cooperatives play an important role in enhancing small farmers’ financing, technology application, market sales, and rights decision-making. Every increase in the degree of interest connection between the two will help farmers reduce the multi-dimensional poverty level by 12.3%, and the mitigation effects on material poverty, ability poverty, and rights poverty are between 10% and 13%. Compared with agricultural cooperatives with weak organizational service capacity, cooperatives with high organizational service capacity have a more significant multi-dimensional poverty reduction effect on farmers, which leads to farmers obtaining financing and improving their ability and income. In addition, the difference in benefit coupling between agricultural cooperatives and farmers of different leading bodies also results in the heterogeneity of multi-dimensional poverty alleviation effects of farmers. To a certain extent, the supply chain is affected by the risk endowment of members, the supply chain’s poverty alleviation performance is affected by members’ supply chain’s poverty alleviation performance, and there is a certain risk transfer and “distribution failure”. Therefore, optimizing the benefit coupling structure and risk sharing mechanism between farmers’ cooperatives and farmers has become an important way to break the pattern of “the strong are always strong” and “distribution failure” for supply chain members and farmers.

T1  - Tripartite Evolutionary Game of Agricultural Service Scale Management and Small Farmers’ Interests under Government Preferential Policies
AN  - 2727493284
AB  - In agricultural production with small farmers as the main body, the service scale operation is one of the ways to obtain scale operation benefits. This paper constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model of agricultural scale service providers (integrators), demand subjects (farmers), and agriculture-related government departments and analyzes the influencing factors, influencing relations, and evolutionary stable equilibrium results of each participant’s strategy choice. The results show that improving rewards and punishments and strengthening supervision by agriculture-related government departments will help integrators provide high-quality services and encourage farmers to actively produce and reduce speculation; when the cost difference between high-quality service and low-quality service is large, the probability of high-quality service provided by integrators will be reduced, and the evolution result of low Pareto efficiency may appear in the system; when the speculative cost of farmers is not high, the lobbying efforts of integrators will increase the speculative behavior of farmers. Finally, MATLAB2018a is used to simulate and analyze the validity of the model results, which provides a theoretical reference for the scale operation of agricultural services.

T1  - Drivers of Post-Harvest Aflatoxin Contamination: Evidence Gathered from Knowledge Disparities and Field Surveys of Maize Farmers in the Rift Valley Region of Kenya
AN  - 2716607273
AB  - Maize-dependent populations in sub-Saharan Africa are continually exposed to aflatoxin poisoning owing to their regular consumption of this dietetic cereal. Being a staple in Kenyan households, consumption of maize-based meals is done almost daily, thereby exposing consumers to aflatoxicoses. This study assessed awareness levels, knowledge disparities, and perceptions regarding aflatoxin contamination at the post-harvest phase among farmers in the Rift Valley Region of Kenya. Households were randomly selected using a geographical positioning system (GPS) overlay of the agro-ecological zones within Uasin Gishu and Elgeyo Marakwet counties. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in 212 smallholder and large-scale farms. The study documented the demographic profiles of farmers and knowledge, awareness, and perceptions of aflatoxin contamination using a pre-designed structured questionnaire. Most farmers were familiar with aflatoxins and the adverse effects they present to health (61.32%). Almost all the farmers (94.37%) were aware of storage molds and food-spoilage fungi. However, few farmers adopted good post-harvest practices (PHPs), such as avoiding premature harvests (49.8%), using well-ventilated storage spaces (44.6%), grain sorting (30.5%), proper drying of maize (17.8%), and using hermetic bags for storage (30.5%). Conclusively, intensified farmer education is required to train farmers on good PHPs to protect their maize from aflatoxigenic fungi and aflatoxin accumulation.

T1  - Assessing the Potential for Private Sector Engagement in Integrated Landscape Approaches: Insights from Value-Chain Analyses in Southern Zambia
AN  - 2716576771
AB  - Agricultural and forested landscapes in Africa are changing rapidly in response to socio-economic and environmental pressures. Integrated landscape approaches provide an opportunity for a more holistic and coordinated resource management strategy through the engagement of multiple stakeholders. Despite their influence as landscape actors, participation of private businesses in such initiatives has thus far been limited. This study focuses on the Kalomo District in southern Zambia, which provides an example of a rural landscape characterized by high levels of poverty, low agricultural productivity, and widespread deforestation and forest degradation. The study applied a value-chain analysis approach to better understand how the production of four locally important commodities (maize, tobacco, cattle, and charcoal) impacts land use, local livelihoods, and environmental objectives in this landscape, focusing on the role and influence of private sector actors. Data were collected through focus group discussions and key informant semi-structured interviews. Qualitative content analysis was employed to analyze the data and contextualize the findings. Results indicate three key potential entry points for increased private sector engagement: (1) improving water security for smallholders; (2) empowering small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as private sector actors; and (3) collective planning for sustainable landscape activities with deliberate measures to involve private sector actors. We discuss options for optimizing benefits from the identified entry points.

T1  - Access to Landscape Finance for Small-Scale Producers and Local Communities: A Literature Review
AN  - 2716576545
AB  - Access to finance is a key element of sustainable and inclusive landscapes. We conducted a literature review to identify the factors that contribute to or hinder inclusive financing for micro/small/medium-sized enterprises and projects across sectors in ways that collectively contribute to more sustainable landscapes in the tropics. The key factors in the design of inclusive landscape finance are landscape governance, the financial literacy of local stakeholders, access to finance technology and services, and inclusive finance facilities and associated mechanisms for integrated (i.e., multi-project, multi-sector, spatially coordinated) landscape finance. The most frequent challenges are the types of existing financial products, the lack of livelihood assets among recipients (such as capital and income), the lack of transparency in finance mechanisms, the small scale of potential business cases, and the high risks perceived by finance providers and their customers. From this review, we propose components specifically focused on financial inclusion that complement the framework for integrated landscape finance developed by the Finance Solutions Design Team for the 1000 Landscapes for 1 Billion People Initiative. We suggest how the revised framework can be applied in designing and assessing the inclusiveness of finance mechanisms for integrated landscape management and to guide further research.

T1  - The role of smallholder bean farmers in determining farm gate prices for beans in Uganda
AN  - 2715514214
AB  - Background 
Like for other agricultural commodities, the bean value chain involves a series of actors including; farmers as producers, middlemen, retailers, wholesalers and exporters. The study explains the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) marketing constraints faced by smallholder bean farmers and other actors in the bean value market chain that need redress for efficient and effective bean marketing in Uganda. Specifically, the effect of farmer bean production and marketing modes, and limited knowledge about bean market requirements on the final prices received for their beans and their limited ability to demand better prices is explained by the study. A descriptive cross-sectional design was used to collect data from 127 farmers (in strata of trained and non-trained farmers), 34 traders, five input dealers and 40 consumers, using semi structured questionnaires, and interview guides. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed using SPSS and content analysis, respectively.
 Results 
Trained farmers produced more beans in the two seasons though the mean difference was not statistically significant from the non-trained farmers. Farmers determine the quantity of beans sold and not the prices. Both trained and non-trained farmers consider the price offered by traders through consultations. Most farmers individually sold their beans with little role in determining prices. Farmers formed groups to better access inputs and improve their bargaining power. Variety, price and quality influenced consumer purchase decisions. NABE 15 K132, NABE4, Yellow and white beans were preferred varieties. Trained farmers sold beans at a higher price of USD 0.505 per kilo gram, while non-trained farmers sold at USD 0.369 per kilo gram. The records kept by majority of the farmers pertain either to dates particular activities were executed or when they received visitors, and could neither be used in determining the bean prices nor costing production.
 Conclusions 
The constraints faced by the different bean actors provide a basis for developing bean marketing models. Addressing smallholders’ marketing challenges will increase their incomes and boost production. Increase in income through increased prices for farmers will improve farmer living standards as they will be able to meet basic needs. The quantity increase in production will partly address the food insecurity problems through direct consumption and selling the excess to buy other desired foods.

T1  - Does Agroforestry Adoption Affect Subjective Well-Being? Empirical Evidence from Smallholder Farmers in East Java, Indonesia
AN  - 2706454568
AB  - Agroforestry has an essential role in reducing global poverty and maintaining environmental sustainability. However, little is known about the association between agroforestry and farmers’ welfare. This study aims to estimate the factors affecting agroforestry adoption and its impact on smallholder farmers’ welfare. The cross-sectional data were collected from 301 potato farmers in East Java, Indonesia. The factors affecting farmers’ decision to adopt agroforestry were estimated using probit regression analysis. The subjective well-being was proxied by life satisfaction and happiness. The effect of agroforestry adoption on subjective well-being was measured by propensity score matching (PSM). The findings indicated that agroforestry adoption was positively and significantly affected by whether the land is terraced, farmers’ age and education level, and farmers’ participation in social activities, cooperatives, and farmers’ groups. The PSM analysis shows that agroforestry adoption has a significant and positive impact on both subjective well-being indicators. Farmers who adopted agroforestry were happier and more satisfied than those who did not. The findings imply that farmers should implement agroforestry in the long term to improve their well-being.

T1  - Comparative Analysis of Environmental and Economic Performance of Agricultural Cooperatives and Smallholder Farmers for Apple Production in China
AN  - 2706064866
AB  - China is the world’s largest apple producer, and agricultural cooperatives play an important role in promoting sustainable production in its whole life cycle system. However, few studies on cooperatives have evaluated the environmental and economic performance from the life cycle thinking perspective. In this study, the combined methods of life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) were used to comparatively analyze the environmental and economic performance of apple production between cooperatives and smallholder farmers. The results showed that, compared to the smallholder farmers, cooperatives significantly reduced resource depletion and environmental impacts by 12.50–22.16% in each category. The total environmental index for the cooperatives was 7.44% and 22.09% lower than smallholder farmers; meanwhile, the total LCC was 2659.71 Chinese Yuan (CNY), 19.27% lower than smallholder farmers. However, the net profit was 2990.29 CNY for the cooperatives, 21.23% higher than smallholder farmers. The results indicated that cooperatives exhibited a higher net profit while having lower resource input, environmental impact, and LCC than smallholder farmers. Moreover, pesticides and fertilizers were identified as the most critical environmental hotspots. Moreover, human labor cost was the most significant contributor to the total economic cost of the apple production system. These findings provide insights into optimizing farm inputs for apple production and active participation in agricultural cooperatives to alleviate multiple environmental impacts while maintaining apple yield and improving economic benefits, intending to make a marginal contribution to promoting sustainable development of the apple industry in China.

T1  - Social networking and risk attitudes nexus: implication for technology adoption among smallholder cassava farmers in Ghana
AN  - 2704078307
AB  - Background 
Theoretically, social climate and social networking which may affect attitudes, motivations, and readiness towards quality improvement and rewards, influence the adoption decision process by possibly modifying the risk behaviour/attitudes of individuals. Thus for effective promotion of agricultural technologies among farmers in Africa, it is necessary to understand the social context within which risk attitudes are formed and social participation decisions are made. The study, therefore, employed the recursive bivariate endogenous switching probit model to examine how risk attitudes of farmers are shaped through social interactions in the information and communication networks of farmers to influence their technology adoption decisions. Here, the empirical application was done with the contextual case of agriculture intensification technologies in the Root and Tuber Improvement and Marketing Programme (RTIMP) introduced to smallholder cassava farmers in Ghana. This paper makes a contribution to recent advances in the empirical analysis of impact where anticipated problems posed by unobserved confounders are accounted for. This was possible since the approach used allows for the estimation of the treatment effect of endogenous risk attitude variable of interest on farmers’ adoption decisions.
 Results 
The study found that the effectiveness and usefulness of social interactions as well as a high degree of trust by cassava farmers in their social networks have higher tendencies to lower the degree of risk aversion behaviour of the farmers to significantly influence RTIMP Technologies adoption decisions positively. The ATE estimate confirms that there has been a significant increase of 38% probability in the likelihood of adopting agricultural intensification technologies in the RTIMP attributable to the non-risk aversion attitudes of cassava farmers. The cassava farmers’ risk attitudes were found to be significantly influenced by the effectiveness and usefulness of social interactions, and a high degree of trust as well as age, frequency of extension services, access to credit, and revenue.
 Conclusion 
By implication, attempts to introduce innovations to improve agricultural commodities value chains that target farmers must pay particular attention to the information and communication network to ensure the effectiveness and usefulness of information dissemination to farmers in an honest manner, so as to build trust; which will go a long way to reduce doubts and uncertainties (function of risk aversion). This will help achieve higher innovation adoption impacts thereby resulting in attaining the overall deliverable objectives of agricultural innovations.

T1  - Intervening in Cash Crop Value Chains for Improved Nutrition: Evidence from Rural Sierra Leone
AN  - 2698367424
AB  - Despite their economic importance, some export-oriented cash crops inherently have low nutritional value for smallholder farmers in developing countries, where the prevalence of malnutrition and food insecurity remains alarming. This paper investigates the nutritional effects of a multi-faceted nutrition-sensitive agricultural programme, uniquely designed to address food and nutrition insecurity among smallholder cocoa, coffee and cashew farmers in Sierra Leone. Estimation of programme effects is done using the inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment, which addresses potential selection bias on observables and accommodates multiple programme exposure. We do not find a positive effect on household and individual dietary outcomes of the production-focused component, unless it is complemented with nutrition education. The analysis shows that combining both cash crop production and nutrition interventions significantly improves household, maternal and children’s dietary diversity and, more importantly, the intake of micronutrient-rich foods among smallholder cash cropping households. This result holds after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity using the correlated random effects model. We found improvements in nutrition knowledge, and women’s confidence to be the potential pathways linking the combined intervention to better dietary outcomes.

T1  - Public-private strategies to establish a successful avocado export cycle: cases from Colombia
AN  - 2696872491
AB  - Purpose>The purpose of this research is to study the Colombian avocado export industry, identify key insights associated with creating and sustaining the avocado value chain, and to understand the impact of the public policies affecting this industry.Design/methodology/approach>The approach consists of two case studies to shed light on the opportunities and challenges of developing a sustainable avocado value chain in Colombia. One case deals with a vertically integrated business (Arcángel Miguel) while the other focuses on an association of small growers (Asohass). The analysis was informed by a series of interviews with key actors along the avocado supply chain to uncover the business strategies to move avocados to destination markets. The authors compare and contrast approaches to business development, international expansion, and role of public policies.Findings>The authors found that the strategies followed by these organizations differ in means but aim for the same objective: maximize profits, improve environmental performance, and enhance the social wellbeing of growers. The authors found that each type of business model requires distinct public policies to succeed and different strategies to appropriately allocate efforts. The findings are relevant to other high-value crops and other Latin American countries with similar geographical and social characteristics.Research limitations/implications>These insights underscore the need of public policies tailored to the specific needs of the different actors in the value chain. The current emphasis on certifications and export markets works well for large agribusinesses, but smallholder growers need policies tailored to new investments in physical, human, and social capital.Originality/value>This study contributes to the literature on avocado value chains in Latin America, emphasizing the challenges faced by the emergent Colombia avocado sector, a country that only began exporting this commodity in 2010.

T1  - Sustainable businesses development in post-conflict zones: a case in rural Colombia
AN  - 2696872469
AB  - Purpose>Farmers in Colombia have faced economic instability due to a long-lasting armed conflict. An attempt to support the rural community has been through the creation of productive alliances – a strategic association between small-scale producers and anchor companies with the assistance of the private and public sectors. By closely examining the Association of Guarupay Palm Growers (ASOPAY)'s financial cash flows, this study investigates the challenges faced by small-scale agribusinesses in an emerging economy.Design/methodology/approach>This study addresses the situation of ASOPAY, an oil palm productive alliance formed by families displaced by the Colombian armed conflict and relocated in the eastern foothills of the Andes Mountains. By closely examining ASOPAY's financial flows, the article sheds light on the economic incentives enhancing the cohesion of the small-farmers’ association.Findings>A key finding is the critical role played by institutional efforts focused by promoting policies to enhance producers income. In addition, technological transfers made through technical assistance programs may improve the association's profitability by enhancing agronomic practices, while decreasing palm mortality and disease incidence.Research limitations/implications>The relatively small sample used in the study might rise concerns regarding the generalization of the outcomes. However, the authors implemented strategies to overcome these limitations by incorporating the inputs from experts on the oil palm supply chain in Colombia and from experts in rural development.Originality/value>To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the financial success of small farmers in post-conflict zones.

T1  - ISU DAN CABARAN SEKTOR HULUAN DAN HILIRAN INDUSTRI SAWIT
TT  - (Issues And Challenges Faced by the Oil Palm and Palm Oil Chain)
AN  - 2688126790
AB  - Perkembangan industri kelapa sawit di Malaysia bermula pada tahun 1917 dengan pembukaan ladang sawit pertama di Tennamaran, Selangor. Seterusnya, pada awal dekad 1960-an, pembukaan ladang sawit meningkat dengan mendadak apabila FELDA membuka tanah rancangan secara besar-besaran selaras dengan dasar kerajaan pada masa tersebut untuk membasmi kemiskinan di kalangan penduduk luar bandar. Pada masa kini, kelapa sawit telah menjadi antara tanaman komoditi yang terpenting Malaysia. Rantaian nilai industri kelapa sawit terbahagi kepada tiga segmen iaitu sektor huluan, pertengahan dan hiliran. Sektor huluan terdiri daripada aktiviti penyediaan anak pokok, penanaman dan penuaian Buah Tandan Segar. Peringkat pertengahan pula adalah pengilangan yang melibatkan pemprosesan dan penapisan BTS daripada ladang atau yang diterima daripada pekebun kecil bagi menghasilkan minyak sawit mentah. Akhirnya, minyak sawit mentah akan diproses selanjutnya di peringkat hiliran bagi tujuan simpanan dan pasaran sama ada domestik atau eksport dan akhirnya sampai ke pengguna yang lazimnya adalah produk makanan. Walaupun pelbagai kejayaan yang dicapai oleh sektor sawit negara sepanjang 100 tahun industri tersebut bertapak di Malaysia, terdapat pelbagai isu dan cabaran yang dihadapi oleh industri sawit negara. Sehubungan itu, kajian ini bertujuan untuk (i) mengenal pasti isu dan cabaran utama sektor huluan, pertengahan dan hiliran kelapa sawit dan (ii) apakah usaha-usaha dan cadangan penambahbaikan yang telah dijalankan bagi mengatasi isu dan cabaran ini. Kajian ini menggunakan pendekatan kualitatif untuk menyelidik isu dan cabaran sektor huluan, pertengahan dan hiliran industri kelapa sawit melalui temu bual sebagai instrumen kajian utama dan analisis dokumen sebagai sokongan. Kajian ini mendapati bahawa antara isu utama industri sawit negara adalah kekurangan tenaga buruh, kelestarian alam sekitar perladangan dan pengilangan sawit, persepsi negatif terhadap minyak sawit daripada masyarakat antarabangsa dan halangan perdagangan. Isu dan cabaran ini perlu diatasi dengan berkesan antaranya hubungan diplomatik serta peningkatan kepercayaan konsumer terhadap produk sawit yang memerlukan pendekatan yang strategik.Alternate abstract:The development of the oil palm industry in Malaysia began in 1917 with the establishment of the first oil palm plantation in Tennamaran, Selangor. Subsequently, the establishment of oil palm plantations increased dramatically in the early 1960s when FELDA opened up large-scale plantations in line with the Government's policy to eradicate poverty. Presently, oil palm has become one of Malaysia's most important commodity crops. The value chain of the palm oil industry is divided into three segments, namely upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors. The upstream sector consists of seedling preparation activities, planting, and harvesting of fresh fruits bunches (FFBs). The midstream sector is the manufacturing process that involves the processing and refining of FFB which is harvested from the plantation or collected from smallholders to produce crude palm oil. Eventually, crude palm oil will be further treated in the downstream sector to be stored or marketed either domestically or exported before eventually reaching the consumers. The final product is usually a food product. Albeit the various successes achieved by the palm oil industry within the 100 years of progress in Malaysia, there are various issues and challenges faced by the country's palm oil industry^As such, this study aims to (i) identify the main issues and challenges of Malaysia's palm oil upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors and (ii) carry out comparisons related to the key issues and challenges of the Indonesian palm oil industry as Malaysia's main competitor. This study applied the qualitative approach in investigating issues and challenges of the upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors of the palm oil industry. In-depth, interviews were employed as the main research instrument, and document analysis was conducted to support the results obtained from the in-depth interview. The study found that among the main issues of the country's palm oil industry are labor shortages, environmental sustainability of oil palm plantation and palm oil manufacturing, negative perceptions towards palm oil from the international community, and trade barriers. These issues and challenges need to be addressed effectively, including diplomatic relations as well as increasing consumer confidence in palm oil products, which requires a strategic approach.

T1  - Creating Food Value Chain Transformations through Regional Food Hubs: A Review Article
AN  - 2686188516
AB  - This article synthesizes the evidence on food value chains (FVCs) and regional food hubs (RFHs) through a systematic literature review and suggests future research directions based on the gaps identified in the review. The number of publications on FVCs and RFHs is increasing, indicating that these topics are gaining interest among scholars from different countries and disciplines. Bibliometric analysis and preferred reporting items for systematic review and a meta-analysis (PRISMA) flow chart are used to identify the data from Scopus. The results show that FVCs are an innovative solution to improve the skills and capacity of smallholder farmers through collaborative networks that can match the functions of RFHs. RFHs connect local producers and customers by operating a business based on social entrepreneurship and ecological approaches to increase local economic viability and the sustainability of agriculture products. FVCs and RFHs are designed to respond to supply chain insecurity with value-based approaches in order to achieve sustainable nutrition for the local community. Further research on FVCs and RFHs emphasizes that the business model of regional development in developing countries can improve food security sustainability based on social entrepreneurship, and emphasizes the environmental aspect that it can use to support the sustainability of developing countries local food.

T1  - Improving Access to Export Market for Fresh Vegetables through Reduction of Phytosanitary and Pesticide Residue Constraints
AN  - 2686187700
AB  - The horticultural sector is a key contributor to Kenya’s gross domestic product through the export of fresh-cut flowers, fruits and vegetables to various niche markets. It employs over 350,000 people, while about six million depend on it. However, the sector is constrained by the strict technical and phytosanitary quality requirements set by the export markets. The phytosanitary concerns include the presence of pests and microbial contaminants, while the presence of chemical residues constitute the major technical challenge. These constraints cause the interception and rejection of produce at the export destinations. The fresh produce should be free of quarantine and regulated non-quarantine pests, pest damage, pesticides above the stipulated maximum residue levels (MRLs) and phytosanitary certification. This review discusses the following four-tiered approach to compliance with phytosanitary and pesticide residue requirements: (i) use of alternative pest management approaches, including biocontrol options, cultural and physical practices; (ii) collaboration among regulatory agencies, institutions, producers and regional countries in the enforcement of standards; (iii) investment in research and the adoption of innovative technologies; (iv) awareness creation and training of actors along the fresh vegetable value chain. It is envisaged that this approach will contribute to sustainable fresh vegetable value chains, leading to improved access to export markets, and increased export volumes and income to smallholder farmers and other actors in the fresh vegetable value chain.

T1  - Analyzing Variations in Size and Intensities in Land Use Dynamics for Sustainable Land Use Management: A Case of the Coastal Landscapes of South-Western Ghana
AN  - 2679779865
AB  - Land use/land cover change (LULCC) studies are gaining prominence among environmentalist and land use planners. This is due to the effects of LULCCs on natural ecosystems and livelihoods. In the coastal landscape of south-western Ghana, there exist knowledge gaps in the variations in size and intensities in LULCCs and the degree of change among land cover types in LULCC studies. Such studies are important for identifying periods of rapid land cover transitions and their implications on the landscape. Using change detection, intensity analysis and informal stakeholder conversations, the land use system dynamics of the study landscape was analyzed over a 34-year period to assess the variations in size and intensities in LULC transitions and its implications. The results showed a dynamic landscape driven primarily by rubber and settlement expansions. Rubber and settlement increased threefold (172.65%) and fourfold (449.93%) in the 34-year period mainly due to rubber outgrower scheme and onshore infrastructural developments, respectively. Gains in rubber and settlement targeted arable lands. The LULCC implies local food insecurity issues, declines in ecosystem services and compromised livelihoods, hence, the enforcement of the Land Use and Spatial Planning Act (2016) is recommended in land use planning in the coastal landscapes of south-western Ghana.

T1  - Backup Agreement as a Coordination Mechanism in a Decentralized Fruit Chain in a Developing Country
AN  - 2679731434
AB  - This paper aims to analyze the impacts of a backup agreement contract on the performance of a small agricultural producers’ citrus supply chain. A backup agreement contract, which ensures for each echelon that a quantity of products will be bought independently of real demand, is proposed to coordinate a three-echelon supply chain, aimed at improving income. After presenting an overview of the literature that shows various coordination mechanisms but no backup agreement proposals for supply chain coordination, this paper develops a decentralized three-echelon supply chain facing stochastic customer demand and includes the backup agreement as a coordination mechanism to guarantee a balanced relationship between the chain members. The model is tested in a real case study in Colombia, and a sensitivity analysis is provided. Results show that a backup agreement contract coordinates the small agricultural producers’ supply chain and improves income for each echelon, especially for the small producer. However, the economic mechanism complexity can limit coordination among echelons, mainly because of a lack of trust and consolidated supply capacity from small farmers. The foregoing requires the development of an associative structure by small producers, which is proposed as future research work.

T1  - Grounds for Collaboration: A Model for Improving Coffee Sustainability Initiatives
AN  - 2674417390
AB  - Smallholder coffee producers are the foundation of the specialty coffee industry and are currently facing a set of challenges that threaten the sustainability of the industry. Movement towards a more sustainable specialty coffee sector requires strong collaboration between interdisciplinary researchers and industry stakeholders to develop research projects and interventions that address critical social, economic, and environmental threats to the industry. To improve upon past sector initiatives it is essential that cross-sector collaboration better incorporate and center coffee farmers’ voices, which have often been absent from top-down interventions. This article describes one such collaboration, which investigated agronomic and market system needs of the Guatemalan smallholder coffee sector. We conducted participatory interviews with 33 coffee producers and 22 non-producer key informants, and used mixed-methods analysis of the interview data to better understand the key challenges facing smallholder coffee producers in Guatemala. The following factors emerged: pests and diseases, climate change, price, labor, nutrient management, market access, yield, nurseries and transplants, and technical assistance. Cross-sector, interdisciplinary collaborations that directly address these areas would directly improve the long-term sustainability of the coffee industry by reducing pressures currently limiting specialty coffee production. This research framework can also serve as a model for others interested in conducting interdisciplinary, cross-sector research.

T1  - Does Service Utilization Improve Members’ Welfare? Evidence from Citrus Cooperatives in China
AN  - 2674406688
AB  - Farmers’ professional cooperatives (hereinafter referred to as “cooperatives”) are an important carrier for small farmers to organically connect to the big market. Under the background of frequent phenomena such as generalization of cooperatives, cooperative alienation, empty shelled cooperatives and involution of cooperatives in China, whether cooperatives can improve members’ welfare has attracted the attention of all walks of life. Service is the essential attribute of cooperatives, and the key to the functioning of cooperatives is the services utilization by members (hereinafter referred to as “service utilization”). Therefore, examining the impact of service utilization on members’ welfare has important theoretical and practical significance, which helps to scientifically evaluate of the current value of cooperatives in China and then objectively respond to questions about the development of cooperatives. Thus, this study takes the micro-survey data of 74 citrus cooperatives and 524 citrus members in Citrus County, Sichuan Province, China as examples, and uses the endogenous switching model to empirically analyze the impact of service utilization on members’ welfare. The results show that the level of service utilization is not high, and only half of the members use cooperative services. However, service utilization can significantly improve members’ welfare. Specifically, the average treatment effect of service utilization on citrus yields, net returns and household income is respectively 285.446 kg/mu, 1290 yuan/mu and 4980 yuan/person. Simultaneously, service utilization can increase citrus yields, net returns and household income by 13.49%, 18.32% and 17.99% on average. Finally, some countermeasures and suggestions are put forward, such as actively publicizing cooperative’s services, guiding members to use cooperative’s services, improving the standardization level of cooperatives and strengthening policy support for cooperatives.

T1  - Sustainable Value Chain Financing for Smallholder Agricultural Production in the Philippines
AN  - 2672789305
AB  - Cognizant of the value, contribution, and challenges in the country's agricultural finance, the government has intensified its lending programs to help the sector, particularly smallholders, thus, boosting affordable and easy access retail lending in recent years. Despite these efforts, however, significant problems remain, including the lack of markets and low prices, which have had significant implications on the overall repayment capacity and credit rating of small farmers and fisherfolk in the Philippines. Indeed, lending programs are unlikely to become successful if financing and production are not viewed in the bigger context of value chain financing. This paper looks into the farmers and fisherfolk's financing ecosystem and provides recommendations on how the existing value chain financing in the Philippines can become more inclusive and sustainable for them.

T1  - Risk Factor Assessment of the Smallholder Baby Vegetable Production in Eswatini
AN  - 2670042510
AB  - The transition from subsistence to commercial production poses uncertainty and risks that require putting in place adaptive systems. Such systems are imperative for agricultural production where weather and food markets are always changing. Disregarding risk factors has a cumulative negative impact on the intended outcomes. The marginality of smallholder farmers’ operational environment renders them limited to strive without government interventions. Research has proven that smallholder farmers face numerous challenges in vegetable value chains. The study sought to identify and characterise smallholder growers risk factors when producing for this value chain. A sequential mixed-method research design was adopted, and data collected from fifty-eight growers from three producer groups in the Manzini and Hhohho regions. Discriminant analysis validated the heterogeneity of respondents using the experience on risk factors. The growers were significantly affected by market and production risks. The clustered growers had a high probability of losses in the value of the harvest whereas the private growers had a high probability of yield changes. Fruit size and postharvest handling contributed to changes in the value of the harvest. An improved cold chain system could enable symmetry in the harvest scheduling and grade information as well as prompt payments. Interventions toward enabling access and use of quality farm inputs would curb yield variations. Future research could quantify yield losses at each stage of postharvest handling toward informing the risk management strategy.

T1  - Small Farmers Large Field (SFLF): a synchronized collective action model for improving the livelihood of small farmers in India
AN  - 2656839468
AB  - This study pilots the collective action model “Small Farmers Large Field (SFLF)” to overcome the disadvantages faced by millions of small and marginal farmers due to diseconomies of scale and lack of bargaining power in the supply chain. This model is participatory and flexible and allows small farmers to benefit from achieving economies of scale by organizing themselves into groups and synchronizing and harmonizing selected operations. It was piloted in two villages of Odisha, an eastern Indian state, with 112 farmers (35 females and 77 males). These farmers organized themselves into groups and synchronized their operations such as nursery bed management, transplanting, and harvesting collectively to achieve economies of scale. The SFLF farmers purchased inputs (seed and fertilizer) and sold paddy as a group to increase their bargaining power in price negotiations. The results from this pilot study showed that the participating farmers almost doubled their profits. Apart from the monetary benefits, these farmers saved time in many joint activities, including input (seed and fertilizer) purchase, paddy sale, and nursery bed management. Other important benefits of the harmonization and synchronization of farming operations were social harmony and sustainability of the farming system.

T1  - Gendered Barriers and Opportunities for Women Smallholder Farmers in the Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia Vaccine Value Chain in Kenya
AN  - 2652948600
AB  - Simple SummarySmall animals such as goats, sheep and chickens are an important source of income for rural livelihoods, especially for women farmers in Africa, because they are able to control the resources that come from the sale of these animals. However, one of the biggest problems they face is livestock diseases, even when vaccines are available. In Kenya, Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP) is a highly infectious disease of goats with a mortality rate of more than 70%. A vaccine for CCPP is available but difficult to access by women in the rural areas. This study examines the gaps and barriers that prevent women smallholder farmers from effectively accessing and adopting CCPP vaccination for their animals in the Machakos district of Kenya. Our results indicate that key constraints to vaccine access and adoption for rural smallholder women farmers are lack of a cold chain for vaccine maintenance, inadequate and late delivery of veterinary services, lack of information and training, and limited financial capacity to purchase the vaccine. If more resources, information, and training is made available to women smallholder farmers through government or the private sector, there would be improved livestock productivity, better livelihoods, and increased opportunities and agency for women.AbstractMost rural women smallholder farmers in Kenya generate income from the sale of small ruminant animals. However, diseases such as Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP) prevent them from optimizing earnings. A crucial aspect for the control of CCPP is vaccination. In Kenya, CCPP vaccines are distributed through a government delivery mechanism. This study examines gaps and barriers that prevent women smallholder farmers from accessing CCPP vaccines. Qualitative data collection tools used were focus groups discussions, focus meals, jar voices and key informant interviews. Using outcome mapping (OM) methodology, critical partners and stakeholders in the CCPP vaccine value chain (CCPP-VVC) were identified to be the manufacturers, importers, distributors, agrovets, public and private veterinarians, local leaders, and farmers. Respondents highlighted the barriers to be limited access to vaccines due to cold chain problems, inadequate and late delivery of services, lack of information and training on vaccines, and financial constraints. Identified opportunities that can support women’s engagement in the CCPP-VVC are the Kenya Governments two-third gender rule, which requires that not more than two thirds of the members of elective or appointive bodies shall be of the same gender, and positive community perception of female veterinarians. We conclude that more resources and training should be made available to women farmers, and that gender perspectives on policy development related to livestock production and disease prevention are urgently needed to improve livestock productivity and increase agency for women.

T1  - Scaling Climate Smart Agriculture in East Africa: Experiences and Lessons
AN  - 2652947832
AB  - Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) responds in order to sustain agriculture under a changing environment, and is a major priority in the development sphere. However, to achieve impact at scale, CSA innovations must address agricultural systems’ context-specific and multi-dimensional nature and be purveyed through feasible scaling processes. Unfortunately, knowledge on the scaling of CSA innovations under smallholder farming systems and in the context of developing countries remains scant. Understanding scaling processes is essential to the design of a sustainable scaling strategy. This study aimed to draw lessons on scaling from 25 cases of scaling CSA, and related projects in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania implemented by public institutions, local and international research organisations, Non-Govermental Orginsations(NGOs), and community-based organisations. Generally, scaling follows a linear pathway comprising technology testing and scaling. Most cases promoted technologies and models geared towards climate change adaptation in crop-based value chains, and only a few cases incorporated mitigation measures. Efforts to engage the private sector involved building business models as a potential scaling pathway. The cases were very strong on capacity building and institutionalisation from local, national, and even regional levels. However, four critical areas of concern about the sustainability of scaling emerged from the study: (i) There is little understanding and capture of the dynamics of smallholder farming systems in scaling strategies; (ii) climate data, projections, and impact models are rarely applied to support the decision of scaling; (iii) considerations for the biophysical and spatial-temporal impacts and trade-offs analysis in scaling is minimal and just starting to emerge; and (iv) there are still challenges effecting systemic change to enable sustainable scaling. In response to these concerns, we propose investment in understanding and considering the dynamics of the smallholder farming system and how it affects adoption, and subsequently scaling. Programme design should incorporate climate change scenarios. Scaling programmes can maximise synergies and leverage resources by adopting a robust partnerships model. Furthermore, understanding the spatio-temporal impact of scaling CSA on ecological functioning deserves more attention. Lastly, scaling takes time, which needs to be factored into the design of programmes.

T1  - Antibiotic use by backyard food animal producers in Ecuador: a qualitative study
AN  - 2652306338
AB  - Background 
Antibiotics are increasingly used throughout the world in food animal production for controlling and preventing disease and for promoting growth. But this trend also has the potential for promoting antibiotic resistance, which represents a threat to human, animal, and environmental health. The use of antibiotics and the potential effects of antibiotic dependence has often been associated with large-scale food animal production. But rural households also engage in small-scale production, often operating literally in backyards. While some small-scale producers use veterinary antibiotics, many do not. This paper examines knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and agricultural practices (KAP) that represent an alternative to dependence on antibiotics.
 Methods 
Qualitative field research was based on four focus group discussions (FGDs) with non-indigenous backyard food animal producers in four communities near Quito, Ecuador and two FGDs with veterinarians. FGDs were supplemented by structured observations and key informant interviews. They were recorded with digital audio devices and transcriptions were analyzed independently by two researchers using a three-stage coding procedure. Open coding identifies underlying concepts, while axial coding develops categories and properties, and selective coding integrates the information in order to identify the key dimensions of the collective qualitative data.
 Results 
Backyard food animal producers in the Ecuadorian highlands generally do not use antibiotics while rearing small batches of animals and poultry for predominantly non-commercial household consumption. Instead, they rely on low cost traditional veterinary remedies. These practices are informed by their Andean history of agriculture and a belief system whereby physical activity is a holistic lifestyle through which people maintain their health by participating in the physical and spiritual environment.
 Conclusions 
Backyard food animal producers in the Ecuadorian highlands implement complex strategies based on both economic calculations and sociocultural underpinnings that shape perceptions, attitudes, and practices. They use traditional veterinary remedies in lieu of antibiotics in most cases because limited production of food animals in small spaces contributes to a predictable household food supply, while at the same time conforming to traditional concepts of human and environmental health.

T1  - Beyond household income: the role of commercial vegetable farming in moderating socio-cultural barriers for women in rural Nepal
AN  - 2652263444
AB  - Background 
Promoting rural women’s agricultural entrepreneurship in the Global South has become a major policy and program priority for governments and development partners. Women’s income earning is viewed as a pathway to their empowerment and gender equality. The research goal was to understand how patriarchal socio-cultural norms and practices influence women’s participation in commercial vegetable farming (CVF) in the mid-hills of Sudurpashchim Pradesh, Nepal, and identify the specific and evolving strategies that women use to negotiate these changes.
 Methodology 
Data for the study were generated through in-depth interviews with 16 smallholder couples, eight each in Dadeldhura and Achham districts. Additionally, 17 key informants who were government agency and development organization agriculture support officials at the district and national level were interviewed. Besides in-depth interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs) with women’s groups, women leaders, development actors, and government officials at district, regional, and national level were also conducted. Interview data analysis using NVivo was complemented with field notes, observations and government agency and development organization reports.
 Results 
CVF possibilities initially motivated a few women to discuss with their husbands, organize self-help groups, and seek development program subsidies. With strong support from husbands and parents-in-law, they actively engage in CVF, generate income, form cooperatives for savings and credit, and improve household food security and their own economic status. CVF-associated groups, cooperatives, meetings, exposure visits, skill development training, knowledge sharing, counseling, and advocacy are vital tools. Through them, women build self-confidence, contest and transform entrenched socio-cultural barriers, and negotiate new socio-cultural norms and practices within and outside the household. Dissolving gender stereotypes regarding the division of labor in CVF plays a significant role in encouraging more women to join CVF and increases gender parity. However, a diminishing minority of women still struggle to overcome the legacy of prior negative experiences and subconsciously fear community backlash, especially regarding extended travel outside their village.
 Conclusion 
Socio-cultural practices restricting women’s income-generating roles can be transformed through investment in women’s group initiatives, enhancing husbands’ and wives’ communication and livelihood planning, and community members increased appreciation for women’s role in contributing household income and food security.

T1  - Engaging Smallholders in Flower Agribusiness for Inclusive Rural Development: The Case of Yunnan, China
AN  - 2637798233
AB  - Serious farmland scarcities make smallholders a default mode for China’s agriculture, which makes efficient and equitable rural development a great challenge. Tensions lead to alternation between autonomous family farming and coordinated collective agriculture. Rapid urbanization since the 1980s has strongly stimulated flower-growing and agribusiness in Yunnan, China. The organization for commercial flower-farming is, however, an issue. Officially promoted for collective farming, voluntary cooperatives are wrecked by the free-riding problem. Grower associations nevertheless spontaneously emerge, with the flexible entry and exit of members without binding joint-assets and joint-ownership, which is facilitated by technological changes to the transaction. Empirical investigation in Tonghai, Yunnan, unveiled the institution of agribusiness–smallholder partnership for inclusive rural development. Smallholders have actively participated in flower agriculture, which has contributed significantly to the development of rural economies. The high casualty of micro-smallholders suggests that farm size is an important and crucial factor for sustainable farming. Effective rural development has to be supported by endogenous non-agricultural jobs so that farm size can be increased.

T1  - Digital Technology and Services for Sustainable Agriculture in Tanzania: A Literature Review
AN  - 2633332343
AB  - Digital technology has the potential to eradicate extreme poverty and food insecurity to the majority of smallholder farmers in the world. This paper aims to identify knowledge gaps on digital technology for sustainable agriculture and assess their availability to smallholder farmers worldwide. The particular case of Tanzania receives special attention. We conducted an extensive literature search from relevant databases for review. The advanced digital technology in agriculture, mostly used by large scale farmers, significantly contributes to sustainable agriculture. However, the existing digital services for smallholder farmers lack sustainability in the agriculture context and hardly meet the needs for a comprehensive set of services in a complete farming cycle. In most developing countries, Tanzania case included, digital technology and services respond to a challenge at a particular stage of the farming process or to a specific value chain. Based on this literature review, we identify inequalities among large and small farmers, as well as environmental challenges caused by ICT itself. To conclude we provide suggestions for improvements for smallholder farmers: developing a digital platform that addresses smallholder farmers’ challenges in a complete farming cycle, bringing together the stakeholders at a country level, in order to achieve sustainable agriculture and support adoption of cutting-edge digital technology. These suggestions will be the starting point for future research.

T1  - Effect of voluntary cooperativisation on livelihood capital of smallholder dairy farmers in the southwest of Bangladesh
AN  - 2633109173
AB  - This study investigated the effects of voluntary cooperativisationas conducted by the Community-Based Dairy Veterinary Foundation (CDVF) on the livelihood capital of smallholder dairy farmers. An essential part of this cooperativisation was the provision of community-based paid extension service to the farmers by the cooperative. The sustainable livelihood approach  was used to analyse livelihood capital. A simple random sampling technique was used to gather data from 255 respondents: including 15key informant interviews, 5 focus group discussions and 5 case studies. Almost all of the farmers felt that the paid service was profitable. Equal portion of farmers realised moderate (49.80%) and high gains (50.20%) from CDVF. Most significant improvements occurred in physical, financial and human capital resources. CDVF has increased production, and improved farmer-to-market linkage maximised profit and income. Farmers reinvested their improved income in physical assets development. Farmers gained considerable knowledge, skill, employment, voice, intensified social networks, green homesteads and livelihood security from the CDVF services. The complementary effect of all five forms of livelihood capital strengthened the assets pentagon of the participating farmers. Regression results affirm that gender, education, distance from CDVF centre, amount of extension communication, increased milk production and higher income are the determinants of farmers’ improved assets base. CDVF needs to professionalise its management and corporate strategy, and their successful voluntary cooperativisation model needs to be promoted and encouraged by all including the State.

T1  - Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Agricultural Food Production among Smallholder Farmers in Northern Drakensberg Areas of Bergville, South Africa
AN  - 2632183932
AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected social and economic activities in the agriculture systems. The extent of pandemic disruptions on agriculture food production systems is lamentably scanty in rural areas. A survey was carried out in the Northern Drakensberg areas of Bergville, and it assessed the impact of COVID-19 on agricultural food production in smallholder farming systems comprising crop-livestock systems. A survey was conducted using structured questionnaires that measured the impact of COVID-19 within farming operations and average crop yield trends pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19. Most farmers (77.1 to 92.4%) reported having limitations in accessing agricultural inputs of seeds, fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicated a continuous decrease in yields of maize, dry beans, and soybeans across two years of cropping seasons during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study demonstrated that COVID-19 lockdowns accompanied by movement restrictions negatively impacted food production of staple crops (maize, dry beans, soybeans) despite suitable rains received during COVID-19 production periods. COVID-19 policies and legislations sensitive to the plight of poor rural communities are necessary as these communities are more reliant on local agricultural food production for their livelihoods and income. Strong co-operations must be established among input suppliers, smallholder farmers associations, extension services, and local retailers to assist smallholders to obtain inputs at local retailers even during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.

T1  - Factors Influencing the Choice of Storage Technologies by Smallholder Potato Farmers in Eastern and Southwestern Uganda
AN  - 2632144419
AB  - Potato is a key food and cash crop in Uganda, mainly produced by smallholder farmers in the eastern and southwestern highlands of the country. This study assessed different factors influencing the choice of storage technologies by Ugandan potato farmers. Data were collected from 240 potato farmers using structured questionnaires in key potato producing districts in eastern and southwestern Uganda. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and the multinomial probit regression model. Results indicate that potato farmers have limited access to credit and adequate extension services. Furthermore, most of the potato production is sold immediately after harvest. Although significant quantities of potato are stored as food for the household and seed for the next season, very few farmers store ware potato for later sale at a higher price. The farmer households generally use light storage technologies designed for seed storage, while dark stores required for proper ware potato storage are rarely used. Results for factors influencing the choice of storage technologies were mixed, and the extent and direction of influence varied with technology. The predominant factors that positively influenced the choice of dark storage technologies or a combination of different storage technologies included monthly income from sources other than potato sales, access to storage management advice and access to credit. This study recommends enhancing farmers’ access to adequate extension services and credit to promote good ware potato storage conditions.

T1  - Impact of Market Participation on Household Food Security among Smallholder Irrigators in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
AN  - 2632144175
AB  - Food insecurity is a global challenge. The reduction of hunger is a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target widely seen as a measure for evaluating the progress of the well-being of rural people. This study aimed to investigate the impact of collective action and market participation on household food security. Data were collected using a structured survey questionnaire from 243 randomly selected households in Msinga Local Municipality. The binary probit model findings revealed that farmers’ group membership, market participation, gender, the total number of cattle owned, farm income, and credit access increased the likelihood of a food-secure household. This paper’s findings have crucial implications for the government and other development agencies for improving household food-security status. The findings identified collective action and market participation to be contributing to food-insecurity alleviation. The government and private organisations need to encourage and empower existing farmers’ groups through community mobilisation.

Many articles are directly linked with "food" and associated terms such as "nutritive", "nutrition", "dietary", and "health". Another important group is linked with (food) "production" and a range of connected terms including: "irrigation", "cultivated", "organic", "varieties", "crop", "vegetable", and "land". A third group of terms refers to the scales at which food security is considered: "household", "farmer", "farm", "smallholder", "community", "nation" and "region". A few themes of Food Security are considered: (1) food supply and demand, food prices, and global trade; (2) food security in households; (3) food production; (4) value chains and food systems; (5) the evolution of the concept of food security; and (6) global nutrition. In a last section, perspectives for Food Security are discussed along four lines of thoughts: the level of inter-disciplinary research published in Food Security; the importance of the Social Sciences for food security as a collective good underpinned by other collective goods within food systems; the balance between the Global South and the Global North in Food Security; and a warning that urgent global challenges that vitally interact with food security may be left unattended as a result of the current public health emergency.

T1  - Pre- and Post-Harvest Practices and Varietal Preferences of Tomato in Ghana
AN  - 2627844747
AB  - Tailored interventions in the tomato sector require current information on production and marketing systems along with the constraints faced by the stakeholders. We conducted this study to understand the current production practices, stakeholders’ varietal preferences, tomato market trends, and challenges along the crop’s value chains. A multistage sampling method coupled with a random walk was used to identify survey locations and identify 180 respondents across seven regions in Ghana. The study showed that tomato was predominantly produced by male (81%) and literate farmers (84%). Tomato farmers were smallholder farmers generally cultivating less than five acres. Tomato was mainly cultivated under rainfed conditions. Farmers used both bought seeds and their own saved seeds for production. Farmers in Bono, Greater Accra, and the Upper East region largely cultivated improved tomato varieties, while farmers in the Bono East region cultivated local varieties. Across the regions, being a male and having access to irrigation facilities increased the probability of using improved varieties by 19% and 51%, respectively. The most important farmer and market preference criteria included high yield, medium to large fruit size and rounded fruit shape, red color, time to maturity and disease resistance. The major production challenges of tomato production included diseases, pests, and poor access to water for irrigation. The average yield of tomato varied from 6902.26 kg/ha in the Bono Region to 16,213.98 kg/ha in Bono East. Tomato was exclusively produced for fresh market. The major marketing challenges were low producer prices, low demand for produce, and competition from other farmers. This study provides key information to improve tomato value chains and guide the introduction or breeding of improved tomato varieties.

T1  - Beyond the Gender of the Livestock Holder: Learnings from Intersectional Analyses of PPR Vaccine Value Chains in Nepal, Senegal, and Uganda
AN  - 2627435942
AB  - Simple SummaryThe peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is one of the deadliest viral diseases of small ruminants and is endemic in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. While PPR vaccination programs exist in these contexts, many factors restrict their reach and effectiveness, which go beyond the often cited financial, technological, and logistical constraints. This paper examines these less investigated factors, in particular the role of gender norms and other social and cultural factors, in affecting which livestock keepers are unable to access PPR vaccines and which groups are less reached by the vaccine distribution systems. Across three countries selected for our study, we find that, overall, women derive fewer benefits from the system than men; in addition, belonging to certain ethnic groups, being of low caste, or living in remote regions are additional markers of exclusion and marginalization from accessing livestock vaccines.AbstractThe peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a deadly viral disease of small ruminants, which are an important source of livelihood for hundreds of millions of poor smallholders throughout Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. PPR vaccination efforts often focus on overcoming financial, technological, and logistical constraints that limit their reach and effectiveness. This study posits that it is equally important to pay attention to the role of gender and other intersecting social and cultural factors in determining individual and groups’ ability to access PPR vaccines or successfully operate within the vaccine distribution system. We compare three study contexts in Nepal, Senegal, and Uganda. Qualitative data were collected through a total of 99 focus group discussions with men and women livestock keepers and animal health workers, 83 individual interviews, and 74 key informant interviews. Our findings show that there are not only important gender differences, but also interrelated structures of inequalities, which create additional sites of exclusion. However, these intersections are not generalizable across contexts—except for the intersection of gender and geographic remoteness, which is salient across vaccine distribution systems in the three countries—and social markers such as caste, ethnicity, and livelihood are associated with vulnerability only in specific settings. In order to address the distinct needs of livestock keepers in given settings, we argue that an intersectional analysis combined with context-dependent vaccination approaches are critical to achieving higher vaccination rates and, ultimately, PPR disease eradication by 2030.

T1  - LEGU-MED: Developing Biodiversity-Based Agriculture with Legume Cropping Systems in the Mediterranean Basin
AN  - 2621246862
AB  - Environmental degradation and the decrease of ecosystem service provision are currently of major concern, with current agricultural systems being a major driver. To meet our future environmental and sustainability targets a transformation of the agro-food systems and current agricultural value chain are crucial. One approach to redesign farming systems is the concept of biodiversity-based agriculture (BBA) which relies on sustainable diversification of biological components and their natural interactions in farming systems to maximize fertility, productivity, and resilience to external perturbations. Despite minimizing anthropogenic inputs, BBA is not yet able to meet all beneficial environmental objectives. BBA applied in the Mediterranean basin requires urgent innovation in approaches, methodologies, and models for small-holder traditional farming systems to ensure a stable provision of ecosystem services and better resilience to environmental stresses linked to climate change. Legumes are the backbone of the Mediterranean agro-ecosystems from ancient times, but their unique and wide biodiversity was not sufficiently valorized, especially by North-African countries. Here, we present LEGU-MED, a three-year international project funded by PRIMA initiative 2019. An international consortium was established involving five universities, 5 research institutes, and one private company from 8 countries: Italy, Germany, Spain, Algeria, Tunisia, Turkey, Lebanon, and Croatia. The main objective of this project is to put forward an international and well-integrated plan to valorize the legume agrobiodiversity of the Mediterranean in biodiversity-based farming systems and consequently enhance agro-ecosystem functions and services in the Mediterranean basin. The successful completion of LEGU-MED will have the following impacts on Mediterranean legume-based farming systems: (1) improve water use efficiency, (2) reduce the use of anthropogenic inputs through the maintenance of soil fertility, (3) enhance pollination and improve ecological connectivity with flora and fauna, (4) protect close-by wildland ecosystems, (5) enhance other ecosystem services (e.g., pest, disease, and weed suppression), and (6) provide healthier and safer protein-rich food.

T1  - Effect of socioeconomic and institutional factors and sustainable land management practices on soil fertility in smallholder farms in the Mahottari District, Nepal
AN  - 2620900467
AB  - Soil fertility decline is a serious global problem, leading to a decline in crop yields and jeopardizing household food security, particularly in developing countries. This paper examines the impact of socioeconomic and institutional factors and the adoption of sustainable land management practices on soil fertility changes on farms between 2002 and 2018 in the Mahottari District of Nepal. A household survey among 184 smallholder farmers was conducted in 2018 to complement soil survey data collected in 2002. A seemingly unrelated regression model was used to estimate factors influencing soil fertility changes between the two periods. The results showed that soil organic matter (SOM), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and soil pH increased, on average, by about 0.2%, 97 kg/ha, 4 kg/ha, and 0.5 scales, respectively, on the studied farms. The regression results indicated that extension visits and government support (free seedlings) had positive effects, while cooperative membership negatively affected soil fertility changes. Moreover, practicing fallow land use improved soil fertility changes on farms, while practicing conventional tillage using animals deteriorated soil fertility changes. The adoption of agroforestry practices positively affected changes in P and K and negatively affected SOM. Overall, this study highlighted the importance of institutional characteristics and sustainable land management practices to improve soil fertility. The policy implications of these findings for enhancing soil fertility on smallholder farms are: (1) increase the frequency of extension visits to share relevant information with farmers; and (2) incentivize farmers to adopt agroforestry and fallowing practices on their farms.

T1  - Mobile money adoption, input use, and farm output among smallholder rice farmers in Ghana
AN  - 2620038969
AB  - Financial exclusion continues to be a major challenge to smallholder farmers' participation in agricultural value chains in developing countries. Digitizing procurements and other forms of transactions using mobile money technology among value chain actors is essential for ensuring financial inclusion and enhancing agricultural value chain transformation. This study examines the factors influencing the adoption of mobile money technology and the impact of the technology on production input use and farm output, utilizing data from a cross‐sectional survey of smallholder rice farmers in northern Ghana. A linear regression with endogenous treatment effects method is employed to account for both observable and unobservable selection bias. The results reveal positive and significant marginal effect of mobile money technology on input use and farm output. Adopters of the technology applied 18% and 13% more fertilizer and herbicides, respectively than nonadopters. The output increased by about 4% for the adopters. The results also show that mobile money technology adoption, input use and farm output are significantly influenced by education, farmer‐based organization (FBO) membership, access to credit, input prices, and location fixed effects. Expansion of mobile technology networks, increased investment in education, credit facilities, and FBOs can be quite relevant in promoting the adoption of mobile money technology in Ghana.

T1  - Potential impact of groundnut production technology on welfare of smallholder farmers in Ghana
AN  - 2619736012
AB  - This study was conducted to assess the potential impact of applying a new groundnut planting density on welfare of smallholder farmers in northern Ghana. We used data from on-farm experiments, focus group discussions, and a household survey. We followed three steps in our analysis. First, we conducted cost-benefit analysis in which we showed the economic advantage of the new technology over the farmers’ practice. Second, we predicted adoption rates along timeline using the Adoption and Diffusion Outcome Prediction Tool (ADOPT). Third, using the results of the first and the second steps, we estimated the potential impact of the technology on poverty at household level using a combination of methods such as economic surplus model and econometric model. The cost-benefit analysis shows that increasing plant density increases farmers’ financial returns i.e., the benefit-cost-ratio increases from 1.05 under farmers’ practice to 1.87 under the best plant density option, which is 22 plants/sqm. The adoption prediction analysis shows that the maximum adoption rate for the best practice will be 62% which will take about nine years to reach. At the maximum adoption rate the incidence of extreme poverty will be reduced by about 3.6% if farmers have access to the international groundnut market and by about 2% if they do not have. The intervention will also reduce poverty gap and poverty severity. The results suggest that policy actions which can improve farmers’ access to the international market will enhance farmers’ welfare more than the situation in which farmers have access to domestic markets only. Furthermore, promoting a more integrated groundnut value-chain can broaden the demand base of the produce resulting in higher and sustainable impact of the technology on the welfare of groundnut producers and beyond.

T1  - Linking Smallholder Farmers to the Heilongjiang Province Crop Rotation Project: Assessing the Impact on Production and Well-Being
AN  - 2618265629
AB  - Food security and environmental protection—led by sustainable agricultural development—are key development goals of Heilongjiang Province. One of the main challenges facing the Heilongjiang Province is improving soil and livelihood by integrating smallholder farmers into the pilot crop rotation project. This paper investigates a comprehensive project—the new crop rotation pilot project in Heilongjiang (NCRPPH)—which aims to improve the livelihood of the pilot participants by involving smallholder farmers in the pilot crop rotation program and connecting them with the food industry through farmers’ cooperatives. This paper analyzes the impact of the NCRPPH on farmers’ crop rotation, grain yield, multi-agent cooperation, food security, and education based on data collected in 2019 and other retrospective information. The instrumental variable method and three different estimation strategies are used to solve the endogenous problem. The results show that the project has a vast and positive impact on the gross and net value of grain production per hectare and the share of products sold to food manufacturers through cooperatives. Regardless of the farm size, farmers have equal opportunities from which they can benefit. In addition, our analysis shows that the NCRPPH improves the educational situation and food security without affecting crop rotation practices. Finally, our research proves the effectiveness of this project.

T1  - Contract farming and everyday acts of resistance: Oil palm contract farmers in the Philippines
AN  - 2616238712
AB  - Contract violations are critical issues determining the success and sustainability of contract farming (CF). This paper challenges the common portrayal of the “powerful” company versus the “powerless” landowners/smallholders by using the literature on labour agency in global value chains to understand minor contract violations of contract farmers such, as side‐selling, refusal to harvest, and burning/felling of oil palm trees. This paper conceptualizes these violations as acts of minor agency or everyday acts of resistance. The analysis highlights how CF has created chains of dependency, in which smallholders are integrated into the modern market economy through new relations of debt and power. In response, contract farmers attempt to influence and shape the CF relation by using these different acts of minor agency. This paper finds that acts of minor agency, in the aggregate, can have important effects on contract relations, governance, and organizational structure of the chain and has the potential to lead to broader changes in the underlying social relations of contract. It highlights how individual acts of minor agency may contribute to the development of a consciousness of collective opposition to the contract relation.

T1  - Formal and informal contract farming in Mozambique: Socially embedded relations of agricultural intensification
AN  - 2616238709
AB  - This paper explores the role of contract farming arrangements in agricultural intensification in sub‐Saharan Africa, combining secondary literature and original case material from Mozambique. The paper extends the scope of “contract farming” beyond the formal contracts between large companies and small‐scale producers to include less formal credit agreements between farmers and traders. It argues that such informal contract arrangements are evidence of farmers' agency in “real markets.” In the studied cases, farmers use contract farming opportunities to intensify agricultural production by investing in irrigation and inputs. While informal contracts typically concern locally consumed crops, thus with more possibilities for side selling than formal contracts for export crops with company‐controlled markets, informal contract compliance reflects closely knit social ties between the contracting parties. In both formal and informal contracts, purchasers tend to seek out producers who are already irrigating, thus obtaining gains from farmers' earlier investments. This also implies contract farming as a mechanism for accelerating social differentiation arising from unequal access to irrigation. The paper argues that the significance of informal contracts in the studied cases raises the possibility that informal contract farming by local traders plays a more important role in agrarian transformation in Africa than formal contract farming by large companies.

T1  - The fragmented politics of sugarcane contract farming in Uganda
AN  - 2616238269
AB  - In the last decade, contract farming has regained momentum among policymakers and global development agencies as a tool to promote inclusive rural development and responsible investments. Integrating smallholders within global, regional and national agricultural value chains, we are told, represents the sine qua non for alleviating rural poverty. In Uganda, under the label of out‐grower schemes, contract farming is currently undergoing massive expansion, driven especially by the boom in sugarcane cultivation. Drawing from three case studies of sugarcane contract farming in Uganda, the paper re‐politicizes the debate around contract farming by looking at the power relations within which these schemes are embedded. We argue, what is seen in Uganda's expansion is a political dynamic derived both from the major dislocations and dispossessions required to establish the plantation estate and its work force, as well as from the effort to bring many smallholders using unimproved methods on land with sometimes unclear tenure arrangements into contracted arrangements for supplying sugarcane. The result has been highly contentious politics around sugar's expansion, where struggles over land dispossession merge with those around exploitative wage labour, around the loss and transformation of livelihoods, and around debt, power inequalities and environmental harm, a matrix in which state violence and co‐optation are ever‐present.

T1  - What kind of labour regime is contract farming? Contracting and sharecropping in Java compared
AN  - 2616238262
AB  - This article compares contract farming with share tenancy, another labour regime in which smallholder farmers are bound by contract to deliver produce to another, usually more powerful party. Based on research in the Javanese village of Kaliloro, we explore contracting and sharecropping as labour regimes, each with their own specific mechanisms of surplus transfer from producers to non‐producers. The cases compared are sharecropping of irrigated rice, contract farming of watermelon, and contract farming of poultry. There are important differences in how labour inputs are organized, how decisions are made, how costs are divided between landowner/contractor and farmer, and in the mechanisms of surplus transfer between the contracting parties. Exploring these differences allows us to understand and compare the role of the two labour regimes in the penetration of capital into the rural economy. Neither contract farming nor share tenancy are in themselves “win‐win” or “win‐lose” relationships, good or bad for small‐scale cultivators. The actual balance of burdens and benefits—often contravening the provisions of written contracts or state regulation—is determined by power relations between the contracting parties.

T1  - Do rice varieties matter? Climate change adaptation and livelihood diversification among rural smallholder households in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam
AN  - 2610242941
AB  - While it is known that the threat of climatic stresses induces rural smallholders to diversify their livelihood strategies, a consensus has not been reached as to what type of stress induces which strategy, especially in the Mekong Delta Region (MDR) of Vietnam. Primary data were obtained from randomly selected 405 households producing rice (Oryza sativa L.) in three provinces in the MDR. Simpson’s diversity index was used to assess the level of diversification, multivariate probit regression was utilized to examine the factors affecting farmers’ adoption of livelihood strategies, and tobit regression was employed to examine the factors influencing the extent of farmers’ diversification. The index showed relatively low levels of livelihood diversification in the study area. The results of the multivariate probit regression analysis of four livelihood strategies indicated that farmers who were exposed to drought or flood were more likely to cultivate conventional rice varieties than newer cultivars, likely because the newer varieties accessible in the study areas were of the resource-using type that were high-yielding under favorable conditions but susceptible to environmental stresses. Furthermore, those prone to salinity intrusion tended to engage in off-farm income opportunities. In addition, the results of the tobit regression analysis exhibited significant effects of asset endowment, extension services, public transport availability, agricultural inputs, and cooperative membership on the extent of livelihood diversification. To enhance rural livelihoods in the MDR, intervention programs should ensure to provide the resource-saving type of improved varieties as well as promote off-farm employment in salt-affected areas.

T1  - Boost incentives to grow agro-industrial parks – report
AN  - 2705387593
AB  - Agro-industrial parks are dedicated business areas that focus on processing farm produce, and on farming inputs such as fertilisers, according to the new study released by the Commercial Agriculture for Smallholders and Agribusiness (CASA) programme The World Bank says that COVID-19 led to “severe and widespread increases in global food insecurity, affecting vulnerable households in almost every country, with impacts expected to continue into 2022 and possibly beyond”.

According to data from the analysis group AgFunder, India saw funding for agri-food technology rise from US$619 million during the first half of 2020 to US$2 billion in the first half of 2021, underlining the growing potential of the sector.

CASA says that agro-industrial parks are “complex, long-term projects that require strategic and policy continuity and alignment between – and contributions from – numerous stakeholders, including government bodies, financiers, private sector actors, civil society organisations and external supporters”.

Since agro-industrial parks are capital-intensive projects that typically take ten years to be fully established and generate significant public and private revenues, large-scale public funds may need to be mobilised to finance the project as well as co-financing via public-private partnerships, the paper says.

T1  - Food security effects of smallholders’ participation in apple and mango value chains in north-western Ethiopia
AN  - 2729509567
AB  - BackgroundWhile it has identified that linking smallholders in the agri-food value chain remains to be a promising strategy to get out of the poverty trap in many developing countries, less is known about the food security implications of smallholders’ participation in the fruits value chain. This paper examines the effects of apple and mango smallholder farmers’ participation along the value chain, focusing on their household food security in north-western Ethiopia.MethodsPrimary data for the study were obtained from a random sample of 384 households, 211 of which are fruit value chain participants, and the remainder are non-participants. The study used the propensity score matching (PSM) method to establish a causal relationship between the participation of the fruit value chain and changes in household food security.Results and conclusionsResults indicate that participation in the apple and mango value chain has a robust and positive effect on the food security of smallholders as measured by household food consumption in kilocalorie. The unconfoundedness and overlapping assumptions were fulfilled by applying the nearest neighbor and kernel-based matching algorithms. The study confirms that the more apple and mango farmers join the value chain, the higher their household food intake becomes. Support for fruit farmers is, therefore, a promising policy approach that can help improve household food security in rural Ethiopia.

T1  - Does commitment to cooperatives affect the economic benefits of smallholder farmers? Evidence from rice cooperatives in the Western province of Zambia
AN  - 2610264338
AB  - Using local provincial authorities, the government of Zambia has demonstrated renewed interest in cooperatives as a means of reaching smallholder farmers in rural areas. There exists, however, the problem of high heterogeneity within cooperatives regarding members’ commitment, with many passive members holding only formal membership and having a minimal understanding of the cooperative's principles and benefits. The main objective of this study was to analyse how varying levels of members’ commitment determine their economic benefits. We selected a total of 215 rice farmers (72 active and 143 passive members) from two rice-dominant districts and used the propensity score matching technique and endogenous treatment regression model for the analysis. The study results show that educational level, distance to the cooperative, members’ perception about trust and acceptance, and value of the investment in the cooperative have a considerable influence on member commitment. The results further indicate that actively committed members of the cooperative achieve much more economic benefits than passive members.

T1  - Can fruit and vegetable aggregation systems better balance improved producer livelihoods with more equitable distribution?
AN  - 2606199821
AB  - The need for food systems to generate sustainable and equitable benefits for all is a global imperative. However, whilst ample evidence exists linking smallholder farmer coordination and aggregation (i.e. the collective transport and marketing of produce on behalf of multiple farmers) to improved market participation and farmer incomes, the extent to which interventions that aim to improve farmer market engagement may co-develop equitable consumer benefits remains uncertain. This challenge is pertinent to the horticultural systems of South Asia, where the increasing purchasing power of urban consumers, lengthening urban catchments, underdeveloped rural infrastructures and inadequate local demands combine to undermine the delivery of fresh fruits and vegetables to smaller, often rural or semi-rural markets serving nutritionally insecure populations. To this end, we investigate the potential for aggregation to be developed to increase fruit and vegetable delivery to these neglected smaller markets, whilst simultaneously improving farmer returns. Using an innovative system dynamics modelling approach based on an aggregation scheme in Bihar, India, we identify potential trade-offs between outcomes relating to farmers and consumers in smaller local markets. We find that changes to aggregation alone (i.e. scaling-up participation; subsidising small market transportation; mandating quotas for smaller markets) are unable to achieve significant improvements in smaller market delivery without risking reduced farmer participation in aggregation. Contrastingly, combining aggregation with the introduction of market-based cold storage and measures that boost demand improves fruit and vegetable availability significantly in smaller markets, whilst avoiding farmer-facing trade-offs. Critically, our study emphasises the benefits that may be attained from combining multiple nutrition-sensitive market interventions, and stresses the need for policies that narrow the fruit and vegetable cold storage deficits that exist away from more lucrative markets in developing countries. The future pathways and policy options discovered work towards making win–win futures for farmers and disadvantaged consumers a reality.

T1  - Seed value chain development in the Global South: Key issues and new directions for public breeding programs
AN  - 2605153826
AB  - Where CGIAR breeding programs rely on the private sector for the multiplication and distribution of improved cultivars, persistent challenges have dampened their impact on varietal adoption and turnover rates. Part of the problem is that research and practice in CGIAR and among its national breeding program partners tend to treat the private sector as a vehicle for seed delivery, rather than as commercial businesses facing a range of unique constraints and threats. This paper adopts a value chain framework to examine these relationships and pathways for improved varietal adoption/turnover outcomes in three cases: hybrid maize, farmed fish, and rice. In the first two cases, weak incentives and high risks left seed companies reluctant to invest in the marketing and quality assurance efforts needed to realize near-term impacts at scale from breeding investments. In the third case, seed companies played an insignificant role: grain traders supplied certified seed to smallholders, potentially prioritizing consumers’ quality preferences over climate-resilience and stress-tolerance traits for farmers. The findings raise important questions about the role of CGIAR and national breeding programs; specifically, how these programs can effectively support the private sector to deliver impact at greater scale, how consumer preferences are captured in trait prioritization within breeding programs, and what types of incentive mechanisms can be changed within breeding programs to advance a genuine shift towards ‘demand-oriented’ plant breeding.

T1  - Corporate social responsibility and the role of rural women in strengthening agriculture-tourism linkages in Nigeria’s oil producing communities
AN  - 2602863349
AB  - ABSTRACTThis paper extends and contributes to the literature on tourism for transformative and inclusive growth from the corporate social responsibility (CSR) perspective. Specifically, we examine the impact of CSR of multinational oil companies (MOCs) on empowerment of rural women in strengthening agriculture-tourism linkages in Niger Delta region of Nigeria. A total of 800 rural women were sampled across the region. Results from the use of a logit model indicates that rural women seldom participate in the global memorandum of understandings (GMoUs) interventions in agritourism value chain projects, due to the norms and culture of the rural communities. This implies that if the tradition of the people continues to hinder direct participation of the rural women from GMoUs programmes, achieving gender equality and cultural change would be limited in the region, and rural women would remain excluded from the economic benefits of agritourism when compared with the male counterparts. The finding suggests that, GMoU interventions engaging women smallholders in the tourism value chain can be important vehicle for advancing gender empowerment and fostering social inclusion. Also, cluster development boards (CDBs) should pay close attention to which extent the participation of rural women in the GMoUs projects may be limited by traditions.

T1  - Economics of contracts in African food systems: evidence from the malt barley sector in Ethiopia
AN  - 2550562735
AB  - Foreign direct investment (FDI) facilitates modernization of domestic agri-food systems in emerging economies through increased use of vertical coordination. This paper sheds lights on how international brewer investments in African food systems affect smallholder market participation and value chain development. In particular, we analyze the impact of contracts among malt barley producers in Ethiopia. Using cross-sectional survey data, we employ inverse probability-weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) and propensity score matching (PSM) techniques to analyze the economic impact of contracting. We find that contrary to popular belief, contracting has positive and significant impact on malt barley production, intensification, commercialization, quality improvement, and farm gate prices, ultimately resulting in increased net income and spillover into the productivity of other food crops.

T1  - Agricultural value chain financing: a case study in Ciamis District, West Java Province
AN  - 2600970256
AB  - Smallholding farmers frequently deal with shortage of working capital to cover farm costs. Given the applied terms and conditions, a lot of farmers unable to access the current People’s Business Credit (KUR), while a holistic value chain financial support is required to achieve sustainable food production. Limited capacity of formal rural-based financial institutions encourages the local money lenders to take opportunity of financially support the farmers. In response to this issue, a case study was conducted in Ciamis District, West Java Province. Primary data was collected using an interview technique. Data were organized, processed, an interpreted using a descriptive type of analysis. The study revealed that the rice farmers need an inclusive credit support from pre-planting to post-harvest and marketing of their products. Farmers require working capital to continue their farm activities and to support value chain financing of the agribusiness. Although the existing local micro financial institutions showed good performance, however they lacked fund and access to formal financial institutions such as banks or CSR soft loans. Government is suggested to strengthen the existing local micro financial institutions by linking them to sources of funds and to support business to business relations for better service to smallholding farmers. Inclusive value chain financing implies that farmers, micro financial institutions, and local governments are strongly integrated to achieve better farm performance. Ministry of Agriculture has a strategic role to take initiative to strengthening an inclusive agricultural value chain financing on the existing local micro financial institutions.

T1  - Factors explaining postharvest loss of hot pepper under tropical conditions
AN  - 2575720542
AB  - Major loss of hot pepper (Capsicum chinense Jacquin) in the humid tropics is due to disease and spoilage during postharvest storage following harvest occurring when conditions are cool and damp. The study assessed socio-economic drivers of postharvest loss of hot pepper in the tropics in order to provide empirical information on the underlying causes of postharvest losses of hot pepper for efficient and sustainable hot pepper value chain policies under tropical conditions. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, gross margin analysis and binary logistic regression. Although Capsicum chinense had a low yield in the sub-humid region, it was profitable. Being a male, primarily engaged in farming, reduced the likelihood of high postharvest loss, while long distances and high transportation costs increased it. Technical and marketing support for smallholder farmers, especially females, could reduce postharvest loss of hot pepper.

T1  - Trust and knowledge contribution to agricultural cluster performance
AN  - 2661377153
AB  - Purpose>This paper aimed to analyze the contribution of the interorganizational relationship (IOR) factors trust and knowledge resources to the relational and transactional performance of a Brazilian agricultural cluster formed by small farmers.Design/methodology/approach>A survey was conducted using a questionnaire divided into groups of variables, each group seeking to identify one of the three constructs: trust, knowledge resources and relational and transactional performance. A theoretical framework was elaborated and later compared with survey results, which were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and partial least squares–structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).Findings>Correlations between trust and relational and transactional cluster performance varied according to actors involved, being significant between some actors and not significant between others. Knowledge resources, on the other hand, proved to be significantly relevant for cluster performance, considering both relational and transactional measures.Research limitations/implications>It was made in a Brazilian single cluster and its conclusions cannot be generalized.Practical implications>Farmers cannot innovate with the efficiency and effectiveness that the process demands. They need complementary capacity that apparently is not in the agricultural cluster. Research and development involve knowledge and techniques that empirical knowledge alone may not provide. And much of the formal knowledge is embedded in universities and research institutes. If there were investments by public entities in research and development to improve the culture and its by-products, this could contribute to improving the income of farmers.Social implications>This study provided a photograph of the current scenario of a Brazilian agricultural cluster. Changes in trust and knowledge resources could affect cluster relational and transactional performance. Special attention is deserved to the important role of scientific research on agricultural clusters to strengthen the capacity of critical analysis by the researcher who, with the results in hand, makes them public, hoping that the shared information can contribute with the research of other scholars and improve the quality of life of farmers involved.Originality/value>This study offers empirical evidence that trust and knowledge resources can contribute to a Brazilian agricultural cluster performance, which can be analyzed considering both relational and transactional measures. These findings brought new fact to Singh and Shrivastava’s (2013) research.

T1  - THE ECONOMICS OF COMMUNAL SMALLHOLDER FARMING WITHIN SOUTH AFRICA'S HISTORICAL AGRICULTURAL STRUCTURE
AN  - 2623612065
AB  - South Africa's communal farming possesses a realistic potential for commercial viability and sustainability, but that its capacity is impaired because the "historical structure " of agriculture remains unreformed with concentrated and verticalized, yet paradoxically dynamic and complex, agricultural materials, institutions, and ideational regimes. The absence of commercial viability and sustainability of communal farming in South Africa is generally blamed on the lack of government support, especially regarding financing of the farming activities. The lack of government financing for smallholder farming is a symptom of a deeper root cause because increased financing addresses materials, which is only one of the three characters of the historical forces of agricultural regimes and value chains. The irony is that agricultural financialization has in reality provided liquidity that exacerbated commodification of agricultural production and the "insertion" as well as conversion of productive smallholder farming activities into large-scale commercial farming monocultures. The paper adopts theoretical foundations of agricultural financialization which reveal that smallholder farming in developing economies such as South Africa leads to financialized farmlands and financialized commodities in global derivative markets. Agricultural financialization has served to strengthen "concentration and verticalization" of agriculture, thereby re-orientating productive smallholder farming activities towards global markets, stifling entry, commercial viability, and sustainability. That is, financialization of smallholder farmlands inevitably leads to financialized commodities and insertion into global derivative markets through "integration" into largescale commercial farming. Agricultural financialization does not transform the institutions and ideational nature of the "historical structure " of the agricultural regime and value chains. It is recommended that government financing of communal smallholder farmlands need to be accompanied by concomitant restructuring of the state-agricultural business relations as well as the reconfiguration of the public institutions-private business actors' relations, which are central to the upward influence upon the global agricultural markets. In practical policy terms, the state has to protect smallholder farmlands from speculative financialization, both public and private. The creation of communal smallholder farmlands corridors needs to be insulated from large-scale commercial farming in order that commodities produced therefrom do not become secondary players in global derivative markets.

T1  - Factors influencing the level of vegetable value chain participation and implications on smallholder farmers in Swayimane KwaZulu-Natal
AN  - 2600348445
AB  - Governments in less developed countries have identified the need to support smallholder farmers and intervene to alleviate poverty and positively contribute to household food security. In Africa, there has been a growing emphasis on value chain development so that smallholder farmers can benefit from participation in agricultural value chains. Smallholder farmers are however still faced with constraints that negatively influence their participation decisions and the level of participation in agricultural value chains. This study, therefore, investigated the factors that influence the level of value chain participation and implications on smallholder farmers in KwaZulu-Natal, Swayimane area. Primary data was collected from farming households selected through a purposive sampling technique. The data were analyzed using descriptive analysis and the nehurdle model. Results from the nehurdle model showed that the age of the respondent, marital status, farm income, household size, cooperative, market information, radio, extension officer, and formal education significantly influenced the participation decisions of smallholder farmers in agricultural value chains. The results further showed that off-farm income, marital status, cooperatives, access to credit, access to irrigation scheme, radio, extension officer, contact with non-government organizations, and formal education significantly influenced the level of value chain participation of the smallholder farmers. It can be concluded that the level of endowment in the physical, financial, and human resources influence participation. Further, the farmer's connectivity with the external world outside the village improves the outcomes and level of success. It is recommended that a market-led approach to farmer development be adopted to improve the commercial prospects of farmers whilst bolstering food security.

T1  - IMPACT OF CONTRACT FARMING ON SMALL FARMERS' INCOME – LEARNINGS FROM A META - ANALYSIS
AN  - 2585480814
AB  - The role of contract farming in increasing the economic condition of farmers is a focus area for the government, academics and media, particularly in the context of developing countries for some time. Several studies have been conducted but there is no consensus on this debatable issue. These studies are mostly single study. Campbell collaboration recently has conducted a meta-analysis considering large number of systematic reviews and single studies conducted across several countries. The report has been critically reviewed and the present paper is based on this critical review findings. The report indicates that contract farming is beneficial for large farmers but to what extent the small farmers are affected is not clear.

T1  - Does cooperative membership impact the yield and efficiency of smallholder farmers? Evidence from potato farmers in Mongolia
TT  - Yield and efficiency of smallholder farmers
AN  - 2582675282
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on potato production and technical efficiency.Design/methodology/approachA combination of propensity score matching technique and sample selection stochastic frontier framework that addresses potential selection bias due to observable and unobservable attributes is used to estimate the effect of participation between cooperative members and non-members. Using a stochastic meta-frontier approach, the technical efficiency of farmers was estimated and compared.FindingsThe empirical results show that the effect of participation in agricultural cooperatives is associated with increased yield and technical efficiency. A comparison of group-specific frontiers indicates that cooperative members perform better than non-members. Cooperative membership decisions is significantly associated with household and farm characteristics (e.g. education, participation in off-farm work, total farmland, distance to market and geographic location).Practical implicationsThe findings of this study demonstrate that cooperative organisations can be an important tool to enhance the productivity and efficiency of smallholder farmers. Successful cooperative models together with training programs designed to enlighten farmers on the importance and tangible benefits of collective action should be used to enlarge participation in cooperative organisations. In addition, governments and development agencies should implement targeted investment and capacity building programs related to irrigation management, gender-sensitive awareness and development of the internal institutional mechanisms in cooperatives for the transfer of knowledge and mutual learning so that all members benefit from cooperatives.Originality/valueDespite the pervasive evidence of the impact of cooperatives on productivity and technical efficiency in the Asian region, this study is probably the first attempt in the crop sector in Mongolia. It provides a rigorous empirical analysis of the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on potato production and technical efficiency through a counterfactual design.

T1  - Let the farmer decide: examining smallholder autonomy in large-scale land acquisitions with an agent-based model
AN  - 2580688278
AB  - Large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) can facilitate agricultural intensification in low- and middle-income countries, but they frequently dispossess smallholders of their land and thereby generate tradeoffs between market-oriented production and smallholder livelihoods. Given the global prevalence of LSLAs, it is important to understand how they can be structured to reconcile these goals. This paper focuses on contract farming (CF) as a means to reorient LSLAs to more effectively support smallholder land rights and food security. We develop an agent-based model of mixed crop-livestock smallholder livelihoods and calibrate it using household survey data from four LSLAs in Ethiopia. We apply the model to examine smallholder food security and regional productivity under three conditions representing increasing smallholder autonomy over land management: LSLA with smallholder displacement, LSLA with forced CF, and opt-in CF. Our modeling results indicate that supporting smallholder land rights through CF can mitigate the tradeoffs generated by LSLA-induced displacement. LSLAs that implemented a CF scheme improved food security and generated comparable productivity increases to LSLAs with displacement. Further, allowing smallholders to decide whether to participate in a CF scheme (i.e. avoiding land acquisition) resulted in greater alignment between the two outcomes, particularly due to improved food security for poorer households. Our results suggest that to realize these benefits it is important to ensure contract compliance and thereby maintain smallholder trust in the contracting firm. Thus, LSLA governance that fosters smallholder agency, empowerment, and security of land rights could contribute to sustainable development.

T1  - COVID-19 lockdown and the forestry sector: Insight from Gandaki province of Nepal
AN  - 2580351767
AB  - Almost all countries have imposed large-scale mobility restrictions (or lockdown) to stop the spreading of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The mobility restriction has disrupted all types of business; causing a devastating impact on countries' economies; and pushing millions of people into extreme poverty. Scientists have been assessing the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on various fronts but there is limited scholarship in the forestry sector. We navigated the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the forestry sector by taking Gandaki Province (21,974 km2) of Nepal as a case. Employing semi-structured interviews (n = 62) with all ten stakeholder groups, literature review and media analysis, our study revealed that the COVID-19 lockdown suspended all types of forestry and ecotourism businesses; obstructed research and monitoring activities; halted capacity development and extension services; impacted forest development work; and increased incidences of illegal logging and poaching and trafficking of wildlife. Because of the complete shutdown of businesses, the forestry sector of Gandaki province lost 9.6 million USD and 3.2 million man-days of employment during the lockdown period. The economic cost of the lockdown was 1.73 million USD for NTFPs traders, 1.26 million USD for ecotourism entrepreneurs, 0.55 million USD for the community forest user groups and 0.24 million USD for the smallholder or private forest owner. We suggested four post-COVID recovery pathways, including sustainable forest management, nature-based tourism, improvement of forest products value chain and community-based natural resource management to bounce back from the loss. As the current pandemic is most likely to derail the Sustainable Development Pathways of several countries, including Nepal and necessitates the need for an immediate response, the finding and recommendation of our study may inform decision-makers to reimage post-pandemic recovery and leverage sustainable development.

T1  - The Potency of Quality Incentives: Evidence from the Indonesian Dairy Value Chain
AN  - 2569540121
AB  - Misalignment of quality incentives along value chains may limit quality and therefore function as a barrier to smallholder participation in modern value chains. This article uses survey and administrative data to study how individual quality incentives provided by private actors can help smallholders to improve milk quality. By matching farmers on baseline characteristics, I find that individual quality incentives increased the compositional quality of milk quickly after its introduction. Together with physical inputs and training, individual quality incentives also increased the hygienic quality of milk. Decreasing hygienic quality over time by treated farmers suggests that the impact of the intervention decreased over time.

T1  - The benefits and limitations of agricultural input cooperatives in Zambia
AN  - 2562924203
AB  - Policymakers in Southern Africa have long viewed agricultural cooperatives as a way to reach rural households more easily, but because not all rural households can afford to join cooperatives, this raises questions about membership inclusivity and whether cooperatives advantage some smallholders over others. Agricultural cooperatives can serve as an institutional vehicle for policymakers to deliver direct benefits to smallholder farmers in the form of subsidized agricultural inputs, usually improved seed varieties and fertilizers. They can also serve as platforms for collective action through which smallholders can reduce transportation and transaction costs or disperse the costs of marketing. In Zambia farmers are required to join a cooperative to qualify for seed and fertilizer support through the national Farmer Input Support Program (FISP), which is a structural incentive for cooperative membership and makes it complicated to determine if cooperative membership increases use of inputs and yields on its own. Using the Inverse Probability Weight Regression Adjustment (IPWRA) technique, we find Zambian smallholders participating in cooperatives achieve significantly higher maize yields and use significantly more hybrid-maize seed and fertilizers, even when controlling for FISP eligibility. Furthermore, across all selected productivity and input variables we find greater average treatment effects from cooperative membership than FISP participation. Cooperative membership is also associated with more assets, more land, and higher maize yields, which suggests that the poorest rural households are often not cooperative members. Cooperatives can be a powerful poverty policy tool to deliver direct benefits to small farmers, but not including the poorest households likely widens the rural poverty gap, both in terms of limited direct benefits of input support programs and in terms of farmers missing out on cooperative-specific benefits.

T1  - Are land-poor youth accessing rented land? Evidence from northern Ethiopia
AN  - 2577527825
AB  - Continued population growth in densely populated parts of Sub-Saharan Africa makes it harder for youth to choose agriculture as main source of income. We investigate whether near landless youth can access rented land as a source of income. We used data collected in 2016 (from 1138 youths in 119 youth business groups) and 2019 (from 2427 youths in 246 business groups), in five districts of Tigray region of Ethiopia. We find that 42% of the youth had access to rented land in 2016 and 47% in 2019. The average area rented land was 0.66 ha in 2016 and 0.74 ha in 2019. Access to rented land, though constrained, accounted close to 70% in 2016 and 61% in 2019 of the average operated land by youth group members. Male youth who own oxen and ploughs are much more likely to rent land whereas female youth group members appeared generally disadvantaged in their access to rented land and other complementary sources of income. Sharecropping dominated as the main from of land rental contract covering 94% of the contracts in 2016 and 90% of the contracts in 2019. Utilizing a trust game to elicit trust and trustworthiness of the youth, we found a positive association between trustworthiness and particularly accessing land from non-relatives. The prohibition of land sales limits the potential of the "agricultural ladder" to facilitate youth climbing out of poverty through purchase of land. Overall, the land rental market has become more important for land access of land-poor youth and is likely to grow in importance to facilitate rural transformation and diversification of rural livelihoods as land scarcity grows and market access improves. Thus, it appears that the land rental market has helped many of these very land-poor youth to establish sustainable land-based livelihoods. While the land rental market does not function perfectly, we recommend not to intervene to change the fundamental characteristics or to impose area restrictions in the market as has been attempted recently in Ethiopia. Such restrictions can easily cause more harm than good.

T1  - ‘It’s up to the market to decide’: Revealing and concealing power in the sustainable tea supply chain
AN  - 2565420700
AB  - In 2007, Unilever, the world’s largest tea company, announced plans to source its entire tea supply sustainably, beginning with the certification of its tea producers in East Africa to Rainforest Alliance standards. As a major buyer of Kenyan tea, Unilever’s decision pushed tea producers across Kenya to subscribe to Rainforest Alliance’s sustainable agriculture standard in order to maintain access to the global tea market; according to a 2018 report, over 85% of Kenya’s tea producers were Rainforest Alliance certified. Drawing on ethnographic material among supply chain actors across different sites along the sustainable tea value chain (from those designing and disseminating standards to tea traders to smallholder tea farmers), this article examines how these actors frequently attributed the power to determine the outcomes of certification to a faceless ‘market’. Deferring to ‘the market’, we observe, served primarily to mask the outsized power of lead firms (in particular Unilever) to determine conditions of tea production and trade. At the same time, ‘the market’ was also in some cases qualified by our interlocutors, allowing them implicitly (and at times explicitly) to reveal power and give it a face. Concealing and revealing power in this way, we suggest, can be seen as a mode of engagement among supply chain actors operating in ‘sustainable’ supply chains, like the Rainforest Alliance-certified Kenyan tea supply chain, in which the power of lead firms tends to be consolidated through market-driven sustainability initiatives. Such a mode of engagement mitigates exclusion from sustainable supply chains while maintaining space for critique.

T1  - What factors influence smallholder farmers’ decision to select a milk marketing channel in Zambia?
AN  - 2563579031
AB  - Farmers are faced with computational and informational limitations when making marketing decisions. This holds true for Zambian dairy farmers. This study examined the factors that influence the choice of milk marketing channels among 251 smallholder farmers in Zambia participating in milk production and marketing using a multinomial logit model approach. Three milk marketing channels were identified: direct, traditional, and modern. Relative to the base category (direct), the results indicate that gender and volume of milk produced positively influenced participation in the traditional marketing channel. However, off-farm income had a negative influence on the selection of the traditional marketing channel. Gender, education, distance to major markets, and volumes of milk produced influenced the decision to participate in the modern marketing channel. There seems to be an underutilisation of the modern marketing channel. The study identified the following factors to stimulate participation in the modern marketing channel: (i) concerted value chain investments, (ii) government intervention in the form of policy changes, (iii) increased access to market information, (iv) support services, and (v) transparency in the milk value-chain. Understanding the factors that influence farmers' participation in the informal channels enables tailored policies to support the formalisation of existing structures in the informal sector.

T1  - The farmer’s battlefield: traditional ecological knowledge and unexploded bombs in Cambodia
AN  - 2561677967
AB  - What role does traditional ecological knowledge play in the lives of smallholder farmers in post-conflict communities as they cope with the destructive impacts of war? In many cases, military weapons, such as unexploded bombs, are left behind in the surrounding landscape, forcing farmers to adapt their livelihood practices to the increased risk of death and injury. We analyze trends in the local production of knowledge in Ratanak Kiri province, Cambodia, an area heavily bombarded by the US Air Force during the Vietnam War. We argue that the system of traditional ecological knowledge has adapted to include basic information on bomb identification, location, and management strategies. This factual approach gives individuals the flexibility to generate their own views on whether they perceive unexploded ordnance as a violent hazard and/or an economic commodity. In a relatively short 50-year time period, the body of knowledge has been quickly accumulated and culturally transmitted to family and neighbors. Our findings suggest that traditional ecological knowledge should not be reduced to a static and ancient form of collective memory. We call for the expansion of the concept of traditional ecological knowledge to include short-term and dynamic processes of knowledge generation.

AN  - 2534852209
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of transactional costs on smallholder avocado farmers’ participation in the export market and the extent of participation in Murang’a County, Kenya.Design/methodology/approachData was collected from 384 avocado farmers in Murang’a County, following stratified sampling. The Heckman two-stage model was used for analysis.FindingsResults showed that the cost of information search was an important variable that impedes smallholders’ participation in export marketing while harvesting costs inhibits the extent of participation in export marketing.Research limitations/implicationsThis study used data at the farm level. Therefore, insights on transaction costs among other marketing agents in the export market value chain would be an issue for future studies.Originality/valueFollowing the debate on transaction costs and market participation among farmers in Sub-Sahara Africa, this paper models transactional costs and export market participation among avocado smallholders and measures the extent of participation with the inclusion of harvesting costs, negotiation costs, monitoring costs and information search costs that are not common in previous studies, thus contributing to the development of literature.

T1  - Responsibilising the Fairtrade Premium: Imagining better decision-making
AN  - 2587211233
AB  - Fairtrade International (FTI) sets forth in its theory of change a food future that consists of fair trade, small farmer and farm worker empowerment and sustainable livelihoods for producers in the Global South. The enactment of this socio-technical imaginary, what we call the Fairtrade imaginary, relies upon a suite of voluntary standards as the means to organise actors and implement rules of engagement. A central component of the FTI imaginary is a social premium (the Fairtrade Premium) that consists of an extra amount of money paid by supply chain buyers to certified producer organisations (POs). On the one hand, this premium payment serves as a powerful demonstration of a responsible North-South trading system that benefits the producers. On the other hand, the premium payment is an object of conflict, as northern buyers criticize FTI and producers about a lack of transparency in the use of the Premium. We examine these tensions in the Fairtrade Imaginary in order to understand the role of decision-making in responsibilising trade practices. Empirical case studies of two banana POs, one in Ecuador and the other in Peru, show that separated decision-making processes increase levels of participation and accountability in Premium use. While organizational independence is an ideal type of responsibility in the Fairtrade imaginary, our findings suggest that the allocation of 'role-responsibility' across the system might better strengthen collective responsibility. We conclude that realising better food futures requires strengthening responsibilities for decision-making within POs, rather than pushing for more transparent accounting mechanisms between the POs and Fairtrade International.

T1  - Group contracts and sustainability: Experimental evidence from smallholder seed production
AN  - 2562504841
AB  - Contract farming in seed production has played an instrumental role in bringing private investment into seed research and production. As developing countries have predominantly small and marginal farmers, the number of inefficiencies that arise from seed contractual agreements hinders producers from realizing the full potential benefits from seed contracts. We carried out an economic experiment with real producers and organizers currently engaged in seed production to analyze their preference for group seed contracts, its sustainability and welfare implications in the seed value chain. The producers are offered two types of group contracts: B and C. Contract B involves a company-organizer-seed producer group (SPG) whereas contract C removes the organizer and directly engages with the SPG (company → SPG). In the experiment, producers are asked to choose between an existing contract and either of the proposed group contracts. The experiment consists of two treatments: (i) concealed and revealed price information between agents, and (ii) presence and absence of a local organizer while making the decision. We find that the preference for group contract B is higher than for group contract C, suggesting the need for producers bargaining which can be achieved through group contract in the existing contract, Bargaining is high (6.3 percentage points) when price information is concealed. SPGs survive for about four out of five rounds and more than half of the groups (53%) formed in the first round survived throughout the five rounds, indicating a very high group sustainability.

T1  - Choice of marketing outlets among smallholder cowpea farmers in Ghana
TT  - Choice of cowpea marketing outlets
AN  - 2553714204
AB  - PurposeTo help address the problem of imperfections in the performance of cowpea markets in Ghana, the study sought to understand the costs and benefits associated with different market outlets and factors influencing farmers' choice of these outlets.Design/methodology/approachA two-stage sampling technique was adopted to collect data from 300 cowpea farmers through purposive sampling of communities and simple random selection at the farmer level in Ejura Sekyedumasi municipality of Ghana. Analytical methods including profitability measures such as gross margin, net margin, return on investment and multinomial logistic (MNL) regression model were used to analyze the data.FindingsThe results showed that production and marketing of cowpea is profitable with farmers who trade in wholesale markets recording the highest gross margin (Gh₵1245.85 (US$227.76)), net margin (Gh₵1029.37 (US$188.18)) and return on investment (ROI) of 63%. Important nonfarm-related factors including household size, farming experience, membership of farmer-based organization and extension contact were found to significantly influence the choice of marketing outlets in the study area. In addition, market attributes such as produce selling price, volume of cowpea sold and post-harvest value addition were also key determinants of cowpea market outlet choices.Practical implicationsThe results of the study are vital to agricultural administrators in devising efficient cowpea market systems for smallholder farmers in Ghana. Likewise, the study provides important information to smallholder farmers in the choice of market outlets that maximizes their returns.Originality/valuePrevious studies on marketing of cowpea in Ghana emphasized on direct retail or consumer marketing to maximize farmers' returns. Meanwhile, there are claims to suggest that the sale of cowpea grains in the country are carried out through varied market outlets which come with differing costs and benefits implications for smallholder farmers. Therefore, the present study comprehensively compared associated costs and benefits in all available cowpea market outlets so as to settle the confusion surrounding most profitable and efficient marketing channel for smallholder farmers toward poverty reduction.

T1  - Do benefits of expanded midstream activities in crop value chains accrue to smallholder farmers? Evidence from Zambia
AN  - 2553019979
AB  - The rapid expansion of food supply chains across Africa has created huge market opportunities for farmers. In particular, the rise of numerous enterprises engaged in food processing and trading in the 'midstream' of value chains is promising. Compared to large enterprises using formal contracts, midstream enterprises not using contracts are considered more accessible to small-scale farmers. However, the extent to which economic benefits of the recent expansion of these non-contract opportunities in Africa is inclusive of smallholder farmers is uncertain and largely unexplored. This is critical for the global debate on poverty and sustainable economic development as the share of agricultural land under smallholder farmers, who constitute a significant proportion of the world's poor is still rising. This paper contributes to this thin literature with evidence from Zambia, where a growing demand for meat has stimulated growth of the soybean industry. We use nationally-representative panel survey data from Zambia to explore the welfare effects of smallholder engagement with soybean traders and processors in non-contractual arrangements. The analysis uses fixed effects and instrumental variables estimation techniques to address the endogeneity of the smallholder decision to sell to large-scale traders and processors. We find significant positive crop income effects of selling to soybean large-scale traders and processors on all smallholders. However, the observed effects only translate into higher total household incomes and poverty reduction for medium-scale smallholders (operating 5 ha- 20 ha) but not for small-scale smallholders operating less than five hectares. The positive crop income effects are mainly driven by the opportunity to sell more although small-scale smallholders receive a price premium from selling to large buyers. These results suggest that the recent expansion of the soybean industry in Zambia is benefiting smallholder farmers but not necessarily enough to move the smallest of these farmers out of poverty.

T1  - Making Research Collaborations: Learning from Processes of Transdisciplinary Engagement in Agricultural Research
AN  - 2731462253
AB  - This article is an attempt to capture the process and outcomes of disciplinary collaborations in two multi-partner transdisciplinary research projects on agriculture. The focus of the projects was building smallholder resilience in semi-arid tropics. The collaborating disciplines fall broadly into natural sciences and social sciences. The farming community and other actors across the agricultural value chain, being the end users of research, were active stakeholders. This paper details the drivers and barriers in transdisciplinary collaboration and articulates the extent of disciplinary integration achieved between the natural sciences, social sciences and the end users of research. The key elements contributing to effectiveness of transdisciplinary research are the conceptual clarity of disciplinary contributions and interfaces, shared knowledge of the expected research outcomes, positioning of the different disciplines within the research framework, openness of the researchers to disciplinary cross fertilisation, the transdisciplinary research experience of the partnering institutions and accommodation of the cultural differences between the collaborating partners.

T1  - The Impact of Contract Farming on the Welfare of Rural Farms: A Case of Heineken Brewery's Create Project In Tiyo Woreda, Ethiopia
AN  - 2637838900
AB  - Heineken brewery has introduced malt barley contract farming scheme in the country's wheat-barley excellence zones since 2014. This study examines the impact of such contract farming on food security poverty and income of farmers in Tiyo woreda of Arsi zone. This study used 150 sample households and data were collected from primary sources through questionnaire, focus group discussion and key informants interview. The study employed propensity score matching to examine the impact of contract farming on income, poverty and food security. The results of the propensity score matching revealed that the project has a significant impact on the income of participating householders as the income received from malt barley and other crops has been significantly higher than that of the non-participants respectively. But, the project failed to impact their pre-harvesting season's food security of participants; as the increased income was not transformed into improved food consumption patterns. To preeminent project impact, the government and the sponsors in relation with other related stakeholders should further promote the scheme, provide quality and adequate inputs and timely credit services, devise mechanisms to incorporate the resource poor and distantly located households, incomes obtained to reach women, and provide after marketing monitoring, training and compulsory saving for the participant farmers.

T1  - Gaps in expectations of a cotton producer: the case of Rwenzori cotton farmers in Uganda
AN  - 2548801532
AB  - The plight of the smallholder cotton farmer in the Rwenzori region of western Uganda starts with the unfair terms of hiring land for cultivation. The next hurdle is the loss of ownership of the cotton at the earliest stage of the value chain after delivering the produce to the ginner. Even the Fairtrade standards base the minimum price for the farmer on delivery of seed cotton at the ginnery, implying that the farmer is not expected to participate in the value chain and share the accruing value additions further up the chain. However, members of the Rwenzori Farmers' marketing Co-operative Society decided to move a step up the value chain by hiring the ginning services and, hence, retained the ownership of both the lint and cotton seed, which improved their income by at least 30 per cent. The strategy is to find investors to enable them to spin the cotton and manufacture the final products.

T1  - Southern sustainability initiatives in agricultural value chains: a question of enhanced inclusiveness? The case of Trustea in India
AN  - 2524567983
AB  - Recent studies have shed light on the emergence of Southern sustainability initiatives in commodity-based value chains. These initiatives position themselves as countering the exclusionary nature of many global multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs), as critically analysed by previous studies. However, a common theoretical perspective on the inclusiveness of MSIs is still lacking. By drawing on the theory of regimes of engagement, we develop a theoretical framework which helps understanding the overt and subtle practices of including or excluding different stakeholders in MSIs. We apply this framework to ‘Trustea’, an Indian MSI for sustainable tea production, to further investigate the ‘inclusiveness paradigm’ of Southern sustainability initiatives. Our findings highlight the complexity of stakeholder engagement across the different phases of Trustea’s development, from initiation and code development to formal launch and roll-out. We find that different types of engagement can exist in parallel. Justifiable engagement is expressed in the participating organisations’ reference to a shared common goal of Trustea, whereas familiar engagement is linked to the rootedness of the individuals involved in the Indian tea industry. Strategic engagement, in turn, comes to the fore through the strong emphasis on developing an Indian code for sustainable tea production and promoting adoption among tea growers. The importance of reaching this objective has led to the replication of exclusionary patterns also noted for global MSIs, as small-scale producers and other weak actors have been largely excluded from decision-making processes, despite informal efforts aimed at substitution of representation.

T1  - COCOA MARKETS AND VALUE CHAINS: IMPLICATIONS FOR SÃO TOMÉ AND PRINCIPE ORGANIC SMALLHOLDERS
AN  - 2539944868
AB  - Cocoa is one of the main goods in the world agricultural trade markets, occupying the third position in exports. The paper introduces the cocoa value chain worldwide, its asymmetries, and the supply and value chain specific to the Sao Tomé and Principe (STP) organic cocoa. It aims to understand this value chain's internal and external tensions and analyse its potential to be inserted in the international markets. The study uses panel data analysis from the FAOSTAT database. The tensions mentioned are due to the asymmetries of international markets and those regarding the production of organic cocoa in STP. At the level of STP and, despite measures to support organic production as a valuable alternative to the country's development strategy, imbalances in the value chain persist that compromise the livelihoods of small producers responsible for most of production exported and the sustainability of the ecosystem.

T1  - Resilience of global and local value chains to the Covid‐19 pandemic: Survey evidence from vegetable value chains in Senegal
AN  - 2535965125
AB  - In this paper we descriptively investigate the Covid‐19 pandemic's early impact on the fruit and vegetable supply chain in Senegal, using trade statistics and survey data collected through online questionnaires and telephone interviews with smallholder farmers, agro‐industrial companies, agricultural workers, traders, importers, and consumers. Our results point to major differences in how Covid‐19 and containment measures disrupt supply chains between the modern export‐oriented supply chain that is centered around a few large vertically integrated agro‐industrial companies, and the more traditional domestic‐oriented supply chain with a large number of smallholder farmers and informal traders—with the former being more resilient to the Covid‐19 shock. We show that both the modern and the traditional supply chain innovate to cope with the Covid‐19 containment measures. While our study is subject to some limitations, our findings bring nuance in the debate on the resilience of the food system to the pandemic, and have important policy and research implications toward international trade, social safety measures, and food and nutrition security.

T1  - Crop prices, farm incomes, and food security during the COVID‐19 pandemic in India: Phone‐based producer survey evidence from Haryana State
AN  - 2535964818
AB  - In March 2020, India declared a nationwide lockdown in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic. Such restrictions on mobility interrupted the normal functioning of agricultural value chains. For a sample of 1767 tomato and wheat producers in the state of Haryana, we study to what extent the lockdown limited access to inputs, labor, machinery, and markets to produce, harvest, and sell their crops. We quantify crop income reductions during the first months of the lockdown and analyze to what extent these are associated with borrowing and food insecurity. We find that wheat producers, for whom state‐led procurement guaranteed market access at fixed prices, suffered minimal declines in income. For tomato producers—an already more vulnerable population—income fell by 50% relative to their expected income in a normal year, largely due to a steep fall of tomato prices as they shifted from wholesale markets to local retail markets, resulting in a sharp increase in local supply. Relative to wheat producers affected by the lockdown, reduced income for tomato producers was associated with an increase in borrowing and reduced food security. We conclude that targeting producers of crops that face substantial price risk and introducing policies that stabilize market prices are important in efforts to aid recovery and build resilience of smallholder farmers.

T1  - Indigenous adaptation to climate change risks in northern Ghana
AN  - 2533056673
AB  - There is growing evidence of a range of theoretical and applied Indigenous climate change adaptation strategies, yet analyses of African examples are generally focused at single local spatial scales, with limited description of how they have evolved over time. Drawing from research across three districts in northern Ghana, this study employs a mixed-methods approach and an interpretivist framework to develop understanding of how farmers are implementing Indigenous adaptation strategies in response to climate change risks at both household and community scales. Farmers are perceiving multiple climate risks such as increased temperatures, erratic rainfall and prolonged droughts, which are disrupting cropping calendars and decreasing productivity. In response to those impacts, farming households are utilising Indigenous knowledge to individually implement diverse strategies such as rainwater harvesting, relocation of farms to water sources, neem leaf extract and organic manure applications, while communities are collectively engaging in congregational prayers, rituals for rainmaking, taboos, investment in local irrigation systems and tree planting. Farmers’ adaptation strategies are evolving over time, as many people are integrating Indigenous practices with modern knowledge and technologies to facilitate improvements in irrigation, organic manure application, planting drought-resistant crops, agroforestry and crop diversification. Decision-makers in local, regional and national government institutions could work to design multi-scalar adaptation interventions that support the integration of Indigenous and modern knowledge to address the complexity of climate change risks across different scales to promote sustainable livelihoods.

T1  - Integration maturity analysis for a small citrus producers' supply chain in a developing country
TT  - Integration maturity analysis for a supply chain
AN  - 2528085130
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this research is to determine the convenience of using a contract model as an integration mechanism for decision-making in a decentralized supply chain of small agricultural producers in a developing country, taking as hypothesis coordinated chain achieves better management. The analysis is based on information obtained by direct inquiry to 99 small producers in the region, about planning, production, marketing and distribution in the chain, supplemented with secondary information sources.Design/methodology/approachAs a methodology an analysis of maturity in the chain based on the Capability Maturity Model Integration is done, whose evaluation is later analyzed as a fuzzy logic model, with the support of the fuzzy logic of the MATLAB toolbox, to study the convenience of the use of the contract against the other mechanisms, and to establish an approximation to the level of readiness of the chain toward integration.FindingsResults obtained show that the small farmer supply chain studied, from a maturity perspective, has a strong disposition for the use of contracts as an integration mechanism.Research limitations/implicationsThe supply chain for small producers presents a high dispersion, little consolidated offer capacity and lack of coordination. Limitations in terms of information and criteria unification are a challenge for future research. Results have socioeconomic implications for small producers and can serve as a guide to formulate policies by the governments in Latin American countries.Practical implicationsAs practical implications, it can be stated that the use of supply contracts is a real mechanism that can be implemented in this type of chain, to break the mistrust between the echelons and improve the supply chain performance. This research will allow to establish support programs from local governments for the sustainability and improving income of small producers. In addition, contracts will allow to formalize the linkage of small producers to a sustainable commercial network.Social implicationsSmall agricultural producers in developing countries live in unfavorable conditions, with socioeconomic limitations. This work offers an alternative for their productive activity development that will allow them access to marketing chains in a safe way and improve their living conditions.Originality/valuePrevious studies related to the maturity toward the chain integration and fuzzy logic as a hybrid methodology, were not found in the literature, and less even applied to a chain of small agricultural products.

T1  - Participation in farmers' organization and production efficiency: empirical evidence from smallholder farmers in Bangladesh
TT  - Participation in farmers' organization
AN  - 2506658828
AB  - PurposeFarmer organizations (FOs) can elevate many of the production- and marketing-related challenges by ensuring access to technology, farming information and loan for inputs and mechanization. This study assesses the major factors that affect the participation in FOs by the smallholder rice farmers in Bangladesh and evaluates the impacts of the participation on rice yield and production efficiency.Design/methodology/approachThe present study used primary data collected from 1,000 smallholder rice farmers in northwest Bangladesh, consisting of 250 farmers those participated in an organization. This study utilized a sample selection stochastic production frontier (SPF) method, a combination of the conventional SPF and the Heckman's sample selection model, to control for biases stemming from observed and unobserved attributes.FindingsThis study demonstrates that participation in an organization is significantly affected by smallholder rice farmers' education, occupation, family size, household income, land ownership and the location where they reside. At the same time, the participation status affects the productivity of smallholder farmers. Findings indicate that farmers who participated in an organization had higher rice yield (11% more) and were technically more efficient (1.4 percentage points higher) compared to farmers who did not participate.Research limitations/implicationsSince this study was carried out with representative sampled farmers from northwest Bangladesh, the findings may not represent all farmers' perceptions of FOs in the country.Originality/valueEven though more than 200,000 FOs are currently in operation, knowledge regarding the effectiveness of Bangladesh's FOs is limited. Notably, this study used a relatively new method, sample selection SPF model, to investigate the impact of FOs on the production efficiency of smallholder rice farmers in northwest Bangladesh. Therefore, this study contributes to the literature in elucidating the factors affecting participation in FOs and its impact on rice yield and efficiency. Since FOs have been somewhat ineffective in their role as service providers in Bangladesh, this study’s results will guide policymakers to intervene more successfully regarding the changes needed.

T1  - Branding of green tea leaf: a disruptive innovation for building market competitiveness of small tea growers in North East India
TT  - Branding of green tea leaf
AN  - 2506656809
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to explore the opportunities and methods for branding fresh tea leaves, currently sold as commodities in the B2B market, as an innovative method by engaging with a smallholder group. The purpose is to enhance the market competitiveness of the significant number of small tea growers in developing economies.Design/methodology/approachAn exploratory study was conducted comprising a qualitative survey of a farmers' group formed by the smallholding of tea gardens and the sourcing factories in the state of Assam, India. Relevant case studies on the branding of agricultural commodities were also analyzed.FindingsSmallholding farmers, through collective efforts and with adequate extension and marketing support, can comply with the standards expected from their buyer. Perishable farm produce sold in the B2B market can be differentiated by exploiting attributes beyond the physical product. Market linkages established through innovative practices can enhance the market competitiveness of smallholdings.Research limitations/implicationsSuccessful branding of tea leaves can encourage similar practice in other agricultural crops as well. This will improve the quality of produce, increase the earnings of smallholdings and at the same time enhance customer value and satisfaction.Originality/valueThis paper is the first of its kind to investigate the opportunities for branding tea leaves produced by smallholdings and sold in the B2B market. The findings will be useful to researchers, smallholdings, policymakers, and consumers at large.

T1  - Bringing more value to small farmers: a study of potato farmers in Pakistan
TT  - Bringing more value to small farmers
AN  - 2528005213
AB  - PurposeSmall farmers, being the primary producers of crops, are the key players in the food supply chain. Yet, they remain the most marginalized in the value chain. The marginalization of small farmers can affect food sustainability. The purpose of this paper is to identify opportunities for bringing more value to small farmers in an agricultural value chain.Design/methodology/approachThis paper makes use of action research, studying the potato value chain, in a developing agricultural country Pakistan. The authors conducted an in-depth study of 37 farmers in four regions, each being a large potato growing ecosystem. The study examined the end-to-end decision-making processes, sources of input (both physical and information), cultivation and sales practices, cost structure, productivity and profitability of the farmers in potato farming.FindingsLarge variations exist in the crop yield, cost structure and profitability of farmers within each of and among the four regions due to differences in cultivation practices and approach to sales. There is a significant potential to lower costs, increase yield and enhance overall profitability by using the existing better processes. By addressing the issues faced by small farmers their profits can be potentially doubled. The paper also discusses potential means of recrafting and streamlining the value chain to bring more value to small farmers.Research limitations/implicationsThe paper provides a detailed account of how different interventions can increase the value for small farmers. Since the current food supply chain and sustainability are under stress, worldwide, the findings of this study have implications for farmers as well as policy makers.Originality/valueThe literature on streamlining the agricultural value chain and enhancing the share of small farmers is scarce. Improving the value chain and reducing the marginalization of small farmers is an essential step toward increasing food sustainability.

T1  - Rethinking the divide: Exploring the interdependence between global and nested local markets
AN  - 2553853148
AB  - The debate on smallholder commodification trajectories tends to be polarised between mainstream approaches that advocate tighter integration of smallholders into global value chains, and alternative approaches that favour localised markets on the grounds that these provide greater autonomy over production and marketing, and allow a greater share of value to be realised for producers and the wider community. This debate obscures the interrelations and possible synergies between them; a critique taken up in this paper. Using a case study on agricultural diversification in the former homeland of Venda, South Africa, we explore the usefulness of the nested markets concept to make sense of smallholders' patterning of markets by combining tree crops for export with seasonal vegetables for local markets. Exploring the drivers of diversification, we show how farmers' patterning of markets depends on their profiles and corresponding trajectory of accumulation. Local markets are articulated systems that function as hybrid spaces of interaction that enable farmers without any alternative off-farm income to gain and sustain access to global commodity markets. This challenges the framing of nested markets as an act of resistance as well as the dichotomy between local versus global markets as mutually exclusive. Instead, we argue that these markets can be interconnected and mutually supportive and are opportunistically used as such by petty commodity producers to sustain their export-oriented production system. If these relations are better understood, they stand to enable agrarian policy, which currently favours high-value tree crops, to be more inclusive of young and less well-resourced farmers.

T1  - Formal rules and its role in centralised-diffusion systems: A study of small-scale producers of oil palm in Colombia
AN  - 2553852888
AB  - This paper explores the different pathways of technology diffusion and the resulting impacts on technology adoption that can emerge following a strategy to incorporate vulnerable communities of small-scale producers into traditionally top-down governance agribusiness systems. Building on the Contract Farming Arrangements (CFA) literature, we suggest that despite high levels of top-down control and the mono systems of diffusion that these practices imply, diffusion forms can vary considerably according to the motivations that drive different types of producers and the variances in local governance. We summarise these diffusion forms as a diffusion pathway of governance dictated by dominant change agent control and a diffusion pathway of governance dictated by change agent control and user participation. An important contribution of the paper is to highlight the critical role of formal rules in defining the types of governance for the creation of these different pathways. However, additional factors associated with the participation of smallholders such as attachment to land, engagement in collective action and long-term sustainability visions also introduce variations in these pathways and define the results of technology adoption. The study focuses on the Colombian oil palm sector; a key agribusiness sector targeted by policy makers with a strategy to integrate small-scale farmers into the agribusiness value chain as a means to relieve poverty and reduce levels of rural violence associated with conflicts over land and production of elicit crops.

T1  - Does contract farming improve rice farmers' food security? Empirical evidence from Ghana
TT  - Rice farmers' food security
AN  - 2526827647
AB  - PurposeIn order to improve access to resources for smallholder farmers, efforts are being made to promote contract farming in Ghana. This is seen as a strategy to increase agricultural productivity of farmers, give better market access and guarantee adequate supply of raw materials to agro-based industries. However, the challenge is whether contract farming leads to improvement in food security status of farmers. The study therefore seeks to explore to what extent farmers' food security status is influenced by their participation in contract farming activities.Design/methodology/approachUsing Cragg's double-hurdle model to analyse participation in contract farming, the authors control for selection bias using propensity score matching applied to a data set of 336 observations to examine the impact of contract farming on the food security levels of rice farmers in Ghana.FindingsThe results of this study show that yield of paddy and the wealth of the farmer are the main factors that influence the quantity of paddy rice to be contracted in contract farming arrangements. This study also finds that participation in contract farming will increase food security by 109%. In conclusion, contract farming has a significant positive impact on the farmers' food security status.Originality/valueAgricultural policies and rural development initiatives supporting the promotion and expansion of contract farming should be pursued to persuade more farmers to produce under contract farming agreements.

T1  - Application of Supply Chain Requirements for Smallholders: Impact on Sustainable Palm Oil Management Policies in Indonesia
AN  - 2524933381
AB  - The pressure of the global economic climate that is leading to the concept of sustainability by emphasizing traceability and reducing environmental impact has resulted in the ISPO standard not being fully recognized internationally. This is likely to exclude smallholders from national value chains and from international markets that demand certified commodities. Therefore, this policy brief aims to use ISPO certification to maintain the smallholders’ position in the national value chain. The methods used are spatial analysis, field surveys, and in-depth interviews. The data obtained will then be analyzed with a qualitative approach through Focus Group Discussions (FGD) with experts in various fields to draw conclusions and decisions on policy improvements.

T1  - The role of access to finance for smallholders' seed business growth in Nepal
AN  - 2508721369
AB  - Finance is vital for commercialising seed businesses and the Government of Nepal has launched a priority sector-lending plan (PSLP) for financing agriculture. This article assesses the use and role of finance and the challenges in accessing PSLP loans, using interviews with 197 farmer households and stakeholders. The results show that awareness about PSLP can increase gross margins by 46%, but farmers have yet to take on PSLP loans. Bankers lack the agribusiness knowledge to support PSLP. The study recommends that policymakers and bankers harmonise policies and PSLP implementation by aligning loans with cropping cycles, farmers’ institutions, seed value chains and effective outreach.

T1  - Digital connectivity at the upstream end of value chains: A dynamic perspective on smartphone adoption amongst horticultural smallholders in Kenya
AN  - 2504702779
AB  - Driven by the rapid adoption of Internet-based technologies amongst producers in the Global South, the question of how and whether global value chain arrangements are reconfigured remains open to debate. This article addresses the changing practices of export-oriented smallholders accompanying the transition from simple phone towards smartphone use. Our dynamic approach compares cross-sectional survey data from 2013 and 2017 to answer to what extent Kenyan smallholders have adopted the Internet, which digital practices in relation to agricultural value chains they use and how this affects the inter-firm coordination between smallholders and subsequent actors. Smartphones have gained broad importance for smallholders as they are used for digital practices in value chains. Contrary to the debated dark sides of Internet connectivity, we can however not confirm sweeping digital control or value appropriation by lead firms. So far, long-established, analogue practices widely persist in arrangements between smallholders and exporters. Nevertheless, smartphones are used to nurture multilateral knowledge networks of unprecedented reach and size and further allow for incipient experiments with marketing strategies on digital marketing platforms devoted to domestic markets. We argue that these practices resemble strategic niche seeking that has to be interpreted in relation to captive export arrangements. With qualitatively and quantitatively increasing options to access and share knowledge and to market commodities, the Internet can serve to navigate the multiplicity of chain alternatives (domestic production, informal export production). Such niches should be considered as creating leverage against the take it or leave it deal of captive export production.

T1  - Bitter sugarification: sugar frontier and contract farming in Uganda
AN  - 2486409300
AB  - Contract farming schemes have recently been portrayed by global development agencies as an alternative to ‘land grabs’, promoting processes of inclusive development through the integration of smallholders within global agro-industrial production complexes. The paper takes issue with such argument, using the case-study of contract farming scheme at Kakira Sugar Works in Uganda as empirical terrain for this investigation. It argues that despite contract farming schemes at first sight appear not to generate dispossession or displacement, they lead to forms of expulsion and/or marginalization of poor smallholders from sugar agro-poles through social differentiation. It also maintains that rather than being the antithesis to land enclosures, contract farming represents one instance of global neoliberal agricultural restructuring, functional to the expansion of the sugar frontier at cheap costs. This process, which I term sugarification, involves the maximization of value extraction from farmers, its appropriation by agribusiness and finance capital, and a regime of production which devaluates labour (wage and family) and nature, while dramatically affecting existing livelihoods and landscapes.

T1  - Strategies to optimize women’s participation in palm cattle integration
AN  - 2512942016
AB  - Palm cattle integration as an integrated farming system is intrinsically complex. The model involves different processes and interactions between various actors in the value chain. The participation of women farmers in agriculture is considered the primary social capital in creating agricultural sustainability and improving productivity, but norms and socio-cultural aspects often dictate these roles. Investing in women in smallholder-based supply chains is expected to increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve broader goals. Approximately 49% of agricultural households comprise of women farmers. While both men and women contribute significantly to palm cattle integration, rural women’s roles in production activities and technology transfer are not fully documented. On the other side, women’s participation in agricultural activities is still faced with various constraints. Hence, this study’s aim is twofold: to analyze the driving factors and constraints that motivate women’s participation and formulate strategies to increase women’s participation in palm cattle integration. This study provides useful information to develop appropriate intervention policies and strategies to support, enhance, and increase women’s participation in palm cattle integration.

T1  - Impacts of interlocked contractual arrangements on dairy farmers’ welfare in Zambia: a robust Bayesian instrumental variable analysis
AN  - 2507362415
AB  - While contract farming and interlocked contractual arrangements (ICAs) are generally perceived to resolve persistent market failures and improve smallholder farmers' welfare in developing countries, uncertainties remain as to whether these arrangements enhance welfare because of farmers' low marketed volumes and margins. To account for potential selection bias, non-Gaussian and missing data problems, a robust two-stage Bayesian instrumental variable approach is used to determine the impact of dairy farmers' participation in ICAs on household income and milk revenue. Data are from smallholder dairy farmers in Zambia. We find that male household heads, wealth, experience selling to milk collection centres (MCCs), livestock holding, milking parlour ownership, landholding, and access to marketing information positively affect farmers' probability to participate in ICAs. However, increased off-farm income and distance to MCCs limit their participation. While some socioeconomic variables have significant positive effects of affecting ICA participation on household welfare, we find no sufficient evidence of causal effects of ICAs on household incomes and milk revenue among dairy farmers. Thus, while ICAs enhance smallholder farmers' access to markets, they may not address high rural poverty rates in developing countries. We provide some insights by which performance of ICAs in the dairy sector may be improved.

T1  - An empirical analysis of the use of agricultural mobile applications among smallholder farmers in Myanmar
AN  - 2495972703
AB  - Mobile phone applications (apps) designed to assist smallholder farmers improve decision‐making have been revolutionizing the agriculture sector. These apps offer solutions to farmer information needs by providing weather information, crop market trends, pest and disease damage identification, and advice on pesticide and fertilizer use. They also facilitate interaction with fellow farmers, extension workers and other stakeholders in the value chain who are interested in information exchange. Much previous research has investigated the contribution of mobile apps to agricultural production. This study explored the agricultural mobile apps available in Myanmar, analyzed factors affecting their use and assessed the potential for farm‐based decision support. Our findings indicate that when introducing mobile‐based tools, focus should be given to younger, more educated farmers growing more specialized crops. The main constraints to adopt agricultural apps are lack of access to smartphone and/or internet (63%) and lack of digital knowledge (20%). However, smallholder farmers in Myanmar were optimistic and positive toward agricultural apps for effective utilization. We also found that majority of the surveyed farmers were familiar with information received through Facebook groups. Incorporating useful information and functions from an agricultural mobile app to a Facebook Page could have a more useful and sustainable impact.

T1  - The Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture and Food Security in the Greater Horn of Africa
AN  - 2487343239
AB  - The Horn of Africa is at stake concerning climate change. The considerable population size of the Horn of Africa is a pastoral community living out of livestock and small farmers living in subsistence agricultural production. The loss of livestock and harvests resulting from a drought causes the deprivation of millions of citizens. The effect has triggered mass migration within and several offshore destinations. The question is, while Africa produces a low carbon emission, remains the primary victims of climate change. Africa lacks resources and technical expertise to respond to the devastating effects of climate change. This study aims to analyse the agency of climate change as a social and political process. Therefore, this paper seeks remedies on how to avert climate change threats by examining the collective responsibilities and different stakeholders. The article would conduct an inquiry on the responsibility of industrial nations vis-à-vis climate change. The paper employs a qualitative research method to explores how to mitigate climate change threats.

T1  - Agri-food system dynamics of small-holder hill farming communities of Uttarakhand in north-western India: socio-economic and policy considerations for sustainable development
AN  - 2486408871
AB  - The small-scale ecological farming methods of Uttarakhand hills are key to ensuring resilience to climate change as these are based on enhancing diversity, thereby increasing options to respond to climate instability. Beside eco-nutrition, local community-level economic incentives are also considered important for sustainability of traditional hill farming and food systems. Feasibility of integrating four local marketing initiatives to traditional hill farming, i) promoting community-supported organic/biodynamic agriculture (CSA), ii) linking traditional farming with school meal (MDM) programs, iii) enhanced market access and value chain development for local plant food resources, and iv) creating off-farm employment opportunity at community level for rural youths, among others, are explored in the present study. The need of re-assessing existing food and nutrition-related health and agriculture policy, and developing cross-sectoral implementation strategies on food and livelihood security, nutrition, and health was also addressed. The outcomes are expected to set priorities for state policy for a more profitable local level agriculture and regenerative food system.

T1  - Community transformation through certified organic cotton initiatives—an analysis of case studies in Peru, Tanzania and India
AN  - 2575745684
AB  - This paper examines how certified organic cotton initiatives (COCIs) influence community capitals in rural Peru, Tanzania and India using the community capitals framework (CCF). Case study analyses, including qualitative interviews of farmers, expert interviews and participatory observations, were conducted in Northern Peru, Northern Tanzania and Eastern India. The results show slight changes in community capitals in Peru, while comprehensive changes and spiraling-up effects were triggered by certified organic cotton farming initiatives in Tanzania and India. These community developments strongly depended on set measures, such as the extent of (1) partnership (e.g., contract farming), (2) input support (e.g., seeds, loans, community infrastructure), (3) capacity building (through training and advisory services), (4) group formation and (5) formation of cooperatives. Favorable environmental conditions and supporting local institutions facilitated spiraling-up effects, while social preconditions (e.g., gender inequality) strongly limited these effects. The research showed that COCIs have considerable potential to trigger spiraling-up effects in rural communities. However, the capacity strongly depends on the respective initiative and its ability to involve and empower farmers, i.e., to build up human and social capital.

T1  - Tenure reform for better forestry: An unfinished policy agenda
AN  - 2488031504
AB  - The global community is currently grappling with multiple and overlapping social and environmental threats. These include the climate emergency, COVID-19 and the threat of widespread hunger, and the accelerating loss of biodiversity. All of these threats point to an urgent need to restore and sustainably manage land and forests. Studies are pointing to the critical role of tenure reform, and in particular strengthening collective forest tenure, as an effective means to reduce deforestation, mitigate climate change, restore ecosystem services and maintain biodiversity. Since the 1970s, countries worldwide have attempted to better recognize the customary rights of local communities. Yet despite over 40 years of effort, collective forest tenure reforms have yielded only moderate results. This article draws on recent assessments conducted in 23 countries by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) on community-based forestry and associated forest tenure regimes based on the internationally endorsed Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure (the VGGT). The findings suggest that governments are increasingly giving legal recognition to community rights to use both timber and non-timber forest products for commercial purposes. Yet, the tenure provided to collective forestry is less robust than that held by companies and smallholders in a number of ways. These include fewer legal protections, more barriers to the use of these rights, inadequate access to justice, and less administrative support in documenting rights. Furthermore, in many cases the existing community forestry legal provisions are not implemented. The relatively successful cases suggest that with robust tenure, communities and smallholders can be potent vehicles for moving towards sustainable forest management and mitigating climate change, improving local livelihoods, contributing to timber and non-timber product economies, and achieving several of the Sustainable Development Goals. But for this, governments will need to strengthen community and local rights within their legal frameworks and mainstream implementation in government policies and practices. Non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations, donors, research institutions and academia can provide important support through policy implementation, research, and ensuring inclusive policy formulation processes.

T1  - ‘Smarter food’ needed to end global hunger by 2030
AN  - 2705387594
AB  - Not only can agricultural science and research help bolster the nutritional value of staple crops, but it can also produce hardier varieties that can withstand pests and disease, meaning more produce surviving to harvest and providing additional income as a buffer.

Since 2013, quality potato seed, improved crop management and value chain approaches have helped more than two million smallholder farmers in Africa and Asia.

[...]making the right crops available for changing climates and cultural environments, and improving the availability of resilient, adapted varieties relies on protecting a back catalogue of genetic material to safeguard different features of different crops.

The economic benefits of conservation are clear: gene banks like CIP’s contributed almost three-quarters of the $1 billion generated by the Victoria potato variety alone in Uganda between 1991 and 2016, which is just one indication of the potential economic value of conservation and utilisation of genetic materials.

T1  - Participation of Marginalized Households in Shrimp Value Chains in Southern Coastal Bangladesh
AN  - 2761233139
AB  - The shrimp export industry contributes significantly to Bangladesh's economy, and is having a positive impact on the livelihoods of many. However, in contrast to small-holder farmers, the role of the shrimp industry in reducing poverty among the most marginalized households, who lack land or access to other resources, has been disappointing. In order to better understand why, the present study was designed to determine the roles of marginalized households in the shrimp value chains of coastal Bangladesh. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through field surveys, focus groups and in-depth interviews in the Khulna, Bagerhat and Satkhira districts. We find that about 46% of marginalized households are engaged in shrimp value chains and added some value in each node for an average of seven months a year. Their roles were wild shrimp fry catching and trading, shrimp PL (postlarvae) collection and trading, PL numerating, PL growing-out, shrimp trading, deheading, cleaning, icing and preserving. As laborers, the role of marginalized household members in the governance structure of the value chain was insignificant, and they have limited bargaining power. Nevertheless, they contribution added value at each node of the value chain, and their labor contribution was indispensable to the functioning of the chains.

T1  - Youth’s participation in agriculture: A fallacy or achievable possibility? Evidence from rural South Africa
AN  - 2748480006
AB  - Background: The realisation of more youth involvement in the agricultural sector has proved to be elusive, so the question of the possibility of a youth-led agriculture needs further investigation.
Aim: The aim of the study was to assess whether there is potential for the rural youth to participate in agriculture by employing the typology formulation approach.
Setting: The study is premised on recent calls for strategies to reduce youth unemployment in sub-Saharan Africa by involving and enhancing the agricultural sector.
Method: A survey in questionnaire form was conducted with 224 youths from two districts in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The Principal Components Analysis and  K  -Means Clustering were performed to determine the youth typologies and assess their potential.
Results: Five typologies were identified. Most youths (59.3%) were found in Typology 1 (those that see no benefits in farming) and in Typology 2 (older, experienced and with access to land). Typology 5 (male youths in agricultural cooperatives) had the lowest proportion of youths (5.7%). Participants in typologies 2, 3 and 5 were deemed to have high to moderate potential for successful engagement in farming. The highest potential was found in the typology with the least percentage of youths.
Conclusions: The typologies showed that youths have varying perceptions and aspirations regarding agriculture. While some show an interest and have the potential to participate in farming, others do not. Therefore, the blanket notion of the youth’s lack of interest in agriculture should be qualified as it does not always hold. The heterogeneity in characteristics among the youths in these typologies, including their potential to participate in agriculture, expresses the differences in the kinds of support needed to increase their participation.

T1  - Linking Agrarian Reform Beneficiary Organizations to Agriculture Value Chain: Lessons from Farmer Organizations in Selected Regions of the Philippines
AN  - 2621174896
AB  - This paper evaluates the capacities of agrarian reform beneficiary organizations (ARBOs) to participate in value chains using data from three pilot areas in Mindanao of the Project Convergence on Value Chain Enhancement for Rural Growth and Empowerment project of the Department of Agrarian Reform. The study found low levels of organizational maturity and weak alliances among farmer organizations in the country. Thus, small farmers' participation in higher value chains has been limited, with only members of matured organizations benefiting from value chain initiatives. To capacitate farmer organizations, the study recommends that the government pool its resources and efforts and develop strategic capacity-building interventions. Achieving organizational maturity requires farmer members to commit to their ARBO through equity participation. Alternative ownership rights structure may also be considered to encourage members-both commercial and subsistence farmers-to participate and invest in cooperatives. Another strategy is to enable farmer organizations to establish enterprises that will generate income for their members. Lastly, it is also important for organizations to strengthen social relations through regular meetings, collective activities, and patronage incentives to build trust among members.

T1  - Les standards dits durables appauvrissent-ils les planteurs de cacao ? Interactions entre déforestation en Côte d’Ivoire et au Libéria, crédit à l’achat d’engrais et baisse des cours
AN  - 2615617205
AB  - Pendant des siècles, combinés avec le travail de migrants, la forêt et la rente forêt ont été les principaux facteurs de production du cacao. C’est le modèle universel du cacao, qui a fait de la Côte d’Ivoire le premier producteur mondial. Mais le niveau de déforestation est tel qu’une partie des planteurs doivent trouver des alternatives à la rente forêt, notamment l’engrais minéral. Cet intrant chimique est de fait un facteur d’amélioration des rendements et a priori des revenus. Cependant, si la consommation d’engrais chimique est poussée par le « système », composé des Transnational Corporations (TNC) du cacao, des coopératives, des agences de crédit, des organisations non gouvernementales internationales et des labels de cacao dit « durables », n’y a-t-il pas danger d’effets inverses : contribution à l’excès d’offre de cacao, baisse du cours mondial, endettement et appauvrissement des planteurs ? À partir de trois enquêtes auprès de 150 à 250 planteurs entre 2013 et 2017, d’une enquête auprès de 41 coopératives en 2017 et d’un suivi des prix du cacao et de l’engrais sur 30 ans, l’étude aborde le rôle du prix relatif cacao/engrais et du crédit sur la consommation d’engrais, et leur impact sur la chute du cours du cacao en 2016–2017. L’impact est certain, même si le processus d’expansion cacaoyère par le binôme migration-déforestation reste le facteur essentiel de la hausse de l’offre et de la chute du cours. Le discours selon lequel les gains de rendement vont créer un « cacao durable » et dissuader les planteurs de défricher les forêts reste un mythe. Les migrations continuent aux dépens des toutes dernières forêts classées du pays, à l’est vers Abengourou, à l’ouest vers Blolequin, Man et Touba. Là encore, en dépit de leur communication sur la durabilité, les certifications ont totalement échoué : le cacao de Côte d’Ivoire dépend encore beaucoup de la déforestation. Enfin, de l’autre côté du fleuve Cavally, la grande forêt dense du Libéria disparaît à son tour, sur la voie d’un nouveau boom du cacao. Même si les responsabilités sont partagées avec les politiques publiques, que reste-t-il de « durable » dans la certification et les actions de la majorité des TNC ? Le fossé entre leur communication virtuelle et la réalité n’a jamais été aussi grand.Alternate abstract:
For centuries, combined with the work of migrants, forests and forest rent have been the main factors of production of cocoa. This is the universal cocoa model, which has made Côte d’Ivoire the world’s leading producer. However, the level of deforestation is such that some of the cocoa smallholders must find alternatives to the forest rent, including mineral fertilizer, potentially a factor in improving yields and, a priori, their income. However, in case the “system” – made up of cocoa Transnational Corporations (TNCs), cooperatives, credit agencies, international non-governmental organizations and so-called “sustainable” cocoa labels – drives up the consumption of chemical fertilizers, will there not be a danger of the opposite effect taking place: contribution to the excess supply of cocoa, drop in world prices, and indebtedness and impoverishment of the smallholders? Based on three surveys of 150 to 250 growers between 2013 and 2017, a survey of 41 cooperatives in 2017, and the monitoring of cocoa and fertilizer prices over 30 years, this study addresses the role of the cocoa/fertilizer relative price and credit on fertilizer consumption and their impact on the drop in cocoa prices in 2016–2017. The impact is undeniable, even though the process of cocoa expansion through migration and deforestation remains the essential factor behind the increase in supply and the fall in price. The argument that yield gains will create “sustainable cocoa” and deter smallholders from clearing forests remains an illusion. Migration continues at the expense of the country’s very last classified forests, east to Abengourou, west to Blolequin, Man and Touba. Again, despite their communication on sustainability and environment-friendly practices, certifications have totally failed. Cocoa in Côte d’Ivoire still depends heavily on deforestation. Finally, on the other side of the Cavally River, Liberia’s large dense forest is disappearing in turn, on the way to a new cocoa boom. Even if public policies are partly responsible, what is left of “sustainability” in the certification and actions of the majority of TNCs? The gap between their virtual communication and reality has never been greater.

T1  - Factors affecting the intensity of market participation of smallholder sheep producers in northern Ethiopia: Poisson regression approach
AN  - 2614940072
AB  - Sheep marketing is playing a great role in improving the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. Although it plays a great role, the smallholder farmers are not sufficiently participating in the sheep market so they are poor. Therefore, this study was designed to analyze the factors affecting the intensity of sheep market participation in Northern Ethiopia. The data were collected from 289 randomly selected sample households. Descriptive statistics and Poisson regression was used to analyze the identified data. The descriptive statistics revealed that the number of sheep market participants were 148 (51.21%), but the average number of sheep sold in the market was three. The Poisson regression model showed that the age of household head, education of household head, number of sheep owned, selling price of sheep, market access, distance to the nearest market, availability of grazing land, and availability of feed appeared to be significant in determining the intensity of sheep market participation significantly. The study suggested that improving the market infrastructure (market information, road construction, selling price), educational level (by providing frequent extension service/training about sheep marketing) and productivity of grazing land could enhance the intensity of sheep market participation.

T1  - Effect of market information quality, sharing and utilisation on the innovation behaviour of smallholder pig producers
AN  - 2614939943
AB  - Although pig farming can accelerate Uganda’s economic development, the value chain is undeveloped with poorly organized informal markets. Buyers take advantage of farmers paying low prices, pointing to the poor quality of pigs and pork. Farmer innovation can remedy this situation by enabling farmers to reduce costs, improve pig productivity and quality of pigs and pork. Leveraging farmer innovation behaviour calls for appropriate agricultural information. However, the effect of market information quality, sharing, and utilization on the innovation behaviour of pig producing farmers is not fully known. This study sought to determine the effect of information quality, sharing, and utilisation on the innovation behaviour of pig producing farmers in Northern Uganda. A cross-section survey of 239 respondents selected through multiple stages of purposive and random sampling was done. Data were analysed by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results show that information quality contributes significantly to innovation behaviour directly (β = 0.247; P < 0.01) as well as indirectly through the partial mediation of information utilization (β = 0.176; 95% CI = 0.040∼0.349). Therefore, interventions that seek to enhance smallholder farmer innovation should provide quality information and support farmers to utilise it.

T1  - Synergies and trade-offs of selected climate smart agriculture practices in Irish potato farming, Kenya
AN  - 2614935093
AB  - Research on and disseminating Climate Smart Agricultural (CSA) practices has led to increased awareness and farmers’ capacity to develop resilient agricultural production systems for sustainable livelihoods and food security while addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation. Thus, there is a potential in gaining valuable insight into how Irish potato smallholder farmers should respond to current and future climate risks. However, studies exploring and linking expert opinion on synergies and trade-offs in adapting the CSA practices are limited. This study integrated qualitative and quantitative data from 22 expert surveys and semi-structured questionnaires to answer the following objectives: 1) Which top five CSA practices are currently used by Irish potato farmers and which ones are preferred by experts in response to climate change adaptation in Kenya? 2) How do the selected CSA practices perform in Irish potato farming in Kenya? 3) Which synergies and trade-offs occur upon implementation of these CSA practices? The study found that CSA practices most preferred by both experts and farmers are improved crop varieties, efficient use of agrochemicals, early land preparation, diversified crop production, efficient use of inorganic fertilizer, irrigation and changing planting dates. These selected CSA practices indicated the productivity pillar to be the best performing CSA pillar synergistically while trade-offs to occur across CSA pillars. These findings can inform different potato value chain stakeholders on the synergies and trade-off dynamics associated with adopting CSA practices for climate change adaptation. In conclusion, while CSA practices are perceived as essential, most preferred CSA practices are focused on increased production and adaptation, while mitigation goals receive less attention. The findings of this study provide an important basis for recommendation to farmers and policymakers. This study calls for sustainable and innovative ways that help to upscale the selected CSA practices in Irish potato farming in Kenya and beyond.

T1  - Determinants of adopting improved bread wheat varieties in Arsi Highland, Oromia Region, Ethiopia: A Double-Hurdle Approach
AN  - 2613412519
AB  - The improvement of agricultural productivity using technology is an important avenue for increasing output and reducing poverty in sub-Saharan countries. However, the low adoption of high yield varieties has been identified as one of the main reasons for low productivity in sub-Saharan Africa. Consequently, the study examined the effect of demographic, socioeconomic and institutional factors affecting adoption and adoption-intensity of improved wheat varieties (IWVs), using data obtained from randomly selected farm households in the Arsi Highland of Ethiopia. We estimated a Double hurdle model to analyze the determinants of the intensity of IWVs adoption, as adoption and use intensity were two independent decisions influenced by different factors. The results also show that Double hurdle model is more appropriate than the Tobit model. Empirical estimates of the first hurdle reveal that wheat farming experience, distance to cooperatives, renting a tractor and combine harvester, Urea application, and net income from the wheat grain sale all significantly increased the likelihood of IWVs adoption. Estimates of the second hurdle revealed that the decision to use the optimal intensity of IWVs by smallholder farmers was influenced by seed availability, row planting, and distance to cooperative all significantly and positively. The intensity of adoption was also found to be negatively related to the proportion of farmland allotted for wheat production. Accordingly, policies and interventions that are informed about such factors are required to accelerate the adoption and adoption-intensity of IWVs in Ethiopia to realize a wheat Green Revolution and fight food insecurity in a sustainable manner.

T1  - The impacts of community-based water development projects on rural poverty among small-holder farmers: Evidence from the Ewaso Ng’iro North Catchment Area, Kenya
AN  - 2613412449
AB  - The main challenge with respect to water in the rural setting, lies in access, control and management. Collective action has been taken up following the International Water Management (IWM) principles and institutionalized in the Kenyan legal framework through water resource users’ associations (WRUAs). We carried out this study to assess whether this collective action has any impact on household poverty using objective poverty measures (consumption and income), a subjective poverty measure and a water poverty measure. We used 2019 household survey data of 652 randomly selected rural households from the Upper Ewaso Ng’iro North Catchment Area. We employed the full information maximum likelihood endogenous probit regression model to obtain the impact of WRUA membership on household poverty status. We find that collective water management can have welfare improving impacts for rural households, especially where there low public investments in water provision, management and access. We recommend that WRUAs be empowered through financial, legal and capacity building interventions to enhance their community impacts.

T1  - Sustaining Biomaterials in Bioeconomy: Roles of Education and Learning in Mekong River Basin
AN  - 2612786823
AB  - The demands to improve the livelihood of small farmers require a systemic shift from fossil fuel-based and destructive approaches to sustainable renewable raw materials and non-destructive approaches. This should be accompanied by a fundamental reorganization of education and learning policies to create new bio-oriented value chains for biomaterials, food, wood, and energy, as well as in large parts of the health, manufacturing, and service industries. In the long run, the successful implementation of bio-oriented production depends on the systemic linking of both first- and second-hand learning in communities in rural as well as urban settings. The purpose of this paper is to present a concept for the co-design of a new curriculum to better equip new graduates with the ability to support the effort of the sustainable production of biomaterials that are non-destructive to the environment. To sustain biomaterials and enhance non-destructive ways of thinking, learning needs a community of practice in both online and onsite platforms—allowing students to better understand and support cascade use. Therefore, the use of by-products and recycling products after use will increase in importance. A community of practice, and institutions, must create education and learning platforms for improved actions regarding biomaterials across generations and experiences, which will subsequently be integrated into the circular value chains of the bioeconomy. The first- and second-hand learning to sustain these value chains depends on higher education and learning institutions with both legal mandates and systems approaches.

T1  - Constraints to Cultivation of Medicinal Plants by Smallholder Farmers in South Africa
AN  - 2612767212
AB  - Growing demand for therapeutic products from indigenous medicinal plants has led to increased interest in its cultivation, which presents a viable option for improving smallholder farmers’ livelihoods, as well as sustaining the availability of these resources for future generations. Serious bottlenecks however exist for subsistent farmers in the cultivation of these valuable plants. It was pertinent to probe whether the cultivation of medicinal plants provides feasible solutions to rural poverty, while effectively conserving threatened indigenous biodiversity. The paper employed a comprehensive review of existing literature to explore issues constraining smallholder farmers from involvement in a potentially lucrative plant value chain. Findings indicate challenges such as inadequate domestication of valuable plants species, continued over-harvesting from wild populations, poor knowledge of required agronomic practices, low efficacy perception regarding derivatives from cultivated plants, among others. These constraints occur alongside the conservation-oriented strategy driven by international conservation agencies and wholly adopted by the South African government. Recommendations to improve smallholder involvement in the cultivation of medicinal plants include support to research and extension, targeted inducement to smallholders, contracting and off-take agreements, aimed at promoting an alternative poverty-alleviation-focused economic development strategy. The review adds to the conceptual discourse related to plant diversity, resource conservation, poverty alleviation, and economic development

T1  - Recent Innovations in Post-Harvest Preservation and Protection of Agricultural Products
AN  - 2612718666
AB  - Undergraduate and graduate students from these institutions are conducting innovative research that improves drying, handling, storage, and distribution, develops monitoring and tracking technology, extends shelf-life and minimizes spoilage, and changes behavior and practices to reduce post-harvest loss and food waste from field to fork.

Educating smallholder farmers on the benefits of hermetic storage bags, and promoting adoption of this innovative chemical-free protection technology, should continue to be a priority among supply chain actors to ensure food-safe maize from producers to consumers [1]–Consortium; (2).

Utilization of such low-capacity mobile dryers to provide drying services was found to be economically viable based on net present value analysis resulting in internal rates of return (IRR) above 70%, pay-back periods (PBP) of less than two years, and positive benefit-cost ratios (BCR) greater than 2.5.

Evaluate the effects of five harvest and post-harvest technologies (harvesting tools, cold stores, plastic crates, fruit fly traps, ground tarps) promoted by the Rockefeller Foundation Yieldwise Initiative (YWI) on post-harvest loss (PHL) incurred at three stages of the mango value chain (harvest, transportation, point of sale) in Kenya.

T1  - Cereal-Legume Value Chain Analysis: A Case of Smallholder Production in Selected Areas of Malawi
AN  - 2612716790
AB  - This article analyses the cereal-legume value chain in Malawi through a comprehensive VC Map, a SWOT exercise and a policy analysis. VC participation entails a number of challenges for smallholders. Limited access to land, technology and inputs, inadequate knowledge of market functioning, insufficient access to credit and extension services, combined with more general problems of poor infrastructures, often prevent smallholder farmers from accessing profitable market opportunities. The effectiveness of national policies (e.g., public extension service support, inputs subsidy system) oriented to increase smallholders’ market access is often constrained by inadequate financial capacity, an inefficient public extension services system and limited involvement of privates in the extension services scheme. VC interventions should distinguish between VC-ready farmers, namely those provided with the minimum conditions of external and internal factors, and non-value-chain-ready farmers. Market-based interventions (e.g., enhancing VC coordination) are needed for enhancing market access of value-chain-ready farmers. Conversely, while non-market-based interventions (e.g., investments in basic infrastructure, increasing extension services, credit and inputs access) prove necessary to build the minimum asset thresholds for non-value-chain-ready farmers’ participation in the market. A smallholder-friendly VC development relies on the role played by VC actors and the need to harmonise and improve existing policies to remove inadequacies, conflicts and overlaps in the various institutions charged with implementation.

T1  - Integrating the soybean-maize-chicken value chains to attain nutritious diets in Tanzania
AN  - 2611296835
AB  - In Tanzania, diets are dominated by starchy staple crops such as maize, levels of malnutrition are high and largely attributed to lack of dietary diversity. We employed fuzzy cognitive mapping to understand the current soybean, maize and chicken value chains, to highlight stakeholder relationships and to identify entry points for value chain integration to support nutritious diets in Tanzania. The fuzzy cognitive maps were constructed based on information gathered during household interviews with 569 farming households, followed by a participatory workshop with 54 stakeholders involved in the three value chains. We found that the soybean, maize and chicken value chains were interconnected, particularly at the level of the smallholder farming systems and at processing facilities. Smallholder farming households were part of one or more value chains. Chicken feed is an important entry point for integrating the three value chains, as maize and soybean meal are the main sources of energy and protein for chicken. Unlike maize, the utilization of soybean in chicken feed is limited, mainly due to inadequate quality of processing of soybean grain into meal. As a result, the soybean grain produced by smallholders is mainly exported to neighbouring countries for further processing, and soybean meal is imported at relatively high prices. Enhancing local sourcing and adequate processing of soybean, coupled with strengthening the integration of smallholder farmers with other soybean, maize and chicken value chain actors offers an important opportunity to improve access to nutritious diets for local people. Our method revealed the importance of interlinkages that integrate the value chains into a network within domestic markets.

T1  - Sustainable Agrifood Value Chain—Transformation in Developing Countries
AN  - 2602264409
AB  - To service high-value international markets, many agrifood value chains in developing countries are required to transform to meet the strict quality and safety standards. This transformation process has become further complicated by increased sustainability expectations. The key players in these countries, typically smallholders, are struggling to meet this new sustainability value focus. Economic drivers pervade in this context, whilst the lack of integration often decouples producers from the end market. To address these challenges, this paper develops a framework to enable sustainable agrifood value chain transformation in developing countries. A narrative review was used to analyse the major enablers and barriers in sustainable agrifood value chain transformation specifically in developing countries. The framework novelty lies in the synthesis and prioritisation of transformations actions, by integrating three central dimensions: sustainability, governance, and value addition. The incorporation of sustainability drivers into value chain governance provides a holistic approach that balances profit maximization with social and environmental impacts, thus enabling smallholders in developing countries to access higher value markets. The framework can assist these value chain actors in identifying their transformation trajectory and guide policymakers, along with the public sector, in prioritising their intervention to overcome barriers.

T1  - Value Chain Analysis of <i>Eucalyptus</i> Wood Products in the Blue Nile Highlands of Northwestern Ethiopia
AN  - 2602237627
AB  - Eucalyptus wood products contribute significantly to the income of smallholder growers in many parts of Ethiopia. This has incentivized smallholders to convert arable lands to Eucalyptus plantation. Given the limited attention and availability of empirical evidence, this study examined the Eucalyptus wood products value chain in terms of the actors engaged, the type and importance of channels, margins analysis and the overall value chain governance in the main Eucalyptus growing areas of the Blue Nile highlands of Northwestern Ethiopia in 2019/2020. Sources of data were randomly selected 388 Eucalyptus grower households and 166 Eucalyptus wood traders, complemented by an interview with key informants, group discussions and direct observations. The results reveal that a total of 2,051,114.75 m3 of Eucalyptus wood was produced in the study area and Eucalyptus plantations are expanding over crop lands at a rate of 102.35 ha a year on average. Many actors involved handle a large volume of wood in eight main channels with a high disparity in the shares of the margins. We found that Eucalyptus is the main source of cash earning, contributing about 45.76% to the total annual income of smallholder growers. Little policy attention, a lack of sectoral integration, missing infrastructure and an absence of modern wood processing factories are among the key challenges impeding the performance of the wood sector value chain. There are however existing opportunities for the development of the wood sector value chain such as favorable growing conditions and the spectacular growing demand for wood products. The study provides valuable insights about the wood sector value chain and actions towards ensuring sustainable value chains and the commercialization of the sector.

T1  - Effective Mainstreaming of Agricultural Emissions into Climate Action Agenda: The Case of Institutions and Smallholder Dairy Production Systems, Western Kenya
AN  - 2601998511
AB  - Small-scale farming production systems are integral drivers of global sustainability challenges and the climate crisis as well as a solution space for the transition to climate compatible development. However, mainstreaming agricultural emissions into a climate action agenda through integrative approaches, such as Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA), largely reinforces adaptation–mitigation dualism and pays inadequate attention to institutions’ linkage on the generation of externalities, such as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. This may undermine the effectiveness of local–global climate risk management initiatives. Literature data and a survey of small-scale farmers’ dairy feeding strategies were used in the simulation of GHG emissions. The effect of price risks on ecoefficiencies or the amount of GHG emissions per unit of produced milk is framed as a proxy for institutional feedbacks on GHG emissions and effect at scale. This case study on small-scale dairy farmers in western Kenya illustrates the effect of local-level and sectoral-level institutional constraints, such as market risks on decision making, on GHG emissions and the effectiveness of climate action. The findings suggest that price risks are significant in incentivising the adoption of CSA technologies. Since institutional interactions influence the choice of individual farmer management actions in adaptation planning, they significantly contribute to GHG spillover at scale. This can be visualised in terms of the nexus between low or non-existent dairy feeding strategies, low herd productivity, and net higher methane emissions per unit of produced milk in a dairy value chain. The use of the Sustainable Food Value Chain (SFVC) analytical lens could mediate the identification of binding constraints, foster organisational and policy coherence, as well as broker the effective mainstreaming of agricultural emissions into local–global climate change risk management initiatives. Market risks thus provide a systematic and holistic lens for assessing alternative carbon transitions, climate financing, adaptation–mitigation dualism, and the related risk of maladaptation, all of which are integral in the planning and implementation of effective climate action initiatives.

T1  - Challenges and Opportunities in Applying Genomic Selection to Ruminants Owned by Smallholder Farmers
AN  - 2601973412
AB  - Genomic selection has transformed animal and plant breeding in advanced economies globally, resulting in economic, social and environmental benefits worth billions of dollars annually. Although genomic selection offers great potential in low- to middle-income countries because detailed pedigrees are not required to estimate breeding values with useful accuracy, the difficulty of effective phenotype recording, complex funding arrangements for a limited number of essential reference populations in only a handful of countries, questions around the sustainability of those livestock-resource populations, lack of on-farm, laboratory and computing infrastructure and lack of human capacity remain barriers to implementation. This paper examines those challenges and explores opportunities to mitigate or reduce the problems, with the aim of enabling smallholder livestock-keepers and their associated value chains in low- to middle-income countries to also benefit directly from genomic selection.

T1  - Government Policy and Performance of Agricultural Cooperatives: A Case Study in Chitwan District, Nepal
AN  - 2596060101
AB  - Agricultural cooperatives are producer-owned and controlled organizations to improve farmers’ livelihoods by correcting market failure. They support collective activities where individual incentives are insufficient to produce public goods. The government of Nepal has been investing economic resources in this sector, prioritizing cooperatives as part of a strategy for poverty reduction. This study examines poor farmers’ access to agricultural cooperatives and the impact of membership on farm and total household income, based on a household survey of 572 households and key informant interviews of 37 cooperative managers. The ethnicity of the family and the neighborhood, smallholder land size, distance to an agricultural cooperative, distance to the nearest local market, and distance to a motorable road are key determinants that influence cooperative membership. The analysis of the effects of cooperative membership is based on propensity score matching, controlling for a large array of household and community characteristics. The estimates imply that cooperative membership may significantly affect family net crop income, but the overall effects on total family income are modest. Agricultural cooperatives appear to be focused on financial services such as savings and credit activities but are less concerned with agricultural production, and cooperatives engage in almost no marketing activities.

TT  - Agricultural characterization of small farmers related to application of good agricultural practices in the municipality of Argelia, Valle del Cauca, Colombia
AN  - 2586616599
AB  - El siguiente artículo presenta una caracterización de agricultores de frutas y hortalizas del municipio de Argelia (Valle del Cauca, Colombia) y traza el insumo base para los requerimientos funcionales del diseño de una herramienta digital orientada al registro de las labores agrícolas aplicando buenas prácticas agrícolas (BPA). Se llevó a cabo una investigación de tipo cualitativa soportada con datos cuantitativos que consistió en entrevistar a asesores (Farm Assure) formados bajo la norma internacional GLOBALG.A.P.; además de realizar encuestas semiestructuradas a agricultores de la región y de revisar la reglamentación de dicha norma, que servirá para elaborar los requerimientos funcionales mencionados y que se implementarán en la herramienta digital. El estudio arrojó que todos los agricultores encuestados tienen algún tipo de conocimiento relacionado con la certificación de BPA, ellos reconocen que han aplicado las BPA para poder comercializar sus productos  de acuerdo con las exigencias de las cooperativas de la región.  Así mismo, se muestra la pertinencia del uso de una herramienta móvil capaz de alojar un registro de las actividades de campo, facilitando así  el proceso de certificación en BPA. La adopción de herramientas tecnológicas en la agricultura permite avanzar a la inocuidad de los productos alimentarios en Colombia.
Metodológicamente se llevó a cabo una investigación del tipo cualitativa soportada con datos cuantitativos y en este marco se realizó un trabajo de campo que consistió en: (I) entrevistas a 4 asesores (farm Assure) formados bajo la norma internacional GLOBALG.A.P.; (II) encuestas semiestructuradas realizadas a 30 agricultores de las regiones de Argelia  del Valle del Cauca; y (III) revisión de la reglamentación de la norma GlobalG.A.P., con lo cual se elaboraron los requerimientos funcionales y algunas validaciones que se  implementaran en la herramienta digital.
Los resultados cualitativos y cuantitativos de esta investigación muestran que los agricultores encuestados tienen algún tipo de conocimiento en certificación de BPA, y que lo aplican en cierta medida, dado que pertenecen a cooperativas de la región que les exigen cumplirlas para comercializar algunos productos. Además, se evidencia la pertinencia del uso de una herramienta móvil que les permita llevar un registro diario de sus labores de campo, con miras a facilitar el proceso de certificación en BPA.
Este trabajo hace un aporte al esfuerzo que se está realizando en Colombia en cuanto a la inocuidad de los productos alimentarios con miras a evitar adversidades que pongan en riesgo la salud de la población Alternate abstract: This article presents a characterization of fruit and vegetable farmers in Argelia (Valle del Cauca, Colombia) and outlines the basic input for the design functional requirements of a digital tool aimed to register agricultural work, applying Good Agricultural Practices (GAP). Was carried out a qualitative research, supported by quantitative data, it consisted of interviews to advisors (Farm Assure) trained under the international standard GLOBALG.A.P., semi-structured surveys to farmers in the region and regulations review of mentioned standard, the research output will serve to develop the aforementioned functional requirements and will be implemented in the digital tool. The study showed that all the surveyed farmers have some kind of knowledge related to GAP certification, they acknowledge that have applied GAP to be able to market their products in accordance with requirements of cooperatives in the region. Likewise, the pertinence of using a mobile tool capable of hosting a record of field activities is shown, thus facilitating the GAP certification process. The adoption of technological tools in agriculture allows progress in the safety of food products in Colombia. Methodologically, a qualitative research supported by quantitative data was carried out and in this framework a field work was done consisting of: (I) interviews with 4 farm assurers specialized under the international standard GLOBALG.A.P.; (II) semi-structured surveys to 30 farmers in Argelia region of Valle del Cauca; and (III) review of the regulations of the GlobalG.A.P. standard, with which were developed functional requirements and some validations implemented in the digital tool. The qualitative and quantitative results of this research show that the surveyed farmers have some type of knowledge in GAP certification, and that they apply it to a certain extent, given that they belong to cooperatives in the region that require them to comply with it to sell some products. In addition, it is evident the relevance of a mobile tool use that allows them to keep a daily record of their field work, in order to facilitate the GPA certification process. This work contributes to the effort that is being made in Colombia regarding the safety of food products with a view to avoid adversities that put the population's health at risk

T1  - Food security effects of smallholders’ participation in apple and mango value chains in north-western Ethiopia
AN  - 2583141715
AB  - Background 
While it has identified that linking smallholders in the agri-food value chain remains to be a promising strategy to get out of the poverty trap in many developing countries, less is known about the food security implications of smallholders’ participation in the fruits value chain. This paper examines the effects of apple and mango smallholder farmers’ participation along the value chain, focusing on their household food security in north-western Ethiopia.
 Methods 
Primary data for the study were obtained from a random sample of 384 households, 211 of which are fruit value chain participants, and the remainder are non-participants. The study used the propensity score matching (PSM) method to establish a causal relationship between the participation of the fruit value chain and changes in household food security.
 Results and conclusions 
Results indicate that participation in the apple and mango value chain has a robust and positive effect on the food security of smallholders as measured by household food consumption in kilocalorie. The unconfoundedness and overlapping assumptions were fulfilled by applying the nearest neighbor and kernel-based matching algorithms. The study confirms that the more apple and mango farmers join the value chain, the higher their household food intake becomes. Support for fruit farmers is, therefore, a promising policy approach that can help improve household food security in rural Ethiopia.

T1  - Seaweed Aquaculture in Indonesia Contributes to Social and Economic Aspects of Livelihoods and Community Wellbeing
AN  - 2581066005
AB  - Seaweed farming in Indonesia is carried out throughout much of the archipelago and is mainly undertaken by smallholder farmers. Indonesia is the largest global producer of the red seaweeds Kappaphycus and Eucheuma, which are used to produce carrageenan, and is a major producer of Gracilaria, which is used to produce agar. Seaweed farming is attractive to farmers in rural coastal communities because capital and operating costs are low, farming techniques are not technically demanding, labour requirements are relatively low (allowing farmers to engage in other livelihoods), and production cycles are short (30–45 days), providing regular income. Using reported values for seaweed-farming income, we conclude that seaweed farming can, but does not always, lift rural households above the Indonesian poverty line. In addition to direct financial benefits, seaweed farming also contributes to human and social capital within seaweed farming households and communities. Achieving continued economic and social benefits from seaweed farming will require additional policy development, as well as research and development to support improved and more consistent seaweed productivity and improved product quality at the farm level, provision of effective extension and technical support services, and diversification of the existing value chains in order to reduce the impacts of price fluctuations that are associated with limited global commodity chains.

T1  - CONTRACT FARMING AND VEGETABLE VALUE CHAIN EFFICIENCY A STUDY FROM QUANG NAM PROVINCE VIETNAM*
AN  - 2577090001
AB  - Contract farming can create new market opportunities and enhance income for smallholder farmers. This study identifies opportunity for contract farming for vegetable growers in relation to cucumber production in Quang Nam province, Vietnam. The study uses data collected from secondary sources and a survey conducted among selected contract and non-contract farmers in Binh Trieu commune in Thang Binh district, Quang Nam province, Vietnam. Benefit-cost analysis was employed to measure the profitability of cucumber production under contract and non-contract farming at farm level. Socioeconomic characters of the contract- and non-contracts farmers were then compared for their economic performance and to identify the constraints surrounding the promotion of contract farming. The results show that there are several benefits in contract farming. In terms of socio-economic characteristics, there are no differences between the contract and the non-contract farmers except their participation in farmers' organizations. Large holding farmers and grower-based cooperatives are much more likely to be selected for contractual arrangement than other farmers. This implies that entrepreneurs tend to be interested in contracts with groups of farmers rather than with individual farmers. Acting collectively is likely to increase bargaining power of the contract farmers and reduce transaction costs. Vegetables can be purchased with higher prices which provides higher net return and profit cost ratio for the contract farmers than those of non-contract growers. Although there is a range of benefits in contract farming, an increase in input prices is one of the obstacles of contract farming and not all farmers can fulfil the requirements for production processes and output quality standards. Delays in payment and limited access to market information are also likely to reduce the participation in contractual agreements. It is recommended that farmers' organizations should be formed to enable a group of farmers to enter the value chain and deal effectively with contract farming situations. Market information should be delivered to farmers through local media and the contracts should be made in the form that farmers can easily understand and comply with them. This study also considers a dual supply chain structure in which farmers either operate independently or in partnership with others. Other actors in the value chain, such as middlemen, entrepreneurs as well as end consumers also have important roles to play.

T1  - Effects of village savings and loan association on agricultural value productivity in Northern Region of Ghana
TT  - Village savings and loan association
AN  - 2576771018
AB  - PurposeAgriculture in Ghana is dominated by smallholder farmers in rural areas. Majority of these farmers are resource-poor and faced with serious challenges in accessing formal financial services towards farming needs attributed to the stringent requirements. To bridge this gap, village savings and loan associations (VSLA) have been promoted in rural areas as an alternative to meeting the credit needs of smallholder farmers. Credit plays a vital role in input acquisition among farmers for improved agricultural value productivity. This study assesses the contribution of VSLA to agricultural value productivity in the Northern Region of Ghana.Design/methodology/approachThe methodology is a primary cross-sectional data collected with the help of a semi-structured questionnaire. This study, therefore, applied a propensity score matching (PSM) to assess the effects of VSLA on agricultural value productivity.FindingsResults from the PSM revealed that extension contact, contract farming, television set ownership, participating in “Planting for Food and Jobs” and nature of roads, including receiving VSLA information from members' increases participation decision of farmers in VSLA. Conversely, age of a farmer, household size, distance to output market and farmers in the Sagnarigu Municipality have negatively influenced VSLA participation. The propensity score matching estimates showed that members of VSLA obtained 38.2% higher agricultural value productivity than non-members.Originality/valueVillage savings and loans associations can be promoted among smallholder farmers as an effective alternative to formal financial service for inclusive development.

T1  - Farmland Rental Participation, Agricultural Productivity, and Household Income: Evidence from Rural China
AN  - 2576451323
AB  - The rural land rental market is playing an increasingly important role in the agricultural transformation period for developing countries, including China, where rural farmland rental is highly context-specific with the implementation of the collective-owned rural land system; thus, in turn, the access to farmland rental markets for rural households has profoundly influenced their livelihood strategies and income earnings. This paper investigates the income impact differences caused by rural households’ farmland rental participation activities and explores such impact mechanisms by further evaluating the income impacts caused by rental area and household agricultural productivity. Data from the Chinese national household survey were used for estimating the empirical models. Our results show that farmland renting has positively affected households’ on-farm and total income, but there is no significant effect upon off-farm income. According to income differences across quantiles, we find households with high on-farm income are more sensitive about enlarging their farm size by renting farmland, and households with middle and upper-middle off-income may benefit more from renting out their farmland. Furthermore, the joint effects of renting area and household agricultural productivity on lessee households’ farm income is significantly positive. For lessor households, our results indicate that renting out farmland did not improve their off-farm and total income as it may have a limited effect on farm household labor distribution. Our findings suggest that engaging in farmland rental activity can enhance farming productivity efficiency and poverty alleviation among rural households. Under the collective-owned rural land system, it is urgent and necessary to initiate and design incentive policies to encourage highly efficient large farms to expand the farm size and provide smallholders with equal opportunities to engage in farmland rental activities.

T1  - Food Loss-Reducing Intervention Strategies for Potato Smallholders in Kenya—A Positive Business Case with Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions
AN  - 2576375737
AB  - This paper is focused on intervention scenarios for smallholder potato value chains in Kenya that improve yields, reduce losses, minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase economic performance and food security. For that, business models and GHG emission estimates are developed, based on the existing data, combined with relevancy and time-to-impact analysis using practical real-life information from stakeholders in the potato sector, which is the second largest agricultural crop in Kenya after maize. The results show that profitability, environmental improvement and food security can go hand in hand with realistic short-term interventions for potato production at smallholder farms.

T1  - Village Environment, Capital Endowment, and Farmers’ Participation in E-Commerce Sales Behavior: A Demand Observable Bivariate Probit Model Approach
AN  - 2576374629
AB  - With the recent developments in widespread internet usage and digital technology, an ultimate worldwide transformation in information and communications technology has occurred. Especially, how people engage in the virtual market for buying and selling goods has changed dramatically, which flourished the playground of electronic commerce (EC). Interestingly, it has become crucial to create an ample opportunity for farmers to utilize a more comprehensive market range for selling their products. However, farmers participating in e-commerce sales platforms may be interrupted by various internal and external factors. Therefore, the study’s primary goal is to evaluate the impacts of various external and internal factors on shaping farmers’ behavior in participating in e-commerce sales platforms. The study utilized a demand observable bivariate Probit model to analyze the village environment and capital endowment effects to craft the findings. The study utilized micro-survey data from 686 households in the leading kiwifruit-producing area as the empirical setup. The findings illustrated that the village environment is the main factor that restricts farmers’ e-commerce sales behavior, among which the infrastructure and policy environments have a significant contribution to farmers’ e-commerce sales intention and behavior. However, the effect of capital endowment on farmers’ e-commerce selling behavior has been found as significant. The village environment significantly affects both large- and small-scale farmers, and the capital endowment has a higher binding effect on small-scale farmers. Therefore, the paper suggests that improving the village environment for e-commerce development and laying the foundation for e-commerce development should be fostered. A differentiated incentive mechanism to improve the capital endowment of farmers should be constructed. A well-structured capital endowment triggering small farmers to capture the benefits of e-commerce sales should be imposed. The government should extend the support of the agricultural demonstration zone to facilitate practical training among the smallholder farmers. The formal and informal risk-sharing and financial institutions should prioritize building infrastructure to support farmers’ short- and long-term investments. Farmers should realize the importance of e-commerce for integrating the agricultural value chain.

T1  - Induced Agricultural Production Organizations under the Transition of Rural Land Market: Evidence from China
AN  - 2576374056
AB  - This paper focuses on the impact of a new rural land reform, the Separation of Three Rights Reform, on changes in China’s agricultural production organizations. We illustrate the impact of market and nonmarket mechanisms on allocating agricultural production factors under the new rural land market transition through a land system and factor allocation model. Based on the expansion paths of different types of factors in the model, we classify the development of Chinese agricultural production entities into “extensional expansion,” “labor-intensive expansion,” “land-intensive expansion,” and “exit of agricultural production.” These agricultural production paths correspond to agricultural enterprises, family farms, agricultural cooperatives, and small farmers’ exit. Further, empirical and economic geography analysis results show that the interaction of market and nonmarket mechanisms is the main drive that induces the current diversified organizations in rural China. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive explanation of changing patterns of an agricultural production organization under the transition of the rural land market.

T1  - The Influence of New Agricultural Business Entities on the Economic Welfare of Farmer’s Families
AN  - 2576373906
AB  - Promoting the coordinated development of new agricultural business entities and small farmers is an important way to realize rural revitalization. It is undoubtedly of great significance to clarify the impact and its mechanism of new agricultural business entities on the economic welfare of farmers’ families. Based on the 2015 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data, this paper builds a theoretical analytical framework of “new agricultural business entities—non-agricultural employment and agricultural output—economic welfare of farmers’ family”. From the intermediary perspective of the non-agricultural employment and agricultural output, it empirically tests the impact of new agricultural business entities on the economic welfare of farmers’ families by combining the analysis methods of the benchmark regression and intermediary effect. The research shows that: (1) New agricultural business entities promote the improvement of the economic welfare of farmers’ families. The specific manifestation is that the existence of new agricultural business entities can not only increase the per capita annual income of farmers’ families, but also promote the per capita consumption expenditure of farmers’ families in the village. (2) Non-agricultural employment and agricultural output have a significant mediating effect in the impact of new agricultural business entities on the economic welfare of farmers’ families. (3) In addition to key variables, variables such as education, political status, and family status are also key factors affecting the economic welfare of farmers’ families. Finally, this paper puts forward some policy recommendations such as cultivating high-quality new agricultural business entities, strengthening farmers’ technical training, and optimizing rural residents’ policies.

T1  - Lao Plantation Policy: Prospects for Change
AN  - 2565238861
AB  - Policies to promote tree plantations in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic have been developed since independence to support national socio-economic and environmental goals, and in response to domestic and international markets. The effectiveness of these policies has been variable, and the resulting plantation wood value chains are poorly developed due to contradictory and confusing laws and regulations with inconsistent application and high transaction costs. Consequently, there has been limited tree plantation investment, and few investments have realized the anticipated benefits. Renewed interest in plantations from the government, investors and other sectors in Laos has prompted policy reviews and recognition of the need for new policy settings. We reviewed the development of plantation policies in Laos and assessed policy effectiveness and barriers to policy options. Through document analysis, interviews with key stakeholders and actors, stakeholder forums, and field research, we found that smarter regulation, and facilitating value-chain partnerships and knowledge sharing, can motivate smallholders and industry investors in plantations, and increase community-level benefits and financial returns to the Government and private sector. These results are discussed in the context of current international developments in plantation policy and the convergence in related policy processes in Laos.

T1  - Agricultural Cooperatives and COVID-19 in Southeast Africa. The Role of Managerial Capital for Rural Resilience
AN  - 2562209241
AB  - While the health impact of COVID-19 in most African countries appears modest, the impact of social distancing measures, closing of markets and reduced mobility is felt across the board. Domestic, labor-intensive and traditional food value chains and the smallholders they serve appear to be particularly affected. During a systemic shock where idiosyncratic risk coping strategies fail, collective or organizational resilience becomes of the essence to protect the livelihoods of smallholders. In this study, we have used pre- and during-shock data on agricultural cooperatives from Southeast Africa to understand how resilient these smallholder-owned organizations are. We find that many organizations could not countervail market-disruptions and fell into a state of dormancy during the pandemic. One reason for this is that collective decision-making was heavily affected by the banning of gatherings. Only a few organizations devised innovative solutions to maintain the market linkages of rural smallholders. The lack of resilience demonstrated by most cooperatives appears to be associated with organizational immaturity, large membership size, elite capture and limited business-orientation, which underscore a general lack of managerial capital.

T1  - Phytosanitary and Technical Quality Challenges in Export Fresh Vegetables and Strategies to Compliance with Market Requirements: Case of Smallholder Snap Beans in Kenya
AN  - 2562208646
AB  - Kenya is one of the leading exporters of snap beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) to Europe, but the export volume has remained below potential mainly due to failure to meet the market quality standards. The quality concerns include the presence of regulated and quarantine pests, pesticide residues, harmful organisms, and noncompliance with the technical standards. These challenges call for the development of alternative approaches in overcoming the phytosanitary and quality challenges in the export of snap beans and other fresh vegetables. These may include integrated pest management (IPM) approaches that incorporate non synthetic chemical options, such as diversified cropping systems, plant and microbial-based pesticides, varieties with multiple disease and pest resistance, insecticidal soaps, pheromones and kairomones, entomopathogens and predators. These approaches, coupled with capacity-building and adherence to the set quality standards, will improve compliance with export market requirements. The aim of this paper is to increase knowledge on implementing good practices across the value chain of fresh vegetables that would lead to improved quality and thereby meeting institutional requirements for the export market. The novelty of the current review is using snap beans as a model vegetable to discuss the challenges that must be mitigated for the quest of achieving high quality and increased volume of fresh export products. Whilst many of the publications have focused on alternatives to synthetic pesticides in addressing MRLs in fresh vegetable exports, there is a disconnect between research and industry in achieving chemical residue and pest free export vegetables. This review describes the phytosanitary and technical challenges faced by smallholder farmers in accessing export markets, evaluates the phytosanitary and quality requirements by the niche markets, and explores the strategies that could be used to enhance compliance to the institutional and market requirements for fresh vegetables.

T1  - Attitudes of Fruit and Vegetable Farmers towards Organic Farming in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal
AN  - 2562195904
AB  - Organic farming is increasingly popular among the farmers of Kathmandu valley. However, the organic growers have been facing issues in production, organic certification, and product marketing. To date, little is known about the challenges faced by the organic growers in Kathmandu valley. This study aimed to explore the status of organic farming, attitudes of farmers towards organic farming, their suggestions for improvement, and strengthening the value chain of organic products. Face-to-face interviews were conducted at Agriculture Knowledge Centre, Lalitpur, Nepal during December 2019 with 37 organic growers directly or indirectly involved in organic farming. The results showed that organic growers face challenges in marketing and institutional recognition. Challenges in product certification and marketing were reported by 45.95% of the total interviewed organic growers while following organic practices (transitional organic). Our study suggested that reducing the cost of production through easy access to organic inputs like organic seeds, fertilizers, and biopesticides are highly desired by the growers. Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) or group certification along with collective marketing could be the policy implications to address the issues. Organic farming in Kathmandu valley is limited to a niche market; however, due to increasing consumer demand for safe, fresh, and local food, the popularity of organic products is extending to other regions within the country.

T1  - Agroforestry Practices in Livelihood Improvement in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa
AN  - 2558955873
AB  - Agroforestry plays a significant role in increasing agricultural productivity. In South Africa, there is a pressing need for promoting smallholder agriculture to promote sustainable rural livelihoods, to ensure food security, to lower inflation in food prices, and address rampant rural unemployment in the country. The agricultural economy is characterised by a monopoly structure where almost every single staple in South Africa is already produced by large manufacturers that can produce it at better quality and lower cost than the average smallholder enterprise or cooperative. Such a monopoly structure fundamentally undermines the development of local markets, where local small-scale producers sell to their local community. The novelty of this study is addressing the research gap that conventional rural livelihood analyses often neglect, i.e., the role of environmental products in general, and forest and agroforestry products. Using a log linear regression model with cross-sectional data collected from a sample of 300 households, this study explores the likely impact of agroforestry practices in promoting the livelihood of rural communities in the study areas. Results obtained from multiple linear regression analysis showed that average household income increased as a function of utilization of agroforestry practices. Agroforestry contributes to sustainable rural livelihoods in South African provinces where the predominant means of livelihoods is rural subsistence farming and agriculture. Since valuation of agroforestry products and services are technically difficult, farmers often underestimate the contribution of agroforestry to the household’s livelihood income. These findings have policy implications in promoting food security in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa and beyond.

T1  - A Success Story of Collective Action Changing Public Policy: Farmers' Innovation in the Face of Repressive Forestry Policy in Zambrana Abajo, Dominican Republic
AN  - 2557850992
AB  - Collective action and capacity building locally are key elements in overcoming poverty through agroforestry and community silviculture. Starting from extreme poverty, degraded soils and a reluctance to plant trees, the communities of Zambrana Abajo in the Dominican Republic were able to confront and change repressive forestry policies, obtaining the first legal right amongst smallholders to harvest timber and establish new livelihoods related to forestry and agroforestry. This study was carried out in order to identify the success factors and the lessons learned in this process. Qualitative research methods were used, including participant observation, review of literature, in-depth interviews with key informants, and semi-structured interviews guided by the Community Capitals Framework. It was found that community participation, local knowledge and the authorities’ recognition of it had an impact on forestry policy and overcoming poverty through livelihood diversification thanks to harvesting the species Acacia mangium Willd. The level of understanding about the benefits of trees influenced farmers' decisions to participate in agroforestry and community silviculture projects. The possibility of harvesting timber also influenced farmers' decision to participate and in the diffusion of this initiative to other parts of the country. These findings demonstrate that human capital and its recognition are relevant in improving quality of life for families and improving the natural environment.

T1  - Mango Postharvest Technologies: An Observational Study of the Yieldwise Initiative in Kenya
AN  - 2554331439
AB  - Several studies have evaluated the effects of postharvest technologies on postharvest loss (PHL) incurred at a single stage of a food value chain. However, very few studies have assessed the effect of multiple technologies on PHL incurred at various stages of a food value chain. This study evaluated the effect of five technologies (harvesting tools, cold stores, plastic crates, fruit fly traps, and ground tarps) promoted by the Rockefeller Foundation Yieldwise Initiative (YWI) in Kenya on PHL incurred at three mango value chain stages (harvest, transportation, and point of sale). After extensive screening of the YWI data, the Kruskal–Wallis statistical test was used to compare each YWI promoted technology to smallholder farmers (SHF) traditional practices. Results indicated that plastic crates used to transport or store mangos and fruit fly traps used to attract and kill fruit flies were statistically significant (p < 0.05) in reducing PHL at the point of sale. Meanwhile, no statistical evidence of PHL reduction was observed from SHF using harvesting tools, cold stores, and ground tarps. Cold stores were the least adopted of the promoted technologies due to their high costs of implementation and utilization. While this study asserts that increased technology adoption is associated with PHL reduction, further research is needed to identify additional factors that favor technologies’ efficacy in reducing PHL in similar food value chains.

T1  - Knowledge, perceptions and effects of Ebola virus disease outbreak on the pig value chain in the agro-pastoralist district of Luwero, Central Uganda
AN  - 2552839949
AB  - Background 
Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreaks have a significant impact on the health and wellbeing, and livelihoods of communities. EVD response interventions particularly affect the food value chain, and income security of pig farmers in agro-pastoral communities. Despite the enormous effort of EVD response interventions, there is paucity of information towards EVD among those involved in the pig value chain, as well as the effect of EVD outbreaks on the pig value chain. This study therefore, assessed the knowledge, perceptions on the occurrence of Ebola and its effects on the pig value chain in the agro-pastoral district of Luweero, Central Uganda.
 Methods 
A cross sectional study was conducted in two parishes of Ssambwe and Ngalonkulu, Luwero district. A total of 229 respondents were included in the study. Structured questionnaires, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were conducted to collect data. Quantitative data was analysed using SPSS version 22 while qualitative data was analysed using thematic content analysis.
 Results 
Of the 229 respondents, 95.6% could recall the occurrence of the last EVD outbreak in their locality. About 24.5% associated EVD with touching pigs or eating pork. Regarding knowledge, 194 (84.7%) correctly associated EVD with handling Ebola infected persons, 191 (83.4%) with migration of people from endemic areas, 148 (64.9%) eating monkey meat, 127 (55.5%) with eating bats, and 198 (64.9%) with conducting public meetings where there is an Ebola infected person. Out of 142 farmers, 55 (38.7%) believed that Ebola outbreaks affected demand and sale of pigs. The EVD outbreak significantly led to a reduction in the average number of pigs sold (P = 0.001), the average number of pigs bought by traders (P = 0.04), and the number of pigs sold/ slaughtered by butcher men at pork eating places (P = 0.03).
 Conclusion 
This study showed that EVD outbreak negatively affected the pig value chain i.e., the demand and supply of pigs and pork. Therefore, there is need to sensitize the stakeholders in the pig value chain on EVD in order to minimize the negative economic impacts associated with EVD outbreaks.

T1  - Bounded Rationality, Social Capital and Technology Adoption in Family Farming: Evidence from Cocoa-Tree Crops in Ivory Coast
AN  - 2549703485
AB  - In this paper, we allege that the hypothesis in favor of bounded rationality is a plausible explanation when it comes to better understanding the sluggish pace of adoption of best available tree crop farming techniques in poor small-scale rural communities. Our research builds on data collection and analysis of cocoa farming in Ivory Coast. Firstly, we find that the cognitive scarcity under which smallholder farmers make their decisions, in particular, satisficing behavior and fast and frugal heuristics, outweigh the scarcity of financial and human resources. Secondly, we show that the structure of the environment measured through various dimensions of social capital influences human rationality and decision-making. On the one hand, the greater smallholder farmers’ civic capital (solidarity, reciprocity, trustworthiness, cooperation), the more likely they are to modify their farming practices (p < 0.05) and, more specifically, to exchange information, learn, and eventually revise these practices. On the other hand, the greater the number of organizations the farmers participate in, the greater the probability of modifying their practices (p < 0.01). Information about farming techniques disseminates through weak bridging ties built within agricultural organizations (e.g., cooperatives, extension services) rather than through strong bonding ties between family or diaspora members.

T1  - Corporate Power in the Bioeconomy Transition: The Policies and Politics of Conservative Ecological Modernization in Brazil
AN  - 2545194577
AB  - The bioeconomy transition is a double-edged sword that may either address fossil fuel dependence sustainably or aggravate human pressures on the environment, depending on how it is pursued. Using the emblematic case of Brazil, this article analyzes how corporate agribusiness dominance limits the bioeconomy agenda, shapes innovation pathways, and ultimately threatens the sustainability of this transition. Drawing from scholarship on power in agri-food governance and sustainability transitions, an analytical framework is then applied to the Brazilian case. The analysis of current policies, recent institutional changes and the case-specific literature reveals that, despite a strategic framing of the bioeconomy transition as a panacea for job creation, biodiversity conservation and local development (particularly for the Amazon region), in practice major soy, sugarcane and meatpacking conglomerates dominate Brazil’s bioeconomy agenda. In what can be described as conservative ecological modernization, there is some reflexivity regarding environmental issues but also an effort to maintain (unequal) social and political structures. Significant agribusiness dominance does not bode well for smallholder farmers, food diversity or natural ecosystems, as major drivers of deforestation and land-use change (e.g., soy plantations, cattle ranching) gain renewed economic and political stimulus as well as greater societal legitimacy under the bioeconomy umbrella.

T1  - Non-Timber Forest Products and the Cosmetic Industry: An Econometric Assessment of Contributions to Income in the Brazilian Amazon
AN  - 2544889996
AB  - This study explores Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) production and company–community partnerships with the multinational cosmetic industry. The objectives are to critically assess: (1) how income generated from market-oriented NTFPs extraction impacts small farmers’ livelihoods; and (2) whether membership in cooperatives linked to such partnerships is a factor in improved livelihood. Household-level data from 282 surveys conducted in remote communities in four municipalities in the Northeast region of the State of Pará provide empirical insight into NTFPs extraction and processing activities by smallholder farmers in the Brazilian Amazon. We employ a spatial econometric approach to assess if engagement in NTFPs extraction and membership in cooperatives result in statistically significant increases in the overall household income. A series of spatial regression models are used, including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Spatial Autoregressive Regression (SAR), Spatial Error Model (SEM), Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) and their corresponding alternative Bayesian models. Our study finds that NTFP extraction and membership in cooperatives tied to company–community partnerships are statistically significant and result in increases in total income at the household level. Findings also show that distance to transportation modes and markets are statistically significant with more distant households earning greater income. This finding presents challenges for the long-term sustainability of green alternatives to development that rely on remote, inaccessible environments for the commodities of interest. This is especially pronounced given the commitment of the Amazonian Nations, and the massive national and international investments, in the Initiative for the Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America (IIRSA), which has as its goal the creation of a multimodal transportation hub to integrate the continent with global markets and make accessible far reaches of the Amazon.

T1  - Recognizing Determinants to Smallholders’ Market Orientation and Marketing Arrangements: Building on a Case of Dairy Farming in Rural Kenya
AN  - 2544889981
AB  - Smallholder commercialization is central to international development policy and practice. As a result, several arrangements to foster market linkages are being implemented. Especially popular are farmers’ organizations, which are believed to be owned, controlled, and financed by smallholders. As such, their design is considered inclusive given every household in a community is theoretically allowed to become a member, and the governance and management structure encourage participatory decision-making. However, even in the context in which farmers’ organizations are actively promoted, a notable proportion of smallholders may not be able to engage in market-oriented production or may opt for the existing alternative marketing arrangements, as dictated by individual households’ socioeconomic characteristics. Focusing on the case of smallholder farming in Olenguruone, Nakuru county, Kenya, where a donor funded dairy farmers’ cooperative marketing arrangement is promoted alongside existing marketing opportunities, the present research investigated the factors that determine smallholders’ commercial farming orientation and marketing arrangements. It employed a case study approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative research methods for a more complete empirical inquiry. The findings demonstrate that irrespective of the external support provided through marketing opportunities such as farmer organizations, smallholders’ engagement in commercial farming and marketing is dictated by the socioeconomic attributes and market perceptions that are heterogeneous among households in a smallholder community.

T1  - Does Participation in Agricultural Value Chain Activities Influence Smallholder Fruit Grower Production Performance? A Cross-Sectional Study of Apple Farmers in Shandong, China
AN  - 2544838199
AB  - The value chain comprises several factors and activities useful for strengthening production and distribution by connecting producers with suppliers, intermediaries, and marketplaces and collaboratively creating added value for products or goods. However, the values of agricultural products mostly depend on various factors and actors, which should be linked together for fostering added values. Thus, there may be strong ground for facilitating a smooth transition of the agricultural value chain (AVC) within the prospects of emerging countries. It could be a key means of promoting a profound connection between smallholder farmers and modern agriculture facilities. It could be especially crucial for the highly perishable and high-value product such as fruits. The main aims of the study are to evaluate the factors influencing smallholder apple farmers’ participation in the agricultural value chain and determine whether participation in AVC improves farmers’ production performance. The empirical setup of the study was chosen based on survey data of apple growers in Shandong, China. The propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) models were employed to craft the study’s outcomes. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) Fruit farmers’ gender, total household expenditure, housing value, planting scale, planting years, degree of specialization, days of family labour input, and total days of employment have significant effects on their participation in AVC activities. (2) Fruit farmers’ usage of improved fertilizers and organization participation supports a higher yield and net income per acre. (3) Participating in two kinds of AVC can significantly improve the yield per acre and net income per acre compared with only using one type of AVC (improved fertilizer). Policy makers should improve the existing policy by eliminating institutional barriers and enhancing human factors for farmers to participate in high-value chain activities. Governments should extend technical support, and enhance training facilities, and comprehensively promote the AVC among smallholder farmers. Finally, farmers’ organizations (e.g., cooperatives and credit organizations) should come forward to help facilitate the effectiveness of AVC.

T1  - A CASE STUDY OF INCLUSIVE BUSINESS MODEL USING BUSINESS MODEL CANVAS FOR CONTRACT FARMING
AN  - 2541951102
AB  - Key objective of this paper is to identify the contract farming business model, which enhances the integration of smallholder farmers into Thailand's banana value chain, by analysis of business model canvas. This analysis was based on a survey of small-scale banana growers, as well as in-depth interviews with key informants. The paper revealed that the business model, where private company contracts farmer group, was the most effective, in terms of average net income received by small-scale farmers. A farmer group plays a key role in linking an agribusiness company to small-scale farmers. With the company's key resource of having production expertise and marketing networks, it provides technical knowledge, assistance, and advice to strengthen farmer group's capability. Farmer group's commitment on high-quality banana production and willingness to learn enables the farmer group to successfully manage its purchasing from members and post-harvesting activities.

T1  - Dynamics of banks' lending practices to farmers in India
TT  - Banks' lending practices
AN  - 2533461923
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to evaluate whether small marginal farmers in India have financial constraints and to examine how bank managers make lending decisions.Design/methodology/approachA survey approach was employed, using semi-structured questionnaires with a sample of 42 banks and 185 farmers from the state of Punjab in India. The questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were carried out on a one-to-one basis and in focus groups, and their responses were analysed from the supply (banks) and demand (farmers) side regarding access to finance.FindingsThe results indicate that the Indian farming sector is a complex and multidimensional one that has dependency on both the private and public sectors because of its national importance to varying degrees. Financial lending decisions are dependent upon several non-quantifiable factors (culture, caste, family size, education) and relational bank lending practices. Such practices have an adverse impact on bankable loan applications, and this gives rise to moral hazards. Relational banking and recommendations minimise default rates, but this does not minimise information asymmetry. Subjectivity in decision-making persists, which is compounded by underdeveloped financial markets for small farmers, giving rise to financial exclusion and negatively impacting on economic growth. To overcome information asymmetry, banks rely on the qualitative factors and an excessive level of collateral when making lending decisions. The findings provide valuable insight into how banks make lending decisions and evaluates a complex matrix of relationships between farmers and providers of debt finance in a developing economy such as India.Practical implicationsPolicy makers nationally and internationally could use the results of this research to develop relevant and targeted policies to promote the agricultural sector through adopting efficient provision of finance for farmers. A major contribution of this research is to provide a fundamental evaluation of the issues facing farmers in accessing finance in developing countries.Originality/valueThis study provides an original empirical insight into a sector of the economy that has implications for food security for a country. The study has relevance for a wide range of stakeholders and policy makers of both developed and emerging economies in the world.

T1  - Evaluating the Impacts of Smallholder Farmer’s Participation in Modern Agricultural Value Chain Tactics for Facilitating Poverty Alleviation—A Case Study of Kiwifruit Industry in Shaanxi, China
AN  - 2531366527
AB  - Market-based initiatives like agriculture value chain (AVC) are becoming progressively pervasive to support smallholder rural farmers and assist them in entering larger market interventions and providing a pathway of enhancing their socioeconomic well-being. Moreover, it may also foster staggering effects towards the post-era poverty alleviation in rural areas and possessed a significant theoretical and practical influence for modern agricultural development. The prime objective of the study is to explore the effects of smallholder farmers’ participation in the agricultural value chain for availing rural development and poverty alleviation. Specifically, we have crafted the assessment employing pre-production (improved fertilizers usage), in-production (modern preservation technology), and post-production (supply chain) participation and interventions of smallholder farmers. The empirical data has been collected from a micro survey dataset of 623 kiwifruit farmers from July to September in Shaanxi, China. We have employed propensity score matching (PSM), probit, and OLS models to explore the multidimensional poverty reduction impact and heterogeneity of farmers’ participation in the agricultural value chain. The results show that the total number of poor farmers who have experienced one-dimensional and two-dimensional poverty is relatively high (66.3%). We also find that farmers’ participation in agricultural value chain activities has a significant poverty reduction effect. The multidimensional poverty level of farmers using improved fertilizer, organizational acquisition, and using storage technology (compared with non-participating farmers) decreased by 30.1%, 46.5%, and 25.0%, respectively. The multidimensional poverty reduction degree of male farmers using improved fertilizer and participating in the organizational acquisition is greater than that of women. The multidimensional poverty reduction degree of female farmers using storage and fresh-keeping technology has a greater impact than the males using storage and improved storage technology. Government should widely promote the value chain in the form of pre-harvest, production, and post-harvest technology. The public–private partnership should also be strengthened for availing innovative technologies and infrastructure development.

T1  - Determinants of Rice Farmer Participation in the Direct Marketing Channel in Ghana
AN  - 2530166319
AB  - Enhancing smallholder farmers’ access to reliable, ready, and direct marketing channels is a prerequisite for sustainable food supply and poverty reduction in the developing countries including Ghana. However, it is a great challenge for smallholder farmers to access direct marketing channels in Ghana. This paper analyzes the factors that influence smallholder rice farmers’ participation, and the intensity of participation, in direct marketing channels using primary data from 199 farmers in three rice-growing districts in the Northern Region of Ghana. A double hurdle model was used in the empirical analysis. The study findings show that a lower percentage of farmers sold their rice output to processors (direct marketing). Farm size, the price of rice output per 85 kg bag, access to market information, and access to credit increased farmers’ participation in direct marketing channels, whereas payment period and ownership of a bicycle reduced their participation. The study concludes that improving farmers’ access to market information and credit availability would enhance participation in direct marketing channels.

T1  - Effectiveness of Training and Use of Novasil Binder in Mitigating Aflatoxins in Cow Milk Produced in Smallholder Farms in Urban and Periurban Areas of Kenya
AN  - 2530130474
AB  - Aflatoxins, which commonly contaminate animal feeds and human food, present a major public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. After ingestion by cows, aflatoxin B1 is metabolized to aflatoxin M1 (AFM1), some of which is excreted in milk. This study involved smallholder dairy farms in urban and periurban areas of Nairobi and Kisumu, Kenya. The objective was to determine the effectiveness of training and providing farmers with aflatoxin binder (NovaSil®) on AFM1 contamination in raw milk. A baseline survey was undertaken and 30 farmers whose milk had AFM1 levels above 20 ppt were randomly selected for inclusion in the study. Of these, 20 farmers were part of the intervention, and were given training on the usage of the NovaSil® binder, while 10 served as a control group. All farmers were visited biweekly for three months for interviews and milk samples were collected to measure the AFM1 levels. The AFM1 levels were quantified by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The NovaSil® binder significantly reduced AFM1 concentrations in the raw milk produced by the farmers in the intervention group over the duration of the study (p < 0.01). The control farms were more likely to have milk with AFM1 levels exceeding the regulatory limit of 50 ppt compared to the intervention farms (p < 0.001) (odds ratio = 6.5). The farmers in the intervention group perceived that there was an improvement in milk yield, and in cow health and appetite. These farmers also felt that the milk they sold, as well as the one they used at home, was safer. In conclusion, the use of binders by dairy farmers can be effective in reducing AFM1 in milk. Further research is needed to understand their effectiveness, especially when used in smallholder settings.

T1  - Socioeconomic Determinants of Crop Diversity and Its Effect on Farmer Income in Guangxi, Southern China
AN  - 2528298329
AB  - Encouraging crop diversity could be a “win–win” for farmers and biodiversity conservation, if having a variety of crops produces the heterogeneity that supports biodiversity, and if multiple crops decrease the risk of farmers to losses due to pests, climatic events or market fluctuations, without strongly reducing their incomes. However, data on the factors that influence the decision to plant multiple crops, and how that affects profit, are needed, especially for East Asia, where these questions have been little studied. We distributed a questionnaire on these issues to 301 farmers in 35 villages in an agricultural area close to the city of Nanning in Guangxi, south China. Crop diversity increased with land size and closeness to the city. We detected no relationship between profit variability and crop diversity, but farmers with greater crop diversity and more land were more profitable, a result driven by several rarely planted but lucrative types of crops. Crop diversity can be a focus for policy to improve farmers’ livelihoods; these policies need to encourage farmers with little land to form cooperatives. Further research is needed to understand the effect of crop diversity on profit variability, and in areas closer to protected areas where biodiversity is higher.

T1  - The Role of Social Enterprise Hybrid Business Models in Inclusive Value Chain Development
AN  - 2524987505
AB  - This study contributes to the growing interest in hybrid organisations, sustainable business models and inclusive value chain development (IVCD). Recent work has identified that of some 570 million farmers in the world, more than 475 million farmers are smallholders in low-middle-income countries experiencing increasing food insecurity and rural poverty. Research argues that there is a lack of research that provides work on appropriate solutions for smallholders. This paper answers this call by a qualitative study of ten case studies, which draws on hybrid organising, sustainable business model and IVCD research to identify the novel business model characteristics that hybrid organisations use to create and manage more inclusive value chains for smallholders. These hybrid organisations are designed to create a value proposition that delivers sustainability upgrading for smallholders via both product, process and governance upgrades, empowers smallholders to achieve development goals and creates multiple value for social impact. We therefore identify the important characteristics of the hybrid business model to provide appropriate solutions for smallholders and overcome the challenges identified in the inclusive value chain development literature.

T1  - Impact of Climate Change on Cotton Production in Bangladesh
AN  - 2524984749
AB  - Bangladesh produces only 5% of the cotton she needs to sustain her readymade garments industries. The country has very limited agricultural land and cotton competes with other crops for this scarce land resource. On top of that, Bangladesh is regarded as a country where agriculture is highly vulnerable to the variabilities of weather patterns that result from climate change. Against this backdrop, to better understand the potential for the sustainable expansion of cotton production in Bangladesh, we examine cotton’s agricultural value chain and projected climate risks associated with different phases of the chain. We identified associated stakeholders at different phases of cotton production, engaged with them to understand climatic and non-climatic threats and developed an integrated set of recommendations for climate-risk management through improving the connection of producers to markets, increasing economic returns to small farmers, and improving efficiency along the value chain. We discussed our estimated climate projections with stakeholders to understand the challenges at different stages of production and marketing, and together explored and identified probable solutions. This research offers a new and evolving approach to assess climate change impact on agriculture utilizing a holistic approach, which could be adopted for other crops.

T1  - Conservation and Use of Latin American Maize Diversity: Pillar of Nutrition Security and Cultural Heritage of Humanity
AN  - 2524311793
AB  - Latin America is the center of domestication and diversity of maize, the second most cultivated crop worldwide. In this region, maize landraces are fundamental for food security, livelihoods, and culture. Nevertheless, genetic erosion (i.e., the loss of genetic diversity and variation in a crop) threatens the continued cultivation and in situ conservation of landrace diversity that is crucial to climate change adaptation and diverse uses of maize. We provide an overview of maize diversity in Latin America before discussing factors associated with persistence of large in situ maize diversity, causes for maize landrace abandonment by farmers, and strategies to enhance the cultivation of landraces. Among other factors, maize diversity is linked with: (1) small-holder farming, (2) the production of traditional food products, (3) traditional cropping systems, (4) cultivation in marginal areas, and (5) retention of control over the production system by the farmers. On the other hand, genetic erosion is associated with substitution of landraces with hybrid varieties or cash crops, and partial (off-farm labor) or complete migration to urban areas. Continued cultivation, and therefore on-farm conservation of genetic diversity held in maize landraces, can be encouraged by creating or strengthening market opportunities that make the cultivation of landraces and open pollinated varieties (OPVs) more profitable for farmers, supporting breeding programs that prioritize improvement of landraces and their special traits, and increasing the access to quality germplasm of landraces and landrace-derived OPVs.

T1  - Review of Macadamia Production in Malawi: Focusing on What, Where, How Much Is Produced and Major Constraints
AN  - 2524211325
AB  - Macadamia is an essential commodity crop in Malawi. The nuts are a lucrative commodity and are used for household consumption, income generation among farming families and as a foreign exchange earning crop at country-level. Macadamia production in Malawi has increased significantly in recent years. Malawi is the seventh top producer of macadamia nuts valued at £23.5 million, with a global market share of 3%. In 2018, the country was the fourth-largest exporter of macadamia nuts that were valued at £18.2 million. The majority (90%) of this crop was grown by large commercial estates with smallholder’s production only contributing about 10% of the total crop production. However, the smallholder sector is vital for the future growth of the macadamia sector in the country. Further, Malawian smallholders consider macadamia production as a low-input crop with large returns per unit area (£10.7 kg−1 ha−1), and it thus a lucrative commodity with high potential for poverty reduction and wealth creation among these farming families. This paper, therefore, explores: (i) the historical and current trends in macadamia nut production in Malawi; (ii) analyses the country’s macadamia value chain focusing on smallholder farmer contributions; and (iii) discusses the constraints of smallholder macadamia production in Malawi for informed policymaking. We conclude that the synthesis of the Malawian macadamia sub-sector provides an understanding of the vital contributions of macadamia to Malawi’s economic growth and improvement of livelihoods.

T1  - Combining Total Cost of Ownership and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to Improve Cost Management in Family Farming
AN  - 2524211100
AB  - Family farming is an important pillar of the global primary food sector and is characterized by a significant local and regional impact. The sustainability of these businesses depends greatly on the use of effective management practices in family farming and smallholder farmer’s activities. However, there is a lack of methodologies to support decision making in this sector related to the recognition of all aspects involved in the acquisition of inputs. Commonly, the existing approaches are focused on cost as the major criterion, which might impact on the agribusiness sustainability in the short or long term. Furthermore, traditional cost-focused approaches should be complemented with multi-criteria aspects within comprehensive and practical methodologies. This paper presents a Cost Management Model (CMM) integrating the concepts of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), which includes both monetary and non-monetary attributes. The use of TCO was mostly focused on industrial applications and studies on costs in agribusiness are still scarce and incomplete. The model was applied to a set of agribusiness families in Southern Brazil to support the supplier selection process of the three main inputs (i.e., fertilizer, fungicide, and soybeans). A significant cost reduction of approximately 13% for fertilizers, 7% for fungicides, and 3% for soybeans can be achieved. The CMM can be applied by smallholder farmers in any region of the world, and its flexibility allows changes in weights and criteria at any time by the decision maker. Buyers are more prepared to select the best supplier for each input and the later can recognize how they are more or less competitive when all costs and relevant criteria are taken into consideration. It can be also applied from an industry-level perspective to highlight the industry’s cost structure and value chain, supporting more focused and effective public policies namely the design of subsidies that mitigate relevant context costs and the investment in infrastructures. Both, subsidies and public investment, are of major importance in rural areas of developing countries.

T1  - Exploring the synergy between Community Supported Agriculture and agroforestry: Institutional innovation from smallholders in a brazilian rural settlement
AN  - 2518777517
AB  - Agroforestry Systems (AFS) are among the productive systems which have the potential of conciliation between food production, conservation of ecosystem services and even recovery of degraded areas. Several studies have helped to reduce uncertainty regarding the economic performance of these productive systems. However, many financial viability studies of AFS assume that farmers will have access both to finance and to market outlets to dispose of all produce, unrealistic assumptions for smallholders, especially in agrarian reform settlements. In addition, the time for AFS to pay for themselves could be a barrier to the adoption of this type of system by smallholders. This paper aims to show how an institutional innovation for marketing fresh food – such as Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) – can influence positively the adoption of agroforestry systems by smallholders. The research is based on a case study of an agroecological producer association in a Brazilian agrarian reform settlement and on a financial viability analysis of one AFS, considering two marketing outlet scenarios. The main contribution of this paper is to discuss the potentialities of the CSA marketing arrangement for smallholders outside the North American and European contexts, and within the agroforestry farming environment. In this arrangement, the farmer does not have to prioritize few and specific species because of their high commercial value. Therefore, it can foster a more systemic and ecological approach to farming. The financial indicators show that the most pessimistic CSA scenario is still superior to the most optimistic organic market scenario, in the context of marketing agroforestry products in the Brazilian Federal District. The economic security resulting from this institutional innovation underscores the potential for synergy between agroforestry systems and CSAs.

T1  - Adapting food systems to the twin challenges of phosphorus and climate vulnerability: the case of Sri Lanka
AN  - 2514012528
AB  - Two of the biggest global challenges for food security – phosphorus scarcity and climate change – are threatening farmers’ livelihoods, agricultural productivity and environmental integrity. In Sri Lanka, the agricultural sector is comprised largely of smallholder farmers where rain-fed rice is often a staple. Yet climate change projections indicate rice yields could drop by 40%, affecting the majority of farmers, and poverty levels could increase from 17% to 33%. At the same time, fertilisers are highly subsidized, without which farmers in this import-dependent island state would be exposed to future price fluctuations like the 800% phosphate price spike in 2008. Collaborative research between Sri Lankan and Australian researchers investigated the capacity of smallholder farmers, policy-makers and other food system stakeholders in Sri Lanka to adapt to these twin challenges via a participatory rapid integrated vulnerability assessment framework. We find that while Sri Lanka is vulnerable, there are many adaptive strategies already in place or planned. Although these strategies are not driven by climate change adaptation or phosphorus scarcity, they could be strengthened to support phosphorus and climate smart agriculture (PACSA). Sri Lanka’s food production is in the midst of a major transformation, largely driven by the President’s push for organic agriculture and organic fertilisers, waste-to-energy systems implemented through public-private partnerships, and the National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change. There are many ‘win-win’ PACSA opportunities both on- and off-farm, such as developing crop varieties that are drought-tolerant and need less phosphorus fertiliser and improved cold storage in the food value chain to reduce food losses.

T1  - Large investments, small farmers: A financialisation perspective on value chains in a development corridor
AN  - 2508024293
AB  - Development corridors have recently gained momentum as territorial tools to attract flows of global capital into agricultural value chains. As this includes the controversial blending of public with private funding for investments into farmland, the integration of smallholders in large-scale operations is increasingly promoted as legitimatory practice. With this article, we discuss the role of finance in shaping such value chain arrangements. Using a spatially sensible financialisation perspective, we present two investment cases that have touched ground as reaction to the promotion of the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT). We assess how finance unfolded along territorial (corridor region and investment origin) and relational (investment chain and value chain) spatialities, to scrutinise the tensions and fragile outcomes that were co-constituted by mixed financial and moral investment imperatives. This helps to understand whether, why, and with what consequences smallholders can benefit from corridor-related investments.

T1  - How Are Smallholder Farmers Involved in Digital Agriculture in Developing Countries: A Case Study from China
AN  - 2497614888
AB  - Digital transformation in agricultural practices may lead to a "digital divide" between small and large farms, owing to the characteristics and availability of digital technology. This paper sought to use a case study in Chongzhou County, Sichuan Province in China, to analyze how smallholder farmers in developing countries access such digital agriculture and share the benefits of digital agricultural transformation. Small farmers may own a larger scale farm through forming cooperatives; they are also indirectly involved in digital agriculture through agriculture outsourcing. The outsourcing market is expected to grow, which will allow for the evolution of a digital agricultural service platform, the development of a digital agricultural business organization consortium, and the continued expansion of a healthy digital ecology. This paper revealed important policy implications, stemming from the fact that the implementation of inclusive digital agriculture relies on two key shifts: (1) transformation from land scale operations to service scale operations and (2) from inclusive technological progress to inclusive organization innovation.

T1  - The Agrarian, Structural and Cultural Constraints of Smallholders’ Readiness for Sustainability Standards Implementation: The Case of Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil in East Kalimantan
AN  - 2497469023
AB  - The expansion of oil palm plantation has caused adverse impacts on the ecosystem. It has been associated with deforestation, biodiversity loss, disturbances to environmental services and livelihood change. The government of Indonesia has made an effort to control the negative effects by issuing relevant policies. One of the policies is Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO)’s sustainability standards to which large-scale plantations and smallholders are obliged to adhere. This study assesses the readiness of two types of smallholders, namely, the nucleus–plasma scheme and independent smallholders to adopt ISPO standards. Using a case study research approach in two oil palm plantation villages in East Kalimantan, the study found out a number of ISPO implementation challenges, grouped into structural and socio-cultural challenges, which make smallholders less ready to adhere to this mandatory policy. Coping with these challenges, this study proposed that land and business legality programs be expedited to strengthen property rights, and that training and education programs be intensified to enhance awareness, knowledge and capacity of smallholders to enable them to comply with sustainability standards.

T1  - Feed-Based Multi-Mycotoxin Occurrence in Smallholder Dairy Farming Systems of South Africa: The Case of Limpopo and Free State
AN  - 2493777453
AB  - Mycotoxin contamination of feed does not only cut across food and feed value chains but compromises animal productivity and health, affecting farmers, traders and consumers alike. To aid in the development of a sustainable strategy for mycotoxin control in animal-based food production systems, this study focused on smallholder farming systems where 77 dairy cattle feed samples were collected from 28 smallholder dairy establishments in the Limpopo and Free State provinces of South Africa between 2018 and 2019. Samples were analyzed using a confirmatory UHPLC–MS/MS (Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) method validated for simultaneous detection of 23 mycotoxins in feeds. Overall, mycotoxins assessed were detected across samples with 86% of samples containing at least one mycotoxin above respective decision limits; up to 66% of samples were found to be contaminated with at least three mycotoxins. Findings demonstrated that deoxynivalenol, sterigmatocystin, alternariol and enniatin B were the most common mycotoxins, while low to marginal detection rates were observed for all other mycotoxins with none of the samples containing fusarenon-X, HT-2-toxin and neosolaniol. Isolated cases of deoxynivalenol (maximum: 2385 µg/kg), aflatoxins (AFB1 (maximum: 30.2 µg/kg)/AFG1 (maximum: 23.1 µg/kg)), and zearalenone (maximum: 1793 µg/kg) in excess of local and European regulatory limits were found. Kruskal–Wallis testing for pairwise comparisons showed commercial feed had significantly higher contamination for deoxynivalenol and its acylated derivatives, ochratoxin A and fumonisins (FB1 and FB2), whereas forages had significantly higher alternariol; in addition to significantly higher fumonisin B1 contamination for Limpopo coupled with significantly higher enniatin B and sterigmatocystin for Free State. Statistically significant Spearman correlations (p < 0.01) were also apparent for ratios for deoxynivalenol/fumonisin B1 (rs = 0.587) and zearalenone/alternariol methylether (rs = 0.544).

T1  - The COVID-19 Induced Disruptions across Groundnut Value Chain: Empirical Evidence from South India
AN  - 2487693896
AB  - We study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the groundnut value chain and all the actors involved in its value chain in Ananthapuramu district of Andhra Pradesh, a leading groundnut producing state in south India. The results revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic created a double burden on farmers by disrupting farm production on one side and decreased diet diversity on the other. Disruption in farm productions resulted in a decline in household income and increased consumer food prices. The effect on farmers snowballed to other actors in the value chain, and all the actors were affected variably. Availability of storage infrastructure would have saved the farmer’s household income to some extent during the pandemic. Supply of diverse nutrient foods through the existing public distribution system, which mostly provides wheat and rice, might have helped tackle the diet diversity issue amongst farmers. Farmer’s collectives were perceived to reduce the negative impact during natural disasters like the COVID-19 pandemic by helping to organise smallholder farmers, minimise transaction costs and increase their bargaining power. In addition, effective farm extension services, including market information, could have benefited farmers during the crisis.

T1  - Prevalence of Aflatoxin- and Fumonisin-Producing Fungi Associated with Cereal Crops Grown in Zimbabwe and Their Associated Risks in a Climate Change Scenario
AN  - 2486553370
AB  - In most sub-Saharan African countries, staple cereal grains harbor many fungi and some produce mycotoxins that negatively impact health and trade. Maize and three small grain cereals (sorghum, pearl millet, and finger millet) produced by smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe during 2016 and 2017 were examined for fungal community structure, and total aflatoxin (AF) and fumonisin (FM) content. A total of 800 maize and 180 small grain samples were collected at harvest and during storage from four agroecological zones. Fusarium spp. dominated the fungi associated with maize. Across crops, Aspergillusflavus constituted the main Aspergillus spp. Small grain cereals were less susceptible to both AF and FM. AF (52%) and FM (89%) prevalence was higher in maize than in small grains (13–25% for AF and 0–32% for FM). Less than 2% of small grain samples exceeded the EU regulatory limit for AF (4 µg/kg), while <10% exceeded the EU regulatory limit for FM (1000 µg/kg). For maize, 28% and 54% of samples exceeded AF and FM Codex guidance limits, respectively. Higher AF contamination occurred in the drier and hotter areas while more FM occurred in the wetter year. AF exposure risk assessment revealed that small grain consumption posed low health risks (≤0.02 liver cancer cases/100,000 persons/year) while maize consumption potentially caused higher liver cancer rates of up to 9.2 cases/100,000 persons/year depending on the locality. Additionally, FM hazard quotients from maize consumption among children and adults were high in both years, but more so in a wet year than a dry year. Adoption of AF and FM management practices throughout the maize value chain coupled with policies supporting dietary diversification are needed to protect maize consumers in Zimbabwe from AF- and FM-associated health effects. The higher risk of health burden from diseases associated with elevated concentration of mycotoxins in preferred maize during climate change events can be relieved by increased consumption of small grains.

T1  - Conservation and Use of Latin American Maize Diversity: Pillar of Nutrition Security and Cultural Heritage of Humanity
AN  - 2480019685
AB  - Latin America is the center of domestication and diversity of maize, the second most cultivated crop worldwide. In this region, maize landraces are fundamental for food security, livelihoods, and culture. Nevertheless, genetic erosion (i.e., the loss of genetic diversity and variation in a crop) threatens the continued cultivation and in situ conservation of landrace diversity that is crucial to climate change adaptation and diverse uses of maize. We provide an overview of maize diversity in Latin America before discussing factors associated with persistence of large in situ maize diversity, causes for maize landrace abandonment by farmers, and strategies to enhance the cultivation of landraces. Among other factors, maize diversity is linked with: (1) small-holder farming, (2) the production of traditional food products, (3) traditional cropping systems, (4) cultivation in marginal areas, and (5) retention of control over the production system by the farmers. On the other hand, genetic erosion is associated with substitution of landraces with hybrid varieties or cash crops, and partial (off-farm labor) or complete migration to urban areas. Continued cultivation, and therefore on-farm conservation of genetic diversity held in maize landraces, can be encouraged by creating or strengthening market opportunities that make the cultivation of landraces and open pollinated varieties (OPVs) more profitable for farmers, supporting breeding programs that prioritize improvement of landraces and their special traits, and increasing the access to quality germplasm of landraces and landrace-derived OPVs.

Mruma Roles Conceptualization, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft Affiliation: ACDI/VOCA, Feed the Future Tanzania NAFAKA II Activity, Iringa, Tanzania Abstract In this paper, the authors use survey data from over 800 households to examine the impact of demonstration plots and associated activities (distribution of small packs of agricultural inputs) on smallholder farmers’ decisions to buy agricultural inputs in Tanzania.

The main factors that limit the productivity of smallholder agriculture in the country include land degradation and poor soil fertility; climate variability; crop pests and diseases; low adoption of improved agronomic practices as a result of inadequate access to information and unreliable agro-input supply systems and institutional barriers such as poor markets for inputs and farm products; and poor farmer organization [3].

At the global level, in 2010, the United States government launched a hunger and food security initiative, Feed the Future (FtF), which is designed to harmonize regional hunger- and poverty-fighting efforts in countries with chronic food insecurity and insufficient production of staple crops.

The first phase of the activity (project) was commissioned in 2011 and ran through 2016 with a goal of sustainably reducing poverty and hunger by improving the productivity and competitiveness of maize and rice value chains that offer job and income opportunities for rural households in Tanzania [6].

T1  - Impact of Climate Change on Cotton Production in Bangladesh
AN  - 2477426345
AB  - Bangladesh produces only 5% of the cotton she needs to sustain her readymade garments industries. The country has very limited agricultural land and cotton competes with other crops for this scarce land resource. On top of that, Bangladesh is regarded as a country where agriculture is highly vulnerable to the variabilities of weather patterns that result from climate change. Against this backdrop, to better understand the potential for the sustainable expansion of cotton production in Bangladesh, we examine cotton’s agricultural value chain and projected climate risks associated with different phases of the chain. We identified associated stakeholders at different phases of cotton production, engaged with them to understand climatic and non-climatic threats and developed an integrated set of recommendations for climate-risk management through improving the connection of producers to markets, increasing economic returns to small farmers, and improving efficiency along the value chain. We discussed our estimated climate projections with stakeholders to understand the challenges at different stages of production and marketing, and together explored and identified probable solutions. This research offers a new and evolving approach to assess climate change impact on agriculture utilizing a holistic approach, which could be adopted for other crops.

T1  - Direct and spillover impacts of community-based seed production: Quasi-experimental evidence from Nepal
AN  - 2575744955
AB  - Maize production is central to rural livelihoods in the hills of Nepal. Access to affordable improved maize seed has long been a barrier to productivity gains and livelihood improvement. This study evaluates the direct and indirect (spillover) impacts of a community-based seed production program in Nepal using a quasi-experimental method for selected outcome indicators. Our results show that community-based seed production provides a significant positive direct impact on maize income and female leadership opportunities. The impacts were particularly favorable for disadvantaged households (HHs) from lower castes and HHs that owned less land. There is also strong evidence of spillover impacts on improved seed adoption, yield, and household maize self-sufficiency. Community-based seed production thereby could help Nepal attain cereal self-sufficiency and nutritional security as envisioned in the national agricultural development strategy and seed vision.

T1  - Are farmer producer companies ready to behave as business entities? Insights from the vegetable-based farmer companies in West Bengal, India
AN  - 2461413389
AB  - Farmer producer companies are seen as an institutional arrangement to provide market access and sustainable livelihood to small farmers. In India, more than 4,200 producer organizations were registered over the last 8–10 years to mobilize millions of farmers to enhance their income through collective action. However, most of these organizations are at an early stage of establishing themselves amidst several hurdles. This study attempted to understand the challenges faced by the farmer producer companies (a type of producer organization) with the help of primary data collected through interviews of the CEOs of 36 such companies in West Bengal, India. The study also analyzed the issues concerning developing a supply-chain by producer companies with institutional buyers based on a real-time experiment, which involved examining the process of supply of vegetables to a bulk purchaser. The study found a lack of trust and awareness among the farmers to be significant hurdles to form producer companies. Inadequate training, inept management, and poor organizational skills of the members challenge the functioning of such companies. Further, some of the inadequacies in the supply-chain of a producer company, as found in the experiment, can be improved by the coordinated use of technology, training, and planning.

T1  - Grain legume seed systems for smallholder farmers: Perspectives on successful innovations
AN  - 2456819400
AB  - Grain legumes are nutritionally important components of smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Unfortunately, limited access to quality seed of improved varieties at affordable prices due to inadequate seed systems has reduced their contribution to improving nutrition and reducing poverty in these regions. This paper analyses four seed systems case studies: chickpea in Ethiopia and Myanmar; cowpea in Nigeria; and tropical grain legumes in Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda highlighting outcomes, lessons learned, and the enabling factors which supported the successful innovations. All four case studies highlighted at least some of the following outcomes: increased adoption of improved varieties and area planted; increased productivity and income to farmers; improved market access and growth; and significant national economic benefits. Important lessons were learned including the value of small seed packets to reach many farmers; the value of innovative partnerships; capacity building of value chain actors; and continuity and coherence of funding through Tropical Legumes projects II and III and the recently funded Accelerated Varietal Improvement and Seed Delivery of Legumes and Cereals in Africa (AVISA) project. Successful adoption of innovations depends not just on the right technologies but also on the enabling environment. The case studies clearly showed that market demand was correctly identified, establishment of successful partners and institutional linkages overcame constraints in production and delivery of improved seed to smallholders, and fostered conducive policies supported national seed systems. All were integral to seed system viability and sustainability. It is hoped that these examples will provide potential models for future grain legume seed systems efforts. In addition, the analysis identified a number of areas that require further research.

T1  - Hemp: Can cooperative-run quotas prevent overproduction?
AN  - 2384187199
AB  - Hellwinckel examines the condition of the hemp industry following the legalization of hemp in the US. The legalization of hemp provides a new opportunity for small farmers in the country and coming on the heels of trade wars and depressed crop returns, the timing couldn't be better. However, while hemp production could support a decent living for these small farmers, production opportunities such as this will draw interest from producers of all sizes, which may determine its profitability. Hemp, just like any other crop, can be produced on a massive scale. The industrial system stands at the ready with machines, inputs, land-grant agricultural research universities, transportation systems, markets, and capital to plant hemp on large acreages and then process, market, and deliver it to consumers. Once unleashed, the vast majority of the crop could be grown on large acreages under industrial management, mechanized, and with few people on the land. Organic hemp could be another option offered by the industrial model, but could be equally mechanized. Within five to 10 years, any current profit advantage of hemp to farmers could diminish to the low level of market returns offered by other industrial crops like corn or beans.

T1  - Measurement of President Reputation of Farmers’ Specialized Cooperatives Based on Factor Analysis
AN  - 2556432576
AB  - As the most important carrier to solve the contradiction between “small farmers” and “big markets”, cooperatives play an important role in the development of rural economy. As the soul of the cooperative, the president’s reputation is crucial to the development of the cooperative. On the basis of stakeholder theory and role theory, this paper constructs a measurement model with 35 indicators including 8 aspects: leader role, benefit spokesperson, team worker, ethical model, mobilization motivator, innovator, social contributor, relationship coordinator, etc. Through sorting out and analyzing the first-hand survey data of 39 farmers’ professional cooperatives in Sichuan Province, the three most important dimensions was obtained that affect the reputation of the president: leader role, ethical model and mobilization motivator. Finally, the targeted cultivation measures for the president’s reputation were put forward.

AN  - 2468555820
AB  - This article examines the pig value chain in the Kassena Nankana East District of Ghana using data from 108 pig value chain actors. The empirical results revealed that the pig value chain actors added a considerable amount of value, of which processors added the highest value. Processors were perceived to be the most important actors in the governance of the value chain with respect to profit and bargaining power, whereas the producers governed the value chain in terms of information concentration and protection from competition. The results have key policy implications for the production and marketing of pigs in Ghana.

T1  - Marketing efficiency and determinants of marketing channel choice by rice farmers in rural Tanzania: Evidence from Mbeya region, Tanzania
AN  - 2450954278
AB  - Rice production is an increasing source of income and food security for smallholder farmers in many parts of Tanzania. Improving market access for rice farmers is essential to raise rural incomes and reduce poverty. This paper aims to determine the most efficient rice marketing channel and analyse the factors affecting marketing channel choices by smallholder rice farmers. Marketing efficiency was tested using Acharya and Aggarwal's composite index method. A multinomial logit model was used to analyse the marketing channel choices. The results showed that the miller–wholesaler marketing channel is the most efficient. The results show that most farmers in rural areas still sell their rice to local collectors because of failure, fear or inability by farmers to venture out of the farm gate into the markets. The findings suggest that there is a need to improve rural infrastructure, market information systems, smallholder access to productive assets, prudent use of credit and strengthening collective action through well‐organised farmer groups in the country.

T1  - Opportunities and constraints for adoption of maize-legume mixed cropping systems in Laos
AN  - 2443827000
AB  - Land use and land cover have rapidly changed in Kham basin, northern Laos, with a rapid expansion of maize cultivated area. While maize monoculture has contributed to reduce rural poverty, many farmers are now confronted to declining yields, indebtedness, rising health and environmental concerns. Interventions at two different stages of the maize boom, i.e. expansion-intensification and distress-diversification phases, allowed capturing the main drivers of change in maize production systems, and assessing opportunities and constraints for the adoption of more sustainable maize-legume mixed systems. The successive innovations in maize cropping systems, i.e. introduction of hybrid seeds, motorized tillage, herbicides, service provision, planters, and mineral fertilizers, were mainly driven by productivity and profitability objectives. Farmers’ interest in maize-legume mixed systems was low during maize expansion-intensification phase. The decline in maize profitability and new market outlets for legumes open new opportunity windows for maize-legume mixed systems. Yet, farmers’ adoption of such systems is limited by (i) local perceptions of legumes as cash crops only, and (ii) farmers’ least effort strategies that includes e.g. heavy herbicide use and livestock free roaming after maize harvest. Large-scale adoption of maize-legume mixed systems requires innovative intervention mechanisms to engage local stakeholders into redesigning their landscapes and value-chains.

T1  - Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation of participation in collective actions and adoption of climate-smart farming technologies in South–West Nigeria
AN  - 2561655554
AB  - Enhancing sustainable food security requires agricultural production systems to change in the direction of higher productivity and to mitigate lower output variability in the face of climate extreme related hazards such as land degradation. Adoption of resilient food production system capable of withstanding disruptive events is therefore needed to stabilize farmers’ productivity. Consequently, participation in collective actions has been touted as an effective approach to enhance cooperation among individuals within a social system and to advance adoption of climate-smart farming techniques (conservation agriculture). This study investigated this perspective using heterogeneous treatment effects estimation to analyze the data collected from 350 smallholder farmers selected randomly from the South–West Nigeria. The average treatment effects on the treated estimate revealed that participation in collective actions had adoption-increasing effect for each unit variation in propensity score rank, although, negative selection effect was suspected. Similarly, information acquisition, access to extension service and frequency of visit by extension workers are significant features that predict adoption in the study area. However, rosenbaum sensitivity analysis test revealed that the increasing effect of participation in collective actions on conservation agriculture adoption is insensitive to unobserved bias that may double or triple the odds of exposure to treatment. Hence, the average treatment effect on the treated estimate is a pure impact of the participation in collective actions. The study concluded that farmers with high propensity to participate in collective action have high likelihood to adopt climate-resilient farming practices compared to the counterparts with a lower propensity of participation in collective action.

T1  - Combining participatory games and backcasting to support collective scenario evaluation: an action research approach for sustainable agroforestry landscape management
AN  - 2434616628
AB  - The combined and interacting effects of land-use change, resource extraction and climate change threaten the sustainability of millions of mainly smallholder farms in tropical agroforested landscapes. In many of these landscapes, coordinated action among stakeholders at landscape level would help to address challenges such as pests and diseases, price crises and climate change. However, methods to facilitate the co-production of sustainable landscape management in such complex multi-stakeholder systems are currently largely lacking. In this paper, we present a novel approach to explore pathways for the sustainability transition of agroforestry systems. By combining participatory forecasting and backcasting approaches, based on serious games and future vision development, we explore relevant agroforestry management strategies for reaching sustainable future coffee-based agroforestry landscapes. We focused our research on the challenges faced in the main coffee-producing area in Nicaragua. Here, we organized five participatory game sessions to explore farmer decision-making processes, farming strategies and to develop new networks and stimulate social learning among farmers. In the associated backcasting workshop, the most influential game session participants joined technicians, researchers and municipality officials to collectively envision sustainable future landscape management. In all game sessions, farmers developed diversified coffee-based agroforested landscapes characterised by increased density and diversity of shade trees, for the purpose of income diversification as well as forest conservation. During the backcasting workshop, the participants identified policy instruments and community-based solutions for the transition to sustainable landscapes. Our participatory approach facilitated discussion on landscape planning among farmers and other stakeholders and allowed the outline of a pathway towards the collective envisioned future landscape. The combination of participatory forecasting and backcasting proved to be a helpful tool to support multi-stakeholder processes towards sustainable landscape management in this and other complex landscapes.

T1  - Contract farming and rice production efficiency in Ghana
TT  - Contract farming in Ghana
AN  - 2424663122
AB  - PurposeEven though many studies identify positive effects of contract farming (CF) on the livelihood of farmers, the use of CF as a tool to increase farm performance is unsettled debate. Information on CF is relatively not available in staple food chains. Theoretical considerations have shown that there are challenges in employing CF in staple food chains such as rice. With the increasing trend of rice CF in Ghana, it is very critical to establish its performance in rice production in Ghana. It is therefore imperative to analyse the impact of CF on the performance of smallholder rice farmers.Design/methodology/approachA survey was conducted where 350 rice farmers selected through a stratified sampling technique using structured questionnaires were interviewed. Descriptive and inferential statistics including stochastic frontier analyses and endogenous treatment effect regression were used to analyse the data.FindingsThe results from the endogenous treatment effect regression model show that CF improves rice farmers' technical, allocative and economic efficiencies by 21, 23 and 26%, respectively. Farm size and CF were identified as common factors influencing technical, allocative and economic efficiency measures of the farmers positively. It further identified age of farmer, educational level and household labour as factors influencing farmers' participation in CF positively.Research limitations/implicationsIt is recommended that CF is a good tool to enhance rice production efficiency, and hence, farmers should be encouraged to participate in CF as strategy to enhance the local rice production in Ghana.Social implicationsThe outcome of this study has the potential to influence rice production in the country. The country is a net importer of rice and just about 35% self-sufficient in rice production.Originality/valueThis study is the first to assess performance of CF in rice crop production in Ghana and also one of the few to use efficiency as a performance measure.

T1  - Forest commons, vertical integration and smallholder's saving and investment responses: Evidence from a quasi-experiment
AN  - 2446722752
AB  - As the result of prohibitively high transaction costs, smallholder farmers are only partly integrated into agricultural and forest commodity markets, a situation that may leave them in a lower level of development equilibrium (i.e., a poverty trap). For the most part, many users of forest commons extract forest products, typically non-timber products, for subsistence use or safety net purposes. To overcome this problem, in recent years, collective vertical integration (VI) of forest product marketing cooperative structures have been promoted and, in some cases, adopted by users of forest commons. Although this type of program has been observed to raise smallholder incomes, there is little evidence available on saving/investment responses to such income gains. This paper investigates precautionary saving and investment responses to collective forest product marketing programs among users of forest commons in Ethiopian villages. To identify the causal effects of the program, I applied propensity score matching, difference-in-difference (DID) and change-in-change (CIC) estimators to household survey data collected from randomly selected households in the Gimbo district (south-western Ethiopia). I find strong evidence that participation in the program reduces savings in the form of livestock holdings and that effect is limited to non-poor households. When interpreted in terms of the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH), the results imply that participants felt the current income gains to be non-transient, which led to reduced precautionary savings and to a gain in consumption/welfare. Moreover, I found that the program has spurred investment in child education and participation in off-farm self-employment. These results point to the importance of the safety net/insurance channel of the program. Overall, the findings underscore the program's potential to raise the standard of living via ancillary mechanisms beyond directly raising income outcome.

T1  - Market participation, household food security, and income: The case of cowpea producers in northern Nigeria
AN  - 2436896711
AB  - This article evaluates the impact of cowpea market participation on household food security and income in northern Nigeria. Using household survey data from a representative sample of over 1,500 farm households and applying a combination of instrumental variable techniques and dose–response functions, we found that cowpea market participation had a statistically significant positive impact on household food security and income. Cowpea market participation increased food expenditure by 1.6% and household income by 0.7% with a 10 unit increase in the quantity of cowpea sold. These results underscore the importance of cowpea market participation for household food security and income improvement. We also found that selling cowpea to rural and urban traders significantly increased household income, food expenditure, and food security. Results show that selling cowpea to rural and urban traders increased household income by 17% and 13%, respectively. The results point to the need for an enabling policy environment and public infrastructure to enhance market participation of farmers and traders. Public infrastructure investments in the form of feeder road construction and maintenance in the distant villages are encouraged, which in the long run can translate into improved cowpea productivity and welfare of smallholder farmers.

T1  - Underutilized African indigenous fruit trees and food–nutrition security: Opportunities, challenges, and prospects
AN  - 2436896645
AB  - The diverse range of indigenous fruit trees in Africa is a source of untapped potential for food and nutrition security. Here, we review information on 10 indigenous fruit trees that are considered to be underutilized and explore their occurrence, distribution, nutritional components, phytochemicals, and medicinal potentials, as well as their associated challenges and prospects. The indigenous fruit trees, which occur across different ecological zones in Africa, are rich sources of vitamins, minerals, protein, and valuable phytochemicals. They also have recognized medicinal value and used as diverse therapeutic remedies by many ethnic groups in Africa. The key challenges to fruit tree sustainability include indiscriminate and illegal logging, low accessibility, and low acceptability, as well as inadequate research on their cultivation. We proposed a scheme to increase the value chain of underutilized fruit trees, which can contribute to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and other stakeholders mainly through income generation. In addition to the concerted efforts of multidisciplinary research teams encompassing plant breeders, botanists, molecular biologists, food scientists, and horticulturists, there is an urgent need for governments and other international stakeholders to provide incentives and encourage the domestication, commercialization, and agro‐processing of underutilized fruit trees for future economic prosperity of Africa.

T1  - A review of inclusive business models and their application in aquaculture development
AN  - 2435221720
AB  - For aquaculture to continue along its current growth trajectory and contribute towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, value chains must become more inclusive. Smallholders and other local value chain actors are often constrained by circumstances and market failures in the global aquaculture industry. Integrating these actors into aquaculture value chains through inclusive business models (IBMs) is often touted as a solution to sustainable and ethical trade and business that can generate development outcomes. We reviewed 36 papers under seven business models commonly used in agriculture development to assess their application in aquaculture value chains in lower‐income countries. A global value chain (GVC) analysis is used to unpack the economic and social upgrading objectives of the different IBMs, as well as the types of relational coordination used between actors in the chain to achieve development outcomes. The extent to which these IBMs helped poor actors overcome certain barriers is evaluated with a focus on how they may ensure or be a risk to inclusiveness through the relations and upgrading opportunities evident in their make‐up. The analysis found that the majority of the models focused on economic upgrading over social upgrading. Providing opportunities for the latter is key to achieving the inclusive objectives of IBMs. Greater horizontal coordination between actors can create further opportunities for economic upgrading established under vertical coordination with other nodes upstream and downstream in a value chain. There is a need to further contextualize these models to aquaculture systems and develop clear indicators of inclusiveness.

T1  - Tomato food value chain: managing postharvest losses in Cameroon
AN  - 2556135290
AB  - Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) production contributes to food and nutrition security, and a lucrative business for many stakeholders. Major stakeholders in the tomato food value chain (TFVC) include farmers, middlemen, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers. Farmers contribute the highest in value addition of tomato but earn the lowest profit (8.8%) compared to retailers (53.0%) with the highest, while middlemen and wholesalers earn 19.2% and 19.9%, respectively. This review is aimed at improving TFVC in Fako Division, South West Region of Cameroon, by evaluating the causes of tomato postharvest losses (PHL) and proposing suitable innovative solutions and policies adapted from existing strategies across the globe. Smallholder farmers incur a lot of PHL of tomato due to mechanical injury from the use of raffia made baskets, overfilled basket, poor transportation and logistics facilities, and harvest maturity index. Perforated plastic crates could be used to reduce losses. The government of Cameroon needs to provide a legal framework on tomato marketing to help regulate the actions of the various actors in order to redistribute profit as per the value added by each actor. Management of PHL is a collective effort of all stakeholders working together to provide high quality and quantity of tomato fruits.

T1  - Determinants of smallholder farmers’ access to microfinance credits: A case study in Sassandra-Marahoué District, Côte d’Ivoire
TT  - Microfinance credits
AN  - 2498985845
AB  - PurposeSeveral years after the regularization of microfinance activity in Côte d’Ivoire, smallholder farmers’ access to microfinance credits still remains marginal. The purpose of this paper is to identify and analyze key determinants of access to microfinance credit in Sassandra-Marahoué District.Design/methodology/approachA total of 150 smallholder farmers were randomly sampled using an interview guide and semi-structured questionnaires. Univariate statistics and Probit binary modeling were employed for data analyses.FindingsResults revealed that socio-economic/demographic characteristics of smallholder farmers and credit requirements imposed by microfinance institutions (MFIs) are key determinants of smallholder farmers’ access to microfinance credits in the district.Research limitations/implicationsAlthough, the authors shed light on the determinants of microfinance credit access for smallholder farmers in this district, the study focused on a single source of financial credit. Future research will need to explore the determinants of credit demand and the choice between different sources of rural credits in Côte d’Ivoire.Practical implicationsThe findings suggest that MFIs seldom take into account smallholder farmers who are not engaged in off-farm income-generating activities and savings account; and those with low level of education. Sensitization programs on the importance of savings mobilization and credit policy by MFIs will potentially increase smallholder’s knowledge on credit access requirements and thereby increased access.Originality/valueTo the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study investigating determinants of smallholder farmers’ access to microfinance credits in Côte d’Ivoire specifically in the Sassandra-Marahoué District. The results of this study will serve as a guide for MFIs for improving smallholder farmers’ access to credit.

T1  - Factors affecting the performance of Tshiombo Irrigation Scheme in Limpopo Province, South Africa
AN  - 2472333840
AB  - Smallholder irrigation farming is valuable for im-proving the welfare of rural communities in South Africa. Irrigation schemes in South Africa perform below average as some have collapsed. Boosting performance of irrigation schemes will ensure economic sustainability for low-income earners. There is little scholarly literature on factors affect-ing performance of smallholder irrigation schemes in South Africa. Therefore, this study assessed factors affecting yield and gross margin of sweet potato in the Tshiombo Irrigation Scheme. Data was collected using structured questionnaires, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. The perfor-mance of the irrigation scheme was analysed using the ordi-nary least square method. The yield or gross margin of sweet potatoes were used as proxies for the scheme performance. Six estimators, namely age of farmers (–0.022), labour avail-ability (–0.185), cultivated area (–0.130), pesticide subsidy (0.138), market price (6.090), and distance of the plot from the main canal (0.191) significantly impacted performance of the scheme. A minimum participation of farmers in the value chain exposed them to lower market prices. The gross margin was generally low due to limited participation of aging farm-ers in the value chain. The performance of the scheme can be improved through providing and ensuring competitive prices and encouraging youth to participate in the scheme farming by providing lucrative market prices.

T1  - SUPPLY AND PERFORMANCE OF COFFEE MARKETS IN GOLOLCHA DISTRICT OF OROMIA REGION, ETHIOPIA
AN  - 2462495731
AB  - The objectives of the study were to identify performance of coffee market and factors affecting market supply of coffee by smallholder farmers. The data was collected through personal interviews from a total of 213 respondents. The result of Focus Group Discussion revealed coffee producers in the study area are exposed to low and volatile price. Based on two stage least squares model, we found that amount of coffee produced, sex of the household heads, educational level, family size, land allocated to coffee production and access to market information had positively and significantly influenced amount of coffee supplied to the market. Therefore, emphasis should be given on controlling illegal traders and enhancing market infrastructure, promotion of cooperatives, increasing level of coffee production and expansion of education facilities in the study area.

T1  - Designating tree crops as forest: Land competition and livelihood effects mediate tree crops impact on natural forest cover in south China
AN  - 2446723806
AB  - The Chinese government applies the term 'tree crops' (jingjilin) to a bundle of tree species with uses other than timber production, defining this category as a component of national forest statistics. Tree crops may displace either farmland or forestland, and can be a promising livelihood option for smallholders. The overall impact of this particular policy on natural forest growth remained unanswered. In the general expansion trend of tree cover in southern China, tree crops could compete for land with natural forests, their cultivation may pose environmental trade-offs with natural forest cover. However, in a context of large labor flows from countryside to cities, tree crops could provide promising opportunities for dealing with on-farm labor shortages and generating income for disadvantaged populations remaining in rural communities, then promoting remaining natural forest quality through alternative livelihoods process. There is a knowledge gap to thoroughly investigate tree crops' impact on natural forest change both conceptually and empirically, especially a mechanism verification of the alternative livelihood hypothesis. Thus, we construct a framework assessing land use competition and alternative livelihood effects together to assess overall impacts of tree crop cultivation on natural forests. Our dataset combines forest resource inventory data and provincial social-economic factors for a panel analysis of contributions to change in natural forest cover, density, and stock in China's biodiversity-rich southern provinces. Results show tree crop cover is negatively associated with natural forest extent, but positive associated with change in natural forest density, while the relationship with change in natural forest stock is insignificant. Further tests of mechanisms support the hypothesis that tree crops benefit disadvantaged rural populations, providing an alternative livelihood. Defining tree crops as forest in China obscures important patterns, particularly a trade-off between tree crops and natural forest cover and a possible synergy with natural forest density mediated by alternative livelihood processes. Policy makers should enact specific policies to incentivize natural forest recovery in the southern collective forest zone and reconsider the appropriateness of defining tree crops as forest. Concentration and intensification of tree crop production on suitable lands may have the potential to benefit both forests and impoverished populations.

T1  - Determinants of Market Participation among Smallholder Mango Producers in Assosa Zone of Benishangul Gumuz Region in Ethiopia
AN  - 2434474645
AB  - Commercial transformation of smallholder agriculture entails production decisions based on market signals and significant participation in output markets. Consequently, this research attempts to contribute to the understanding of smallholder commercialization of mango production and analyzing factors determining the extent of smallholders’ participation in output market. The study was based on the cross-sectional data collected from 150 sample households which were randomly selected from 6 rural kebeles. Both descriptive statistics and econometric analysis were used to identify and analyze factors that determine the extent of smallholders’ participation in output market. Accordingly, out of the included 16 variables, 10 were found to significantly influence the quantity of mango sold. The Tobit truncated regression model results showed that the determinant of mango volume of sale includes resources ownership (land allocated for mango and land fragmentation), households assets ownership (number of productive mango trees and mango seedling availability), access to institutions (farmers club membership), social-network (critical support from non-relatives within the village and brokers), and economic (previous income from mango sale, Income from livestock sale, and mango market price) are the significant determinants of mango market participation. Given the current high market demand for Assosa mango, there is a room to enhance the level of mango commercialization, thereby enhancing mango market participation. To improve quantity of mango sold policies and development, endeavors must target at improving household resource endowment, creating market linkage and synergy among mango value-chain actors, and strengthening the existing mango nursery sites and infra-structure.

T1  - Governing sustainable palm oil supply: Disconnects, complementarities, and antagonisms between state regulations and private standards
AN  - 2419198230
AB  - The global palm oil value chain has grown in complexity; stakeholder relationships and linkages are increasingly shaped by new public and private standards that aim to ameliorate social and environmental costs while harnessing economic gains. Regulatory initiatives in the emerging policy regime complex struggle to resolve sector‐wide structural performance issues: pervasive land conflicts, yield differences between companies and smallholders, and carbon emissions arising from deforestation and peatland conversion. Identifying opportunities for more effective governance of the palm oil value chain and supply landscapes, this paper explores disconnects, complementarities, and antagonisms between public regulations and private standards, looking at the global, national, and subnational policy domains shaping chain actors’ conduct. Greater complementarities have emerged among transnational instruments, but state regulation disconnects persist and antagonisms prevail between national state regulations and transnational private standards. Emerging experimental approaches, particularly at subnational level, aim to improve coordination to both enhance complementarities and resolve disconnects.

T1  - Vertical farming: tin mining and <i>agro-mineros</i> in Bolivia
AN  - 2417834673
AB  - Throughout Bolivia, collectives of small-scale miners known as ‘mining cooperatives’ have developed a reputation for cutthroat extractive practices that were shaped by neoliberal restructuring starting in the 1980s. Charting a history that starts at the turn of the twentieth century, this paper argues that cooperative mining in the tin belt of Northern Potosí has emerged as a vertical instantiation of small-holder farming practices that migrated, along with miners themselves, from surrounding indigenous ayllus. In the subterranean, however, these practices interacted with the legacies of tin mining, which was characterized by labor hierarchies that corresponded with vertical variation in ore quality. New social striations crystallized as small-holder farming customs settled into the subterranean structure, creating sharp social differentiation across these subsoil ‘family farms.’ The class composition of mining cooperatives at the national level has been shaped by these entangled underground histories, with implications for the country’s economic and environmental futures.

T1  - SUPPLY-SIDE ANALYSIS OF THE MARKET FOR TOMATO IN BAUCHI STATE, NIGERIA
AN  - 2315490460
AB  - The benefits of tomato to human health among the vegetable family cannot be overemphasized. Tomatoes are grown for home consumption in the backyard of many households across sub-Saharan Africa. They are important sources of vitamins as well as essential cash crop for both smallholders and medium-scale commercial farmers. A number of studies have shown that tomato is grown in commercial quantity anywhere agronomic conditions allow. In Nigeria and many countries of the world, tomato has become one of the most important crops in agriculture for smallholder farmers both for processing and fresh market. This paper analyses the supply side of the market for tomato in Bauchi State, Nigeria. The data employed were purposively obtained from farmers, wholesalers and retailers from agricultural areas in 7 Local Government Areas of Bauchi State. These include Bauchi, Alkaleri, Toro, Kari, Shira, Darazo, and Ganjuwa. Analysis is mainly predicated on the weighted least squares regression in order to address the problems that may arise from having heteroskedastic errors in the models. The findings show that farm characteristics majorly affect supply of tomatoes while handling costs and cooperative membership are mainly responsible for loss of tomatoes across the marketing chain. Also, cooperative membership does not play a significant role in improving the situations of neither the farmers nor the middlemen in terms of increased profitability and supply. In addition, socioeconomic and farm characteristics are found to be key factors affecting tomatoes' profitability. Therefore, farmers should be encouraged to embrace a competitive market setting in order to achieve a free flow market interaction in the determination of price. A favourable farm-land ownership and acquisition policy should be made by government in order to increase output of tomatoes and consequently, higher profitability. This is most likely to have a positive influence on employment generation as more rural populace would be engaged in the production of farm products. Besides, infrastructural development, specifically in the area of transportations needs to be enhanced by the government in order to ease movement of agricultural produce from the point of harvest to their final destinations. Attention should also be given to government investment in storage facilities to minimize the spoilage level of farm produce in Nigeria. Farm cooperatives should be reformed so as to promote profitability of the agricultural firms.

T1  - Exploring the farmer productive behavior of cassava in effort of developing value-chain linkages to improve smallholder cassava production systems in North Sumatera, Indonesia
AN  - 2555986369
AB  - Cassava farming in North Sumatera is prominently for cash crops as feedstock to the tapioca starch factory. Multiple stakeholder engagement is needed to develop the value chain linkage to improve the smallholder cassava production system in North Sumatera. The project activity started in 2018 to improve the cassava farming system by introduced new cassava varieties, training on soil and fertilizer management, and linkage between multiple stakeholders to support the smallholder cassava farming. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and household surveys were conducted in 2019 to evaluate the changes in farmers’ behavior and perspective toward the improvement of the farming system. The results showed that most of the farmers had improved their farming system, and consequently, the cassava tuber yield than in turn, increased the tapioca starch company productivity. However, several issues need to be solved in order to effectively upscaling the smallholder cassava farming in the region.

T1  - Social networks, rice value chain participation and market performance of smallholder farmers in Ghana
AN  - 2501857529
AB  - This paper examines the impact of rice value chain participation and social networks on smallholder farmers' market performance outcomes (paddy price, quantity of paddy traded, and net returns), using data from a recent survey of 458 smallholder rice farmers in northern Ghana. We employed a treatment effects model to account for potential selection bias associated with observable and unobservable factors. The empirical results reveal that smallholder farmers' participation in a rice value chain is associated with increased paddy price, quantity traded, and net returns. We also find that value chain participation decisions and market performance are positively and significantly influenced by social networks. The empirical results also suggest that sex, farm size, mobile phone ownership, and access to credit significantly increase paddy prices, quantity traded, and net returns of smallholder rice farmers in the value chain.

T1  - From cradle to chain? Gendered struggles for cassava commercialisation in Mozambique
AN  - 2430976103
AB  - This article draws on survey data, interviews and archival research to analyse women's mixed responses to a cassava commercialisation scheme in Zavala district, Mozambique. As an example of the “Green Revolution for Africa” (GR4A) approach to development, which holds that women farmers’ participation in “value chains” will reduce rural poverty and hunger, this initiative seeks to transform cassava from a food staple into raw material for cassava-based commercial beer. The study evaluates the contradictory claims and outcomes of the GR4A model, as the bumpy roll-out of the value chain in Zavala reveals the risks of overlooking the historical context and gendered knowledge in neoliberal development interventions.Alternate abstract:Cet article s’appuie sur des données d’enquête, des entretiens et des recherches dans les archives pour analyser les réponses mitigées des femmes à un programme de commercialisation du manioc dans le district de Zavala, au Mozambique. Comme exemple de l'approche de développement « Révolution verte pour l'Afrique » (GR4A), selon laquelle la participation des agricultrices à des « chaînes de valeur » doit réduire la pauvreté et la faim en milieu rural, cette initiative vise à convertir le manioc d'un aliment de base à une matière première pour la production commerciale de la bière. L'étude évalue les prétentions et les résultats contradictoires du modèle GR4A, et illustre par la description de la mise en place chaotique de la chaîne de valeur à Zavala les risques de négliger le contexte historique et les connaissances différenciées selon le sexe dans le cadre d’interventions de développement néolibérales.

T1  - Gender relations along the maize value chain in Mozambique
AN  - 2429435733
AB  - This article offers insights into gender relations at every node of the maize value chain in rural Mozambique. Data were collected using mixed methods, including a survey of 295 households, key informant interviews with 29 individuals (breeders, agro-dealers, traders, and processors), and 12 sex-disaggregated focus group discussions with smallholder farmers. The findings show that in terms of the gender division of labor in maize production, there is no significant difference between male-headed and female-headed households concerning the participation of men, women, children, and hired labor. In addition, due to their culturally prescribed role as head of household, men are responsible for maize marketing and for making decisions both at the farm level and across the higher nodes of the value chain. Moreover, cultural restrictions on women’s mobility and gender disparities in access to transportation tend to exclude women from participating in the markets. However, women from matrilineal villages are shown to have more autonomy than those from patrilineal villages in making decisions about the quantity of maize to sell, participation in the market, and control of revenue. Finally, whether the woman belongs to the patriarchal or matriarchal system, she still faces challenges as she accedes to the higher nodes of the value chain, for example, participating as a trader, because of her dual roles as mother/homemaker and business woman.

T1  - ICT Application in Transforming Agricultural Extension Information Service Delivery in Tana River County, Kenya
AN  - 2427315711
AB  - Agricultural Extension includes dissemination of information on farming to farmers in order to help them improve agricultural productivity. A premise exists that if extension programmes are well planned and delivered, they will enhance farming efficiency and output by providing farmers with agricultural information that will help them to utilize their limited production resources. This paper examines how ICT application could help transform public extension service delivery and improve the skills of public agricultural extension service providers and in so doing increase small farmers' access to agricultural information. This study is set in the Tana River County in Kenya, considered agricultural sector growth and development as vital to the County's economic stability and community progress. However, while determined efforts in uplifting extension, and firming up their linkage with other actors in agricultural value chains were recognized as important to the future of agricultural development in the county, there is still a lack of evidence of a clear relationship between agricultural productivity and extension services. There was also no clear evidence that small farmers in the county were receiving sufficient extension services to sustainably undertake farming for improved productivity and food safety. While the application of ICTs in agricultural extension was found to be limited, the research acknowledged its important role in facilitating access to agricultural information by providing farmers with timely and relevant agricultural information. The study considered the necessary requirements for setting up an effective agricultural extension information system and it is assumed that this will add credibility to the policy agenda for agricultural extension and communication for rural development.

T1  - Impacts of improved sorghum varieties intensification on household welfare in the mid-Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe
AN  - 2415062062
AB  - Attaining food and income security is a persistent challenge among small holder farmers of Southern Africa. Improved sorghum varieties are widely regarded as a panacea to extreme poverty. The paper uses endogenous switching regression to determine impacts of improved sorghum varieties intensification on household welfare. Household dietary diversity score and household food insecurity access score were used as outcome variables and proxies for food security. Cross-sectional data were generated in the Mid Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe in 2016 from 380 households in a survey conducted with five purposively selected wards. Social association groups, average weighted market prices, household income, age of principal decision maker, dependency ratio, ownership of draught power and storage facilities have significant (p < 0.01) implications on the adoption decision. Counterfactual analyses shows that farmers who allocate more land towards improved sorghum varieties are relatively better off in food diversity and food access. Intensifying improved sorghum varieties can increase dietary diversity by 35% while reducing food insecurity by 29–34%. Social networking can be strengthened through local, government and private partnerships to facilitate generation and efficient dissemination of sorghum production and marketing information. Improving the market prices can increase market size and enhance efficiency along strategic value chain nodes.

T1  - Which type of producer organization is (more) inclusive? Dynamics of farmers’ membership and participation in the decision‐making process: Annales de l'economie Collective
AN  - 2401612593
AB  - Producer organizations (POs) provide benefits to smallholders by alleviating market access challenges. However, whether all farmers benefit from a PO is still a question. Limited evidence is available on whether POs are inclusive of poor farmers. Even if the poor join, do they participate in decision‐making? We conducted interviews with 595 smallholder dairy farmers in Kenya. We distinguish three groups; members of a bargaining PO, members of a processing PO and non‐members. We show that membership is related to the structural characteristics of the organization: processing POs favor membership of farmers that are wealthier, more educated and more innovative. As to participation in the decision‐making process: older, male and specialized farmers have a higher chance of being involved than poor farmers. Factors distinguishing farmer participation in decision‐making between bargaining and processing POs are highlighted. We find that a bargaining PO is more inclusive of all groups of farmers, while women and poor farmers are excluded from decision‐making in a processing PO. Our findings contribute to policymaking on inclusive development.

T1  - Mobilising common biocultural heritage for the socioeconomic inclusion of small farmers: panarchy of two case studies on quinoa in Chile and Bolivia
AN  - 2395451737
AB  - Valorising the biocultural heritage of common goods could enable peasant farmers to achieve socially and economically inclusive sustainability. Increasingly appreciated by consumers, peasant heritage products offer small farmers promising opportunities for economic, social and territorial development. Identifying the obstacles and levers of this complex, multi-scale and multi-stakeholder objective requires an integrative framework. We applied the panarchy conceptual framework to two cases of participatory research with small quinoa producers: a local fair in Chile and quinoa export production in Bolivia. In both cases, the “commoning” process was crucial both to bring stakeholders together inside their communities and to gain outside recognition for their production and thus achieve social and economic inclusion. Despite the differences in scale, the local fair and the export market shared a similar marketing strategy based on short value chains promoting quality products with high identity value. In these dynamics of biocultural heritage valorisation, the panarchical approach revealed the central place as well as the vulnerability of the community territory. As a place of both anchoring and opening, the community territory is the privileged space where autonomous and consensual control over the governance of common biocultural resources can be exercised.

T1  - Social Investment and Smallholder Coca Cultivation in Colombia
AN  - 2392320833
AB  - Colombia is the largest supplier of coca leaf in the world, and fields smaller than one-hectare account for more than 60 per cent of cultivation. Despite the obvious relevance of smallholding growers to the strategies to control illicit crops, there are few insights into what motivates these smallholders to cultivate coca. We analyse the motivations of coca growers by estimating a discrete choice model including head of household characteristics, household variables, and agricultural unit attributes. We found that extremely poor farmers are more likely to grow coca than non-poor farmers in the same area, while households connected to the energy grid, with access to credit, and receiving cash payments for their licit crops, are less likely to grow coca crops. Our results suggest that strategies aiming to discourage farmers from growing coca should: 1) target specifically the poorest households in the region and not just seek to improve general living conditions, 2) expand rural electrification, and 3) enhance legal productivity by providing access to credit, technical support, and/or contracts on harvests before planting.

T1  - How Effective is Multiple Certification in Improving the Economic Conditions of Smallholder Farmers? Evidence from an Impact Evaluation in Colombia’s Coffee Belt
AN  - 2392320424
AB  - Voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) in the coffee sector have become a popular tool to improve the livelihoods of smallholder coffee farmers. As third-party and company-led VSS have proliferated, an increasing number of producer groups are turning toward multiple certification to diversify their export channels. Yet, each certification requires added efforts and expenses, both at the farm and the organisational level. Hence, it is important to evaluate the additionality of multiple certification in bringing benefits to smallholders’ farm economy. This study addresses this research gap using a sample of over 600 coffee farmers from two Fairtrade-certified cooperatives in Colombia’s coffee belt to assess the additional economic impact of Starbucks C.A.F.E. Practices, Nespresso AAA, 4C, and the combination of Rainforest Alliance/Nespresso AAA certification. In examining coffee gross profit and household income, we find limited gains from the addition of industry and company-led standards to the Fairtrade certification. Evaluating pathways to improved economic performance, gross profit improvements appear most likely if higher average prices are combined with lower production costs. Finally, we show that the majority of farmers are unable to break even, irrespective of their certification status. This alarming result illustrates the need for further intervention in the coffee value chain.

T1  - Motivation and barriers to access to formal credit of primary cinnamon producers from the perspective of value chain development in Northwestern Vietnam
TT  - Value chain development
AN  - 2533889449
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate borrowing motivation, credit access barriers and their impacts on income of smallholder farmers engaging in cinnamon value chain development in Northwestern Vietnam.Design/methodology/approachA multistage sampling technique using a structural questionnaire and in-depth interviews was applied for collecting primary data from farmers and relevant stakeholders. The Propensity Score Matching was employed to analyze access barriers and examine whether relaxing these barriers can improve farmer income. To deal with the issue of model uncertainty and further increase the robustness of results, Bayesian model average and the bootstrapping approach were applied.FindingsTo fulfill the certain quality standards of cinnamon products which are later used in the medicinal and food industry, farmers as primary producers need credit for intensive investment to increase the value of their products. Still, there are 25.36 percent of farmers who have access constraints to formal credit. In the credit received group, 24.56 percent have not received full credit as demanded. Access problems are relevant to lack of collateral, lack of bank account holdings, inconvenient access to roads, weak chain linkage and limited organic farming. Removing credit access barriers can improve the income for farmers from cinnamon farming activities.Research limitations/implicationsMore detailed information on the conditions under which credit serves a more important role in creating value addition for cinnamon products can help the government establish more effective credit policies.Social implicationsGreat attention should be paid to smallholder farmers as primary producers in the chain for sustainable value chain development in developing and emerging economies. Policy interventions should facilitate access to bank accounts, speed up the process of granting residential land use certificates, certify organic farming and upgrade the road system. Strengthening the chain linkage can enhance smallholder farmers’ capacity to obtain credit through value chain lending development.Originality/valueEmpirical studies on agricultural credit from the perspective of value chain development remain scarce. A better understanding of credit access constraints allows for the positing of recommendations for policy makers to facilitate value chain lending and a medicinal plant-based agro-forestry system in similar situations.

T1  - Analysis of cassava value chain in Ghana: implications for upgrading smallholder supply systems
TT  - Cassava value chain
AN  - 2499023791
AB  - PurposeCommercialization of cassava is increasing because of increased urban demand for processed products and increased recognition of the industrial potential of the crop. This study aims to examine the cassava value chain in Ghana and its implications for upgrading.Design/methodology/approachA combination of purposive, simple random and snowball sampling methods was adopted to select key actors in the cassava value chain. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data. Analysis of the data was largely descriptive, except for profitability of cassava production in selected regions, which was examined by employing gross and net marketing margin analysis. A comprehensive value chain map was generated to show the different product pathways for cassava from the farm gate to the final consumer, and roles of key value chain actors and their relationships were summarized through simple narrations.FindingsEvidence has shown chains of more than four different channels through which fresh cassava roots move from the farm gate to final consumers. Production of cassava in Ghana is profitable, generating positive net marketing margins across major producing centres. Processing of cassava has both dry and wet/fresh value chains depending on the derived products for the final consumer. There is weak governance system in the cassava value chain in Ghana as majority of actors use spot market transactions in dealing with trading partners. The use of standardized grading and weighing system is very limited in the chain, and limited access to credit is a critical constraint to value chain upgrading.Research limitations/implicationsWith the exception of results from the profitability analysis of producers, the findings on marketing margins of other value chain actors may not be generalizable. Future studies could determine the profitability associated with cassava value-adding activities like processing into various forms and explore the possibility of converting waste from processing into energy.Practical implicationsThe study includes implications that focus on product and process upgrading efforts by smallholders in the cassava value chain. This paper recommends innovative financing models for smallholders to improve access to microcredit via internal and external funding sources.Originality/valueThis paper reveals specific intervention areas in which smallholders can direct efforts in an attempt to improve the cassava value chain through product, process and functional upgrading.

T1  - Negotiating the Value Chain: A Study of Surplus and Distribution in Indian Markets for Food
AN  - 2396089279
AB  - To enhance the welfare of smallholder farmers, development agencies increasingly promote “value chain agriculture” where farmers partner with more powerful entities, such as corporations and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), to create new sources of economic value. Via a qualitative study of how small farmers negotiate with the buyers of retail and agribusiness corporations in India, this article explores why the promise of value creation can appear so elusive on the ground. It makes two primary contributions. For global value chain scholars, it illustrates how studying value chains “below” the level of the firm illuminates complex ways in which new pathways for economic development are constrained by actually existing local economies—and how these local economies, rather than easily replaced, shape what counts as a source of value for small farmers. For negotiation scholars, it illustrates how, in some contexts, an equitable distribution of risk and social relationships may need to precede anything we call value creation.

T1  - SMALL-SCALE PRODUCERS OF QUALITY PRODUCTS WITH POTENTIAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATION PROTECTION IN TANZANIA
AN  - 2406321834
AB  - Geographical Indication (GI) adds value through product differentiation based on quality, protection of consumers through provision of certified information regarding product attributes and enhances and preserves the identity and cultural heritage of people in the region where a product is produced. Studies on potential GI products in Tanzania are yet to (be done) to show how producers may capture above mentioned benefits. This study analyses quality traits, factors and conditions with potential to increase value of Agricultural products in Tanzania through GI protection. The hypothesis is that origin products exist in Tanzania whose unique characteristics are linked to rather well-defined geographical areas of production. Three Tanzanian origin products were studied, and investigated as product cases: Rice from Kyela, Coffee from Kilimanjaro and Cloves from Zanzibar. Quantitative and qualitative case study analyses were done for each of the three selected Tanzanian origin products with plausible prospects for Tanzania to leapfrog into exports of Geographical Indications products. Findings shows the institutional structure of a country and how it may facilitate GI protection, the producer 's perception of being a member of a cooperatives in marketing their products, producer 's awareness of GI and the quality traits of their unique products. Finally, the paper provides policy options identifying opportunities for government in recognising unique origin products - whether agricultural or non-agricultural and the importance of potential GI's to producers and exports options for the country.

AN  - 2390067912
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of GLOBALGAP standards certification on farmer's preference for marketing contract choices including written contracts, oral contracts and spot contracts, as well as to establish the impact of marketing contracts on net returns from snap bean production in Kenya.Design/methodology/approachIn this study, we use a data collected from 446 Snap bean farmers in Kenya. Using a two-step selection Bourguignon Frontier and Gurgand (BFG) model and Propensity Score Matching (PSM), we analysed determinants of Global Gap Certification and other farming characteristics that influence smallholder farmers preference for marketing contracts and net returns from snap beans venture.FindingsResults indicate that attending GLOBALGAP training, GLOBALGAP subsidy support, membership to GLOBALGAP farmer's groups, and selling beans to GLOBALGAP certified GLOBALGAP buyers would significantly influence better returns underwritten marketing contracts. Producing snap beans underwritten marketing contracts would get farmer's net returns of between 1.8 and 8% while producing under oral and spot market contracts would earn farmer net returns of between 0.2 and 0.08 %.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to examine the influence of GLOBALGAP standards certification on marketing contract choices and net returns from snap bean production, while accounting for selectivity biasness.

T1  - TRANSDISCIPLINARY INNOVATION IN IRRIGATED SMALLHOLDER AGRICULTURE IN AFRICA
AN  - 2388849535
AB  - Boosting the productivity of smallholder farming systems continues to be a major need in Africa. Challenges relating to how to improve irrigation are multi‐factor and multisectoral, and they involve a broad range of actors who must interact to reach decisions collectively. We provide a systematic reflection on findings from the research project EAU4Food, which adopted a transdisciplinary approach to irrigation for food security research in five case studies in Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, South Africa and Tunisia. The EAU4Food experiences emphasize that actual innovation at irrigated smallholder farm level remains limited without sufficient improvement of the enabling environment and taking note of the wider political economy environment. Most project partners felt at the end of the project that the transdisciplinary approach has indeed enriched the research process by providing different and multiple insights from actors outside the academic field. Local capacity to facilitate transdisciplinary research and engagement with practitioners was developed and could support the continuation and scaling up of the approach. Future projects may benefit from a longer time frame to allow for deeper exchange of lessons learned among different stakeholders and a dedicated effort to analyse possible improvements of the enabling environment from the beginning of the research process. © 2020 The Authors.

Les problèmes relatifs à la façon d'améliorer l'irrigation sont multifactoriels et multisectoriels, impliquant un large éventail d'acteurs qui doivent interagir pour prendre des décisions collectives. Le projet de recherche EAU4Food a adopté une approche transdisciplinaire et participative dans cinq situations en Afrique du Sud, en Éthiopie, au Mali, au Mozambique et en Tunisie. Ces expériences montrent que l'innovation au niveau des exploitations agricoles ne peut se faire sans prendre en compte leur environnement et le cadre plus général des politiques agricoles. La plupart des partenaires du projet estiment que l'approche transdisciplinaire a effectivement enrichi le processus de recherche en diversifiant les points de vue. Les capacités locales de recherche transdisciplinaire ont été renforcées et cela permettra la poursuite et l'extension de cette approche. Il serait intéressant, pour les futurs projets, de disposer de plus de temps pour avoir des échanges d'expérience plus longs entre les différentes parties‐prenantes, et de prendre en compte dès le départ l'environnement des exploitations pour y faciliter l'innovation. © 2020 The Authors.

T1  - Vertical coordination mechanisms and farm performance amongst smallholder rice farmers in northern Ghana
AN  - 2387172769
AB  - Despite the fact that contracting facilitates farmer participation in agrifood value chains, evidence on farmers’ participation in different forms of contracts and the impact on farm performance is still limited. This study examines the determinants and impacts of vertical coordination mechanism‐spot market transactions, written, and verbal contract‐on‐farm performance of rice farmers in northern Ghana, using a multinomial BFG model to account for selectivity bias. The findings indicate that vertical coordination participation decision is significantly influenced by age, access to credit, labor, association membership, and sales to institutional buyers. The empirical results also reveal significant gains in farm performance outcomes from participating in written and verbal contracts, relative to spot market transactions.

T1  - Strengthening seed delivery system for enhanced adoption of improved sorghum varieties among smallholder farmers in Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia
AN  - 2555639535
AB  - Many improved sorghum varieties and hybrids have been developed by public research institutions in Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia. However, the seeds are not readily available to small-scale farmers in remote rural areas. The non-availability of improved seed is due to various reasons, including low demand for certified seed and therefore, low profitability. Sorghum has been unattractive to large seed companies, and hence is not taking up production and distribution of these improved sorghum varieties to farming communities leading to low adoption. As a result, a seed system strengthening project was initiated to enhance seed delivery in remote rural areas that cannot access seeds easily. The project is in the first year stage and is being implemented in fourteen districts of Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia. The project activities include early generation seed production of selected sorghum varieties, the establishment of promotional demonstration fields, building the capacity of seed producers and farmers in seed production through training and creating a platform for players in the sorghum seed value chain. The specific objectives are: (i) to improve the availability of sufficient quantities of early generation seed to seed producers, (ii) to strengthen the capacity of sorghum seed value chain players involved in the promotion of released sorghum varieties, and (iii) to promote the use of sorghum certified seed by small scale farmers. The research outputs so far achieved are 250 farmers have been trained in seed production, 10 tons of basic seed of selected varieties have been produced and 144 sites have been established.

T1  - Moving smallholders up rice value chain: a system dynamics approach
TT  - Rice value chain
AN  - 2534587988
AB  - PurposePaddy farmers form the backbone of food security. However, poverty plagues them despite having linked them to the rice value chain. To overcome this, the concept of involving smallholders in post-farm value chain stages is promoted. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of upgrading smallholder involvement in rice value chains through the adoption of a sustainability standard.Design/methodology/approachThe authors built a system dynamic model to capture both conventional and certified sub-value chains. The latter deviates from the conventional one and capitalizes on compliance to a sustainability standard.FindingsWhen compared to conventional farm gate sales methods, the simulations revealed obvious profitability of direct marketing with respect to certified sustainable rice. Although coupled with productivity growth, the simulations indicated the shift to standard adoption would likely to be both limited and slow.Originality/valueThe findings suggest that the profitability of a certified rice value chain will remain fettered. In order to enhance both farmer livelihood and food security, given the limited prospect of moving smallholders up that chain, the authors conclude that national policy should be rationalized and concentrated on the possibility of diversifying the end-use of rice through research, development and subsequent commercialization.

T1  - Do Sustainability Standards Benefit Smallholder Farmers Also When Accounting For Cooperative Effects? Evidence from Côte d'Ivoire
AN  - 2511822111
AB  - Although many studies analyzed effects of sustainability standards—such as Fairtrade or Rainforest Alliance—on smallholder farmers in developing countries, most did not sufficiently account for systematic differences between certified and noncertified farmers. Certified farmers are typically organized in cooperatives. When sampling only from a small number of cooperatives, as previous studies did, it is not easy to disentangle certification effects from possible cooperative effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by randomly sampling from a large number of cooperatives, thus better capturing existing institutional heterogeneity. In particular, we collect and use data from cocoa farmers in Côte d'Ivoire who are organized in Fairtrade‐certified and noncertified cooperatives. Regression models with instrumental variables show that Fairtrade has positive and significant effects on cocoa yields, prices, and living standards. These effects remain significant also after controlling for cooperative characteristics, but the magnitude of the estimates changes. We draw two conclusions. First, in Côte d'Ivoire, Fairtrade certification benefits farmers economically. Second, and more generally, cooperative characteristics are jointly correlated with certification and relevant outcomes, which needs to be accounted for to avoid bias when evaluating the benefits of sustainability standards in the small farm sector.

T1  - Smallholder farmers’ knowledge and willingness to pay for insect-based feeds in Kenya
AN  - 2382996373
AB  - Edible insects are increasingly being considered as sustainable alternatives to fish and soybean meals in animal feed because of their high nutritional quality and environmental benefits. However, successful introduction of a new product to the market depends on the target user’s acceptance. Thus, evaluating the potential demand of insect-based feeds would provide relevant information for policy development. The present study assessed farmers’ knowledge on edible insects as feed, their acceptance of integrating insect meals in animal feeds and willingness to pay (WTP) for insect-based feed (IBF) using a contingent valuation method. A household survey was conducted among 957 randomly selected farmers including: 409 poultry, 241 fish and 307 pig farmers in four counties in Kenya. Results of the study reveal that over 70 and 80% of poultry and fish farmers, respectively, are aware that insects can be used as a feed ingredient. In addition, over 60 and 75% of poultry and fish farmers, respectively, consider insects as a good component of feed. Poultry, pig and fish farmers interviewed accepted and showed willingness to pay for IBF. Regression analysis indicated that age, gender, education, marital status, distance to feed trader, awareness of insects as feed, attitude towards insects, acceptance of insect species, availability of agricultural inputs, use of commercial feeds, availability of training and market information had a significant influence on the WTP for IBF. Therefore, increased extension services to educate famers on the nutritional benefits of insect meals in animal feeds and existing market opportunities are expected to improve farmers’ attitude towards utilization and consequently enhance WTP for IBF, which in return would significantly reduce the existing pressure on conventional fishmeal feed resources. Our findings provide the first insights into the market opportunities of including insect meals in the animal feed value chain in Kenya.

T1  - Sticking with the old seed: Input value chains and the challenges to deliver genetic gains to smallholder maize farmers
AN  - 2382525485
AB  - The Kenyan maize seed sector exhibits high hybrid adoption rates, a growing number of seed companies, and an extensive agro-dealer network. Nonetheless, maize yields remain low and uptake of new, stress-tolerant varieties has been disappointing. This article investigates interactions in maize seed value chains in Kenya, and decisions made by agro-dealers, farmers, and seed companies, to gain a better understanding of how to encourage the uptake of new, stress-tolerant varieties. Data were collected during the 2019 seed-purchasing season from Kenyan seed companies (n = 8), agro-dealers (n = 80), and farmers immediately following their seed purchase (n = 466). Most agro-dealers had a wide offer of seed products available, but seed companies’ engagement with them was limited and marketing efforts were directly focused on farmers. Only a fraction of farmers used the agro-dealer environment to guide their decision-making. However, when agro-dealers engaged with farmers, they influenced varietal selection in 80% of the cases. Agro-dealers were one of the key information outlets about maize seed varieties. Seed company engagement with agro-dealers and in-store promotions (push marketing) should be further explored to improve returns on investments in seed systems.

T1  - Smaller-scale land grabs and accumulation from below: Violence, coercion and consent in spatially uneven agrarian change in Shan State, Myanmar
AN  - 2376214529
AB  - This article presents field research data on a smallholder maize crop boom in Shan State, northern Myanmar, and its spatially uneven dispossessory effects. Local research teams studied eight villages, four in the north and an equal number in the south of Shan State, using focus group discussions and randomized household interviews, supplemented with key informant interviews. This study deepens the global land grab debate by highlighting the role of smallholder cash crop booms in "smaller-scale" land grabs that have been shown to be significant drivers of agrarian transformation, especially in Southeast Asia. The article builds on the conceptualization of "accumulation from below" by accounting for the geographically differentiated processes of dispossession from smallholder contract farming arrangements, its variant forms of coercion and consent, and the political contingencies that give rise to and help explain uneven agrarian change. The study's findings demonstrate how political contingency shapes spatial patterns of accumulation and dispossession through regional and local variations in the politics of ethnic identity, migration, insurgency and an illicit drugs economy. These political dynamics inform the hierarchy of power and cultural familiarity between smallholders and local state-supported "silent strongmen", in this case town moneylenders and village elites, which-together with several other identified factors, especially the poppy economy-influence the spatial distribution of dispossession. Neither extra-economic coercion within orbits of state power nor simply accumulation from below by market opportunities adequately explains uneven agrarian transformation. Instead, the analytical frame on forms of violence in capital accumulation should be expanded and deepened in order to better capture the complex coming together of violence, coercion and consent that is geographically specific, and taken together is more than the sum of their parts.

T1  - Building Trustworthy Relationships with Smallholder(Small-scale) Agro-commodity Suppliers: Insights from the Ghana Cocoa Industry
AN  - 2351411574
AB  - The purpose of the study is to investigate which factors lead firms should consider in their quest to build trustworthy supply relationships with agro-commodity suppliers. We developed a model of opportunism-trust relationships, which we analyzed in the context of a smallholder agro-commodity supply market (SHACSM). The data source is a survey of 444 buyer-supplier relationships from the cocoa industry of Ghana. The analysis shows that relational satisfaction, cooperation and information exchange reduce perceptions of opportunism consistent with the literature. However, multigroup analysis suggests differences in perception between men and women farm owners/managers. While men perceived the important role of information exchange in reducing perceptions of opportunism, women farm owners/managers were more concerned about the negative consequence of opportunism on trust. We discuss implications for theory, public policy, and macromarketing practice, and suggest options for future research.

T1  - What is technology adoption? Exploring the agricultural research value chain for smallholder farmers in Lao PDR
AN  - 2240385457
AB  - A common and driving assumption in agricultural research is that the introduction of research trials, new practices and innovative technologies will result in technology adoption, and will subsequently generate benefits for farmers and other stakeholders. In Lao PDR, the potential benefits of introduced technologies have not been fully realised by beneficiaries. We report on an analysis of a survey of 735 smallholder farmers in Southern Lao PDR who were questioned about factors that influenced their decisions to adopt new technologies. In this study, we have constructed measures or states of adoption which identify key elements of an adoption decision-making nexus. Analysis was conducted to statistically group explanatory factors of adoption. The key explanatory factors represented attributes of the farmer, the factors considered when undertaking production decisions and elements of the agricultural value chain that present as opportunities or constraints. We describe the combination of farmer’s personal attributes, perceptions of the value chain, and the introduction of new technologies by external actors as an “agricultural research value chain”, where agricultural research activities intervene to derive greater benefits for local farmers. A generalised linear model, via Poisson (multiple) regression analysis on the identified explanatory factors, was applied to explore how they influence adoption measures and we found several significant relationships.

T1  - Reconciling oil palm economic development and environmental conservation in Indonesia: A value chain dynamic approach
AN  - 2375826214
AB  - Palm oil makes a significant contribution to the economies of Indonesia and Malaysia through private corporations, state-owned companies and smallholders, with the two countries supplying 85% of the global palm oil. Indonesia has 14 million hectares (ha) of oil palm; its palm oil exports were valued at USD 23 billion in 2017 and USD 21 billion in 2018. Both domestic and international communities, particularly the European Union (EU), have raised concerns about its sustainability and impact on forest conservation. For example, the European Parliament in 2017 issued a resolution to restrict the ability of EU countries to count palm oil-based biodiesel imports toward their renewable 2030 energy targets. This paper describes palm oil value chains in Indonesia at the national level, using value chain analysis and system dynamics modeling. The model is used to understand how the moratorium, peatland conservation, agrarian reform, and the EU biodiesel ban affect plantation expansion and production, employment, CO2 emissions, smallholder incomes, the private sector, and government. The model provides scenarios to make Indonesian palm oil more sustainable through intensification, no-deforestation, and no-peat strategies, as well as through land swapping. There are trade-offs between economic development and environmental conservation, but win-win solutions are available. Scenarios that build synergies between Indonesian palm oil development and forest conservation can help guide the new frontiers of oil palm development in Asia, South America, and Africa.

T1  - Integrating diversity of smallholder coffee cropping systems in environmental analysis
AN  - 2348856081
AB  - PurposeCoffee represents an important trade asset internationally. Around 70% of global coffee production is provided by 25 million smallholders farmers. In recent decades, coffee systems have been transformed into more intensified systems of coffee monoculture. The general objectives of this paper are to provide a better picture of the traditional coffee cropping systems and postharvest processes on-farm and to assess the environmental impacts, integrating the diversity of smallholder cropping systems.MethodsA Life Cycle Assessment from cradle to farm gate was performed for three cropping systems representative of Colombian coffee cultivation according to the associated crops and shadow trees: coffee alone (CA), coffee with transition shade (CTS), and coffee with permanent shade (CPS). The system studied includes inputs, agricultural production and postharvest operations using the wet method. The final product of farms is parchment bean coffee at farm gate. The technology used is representative of the average practices of smallholder coffee growers in the region. To address multiple functions of coffee, three functional units (FU) were selected: area by time (ha*year−1 unit area), productivity (ton of parchment coffee) and farmers income (1000 USD$). Seven midpoint categories were selected: climate change, acidification, terrestrial eutrophication, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, and water resource depletion.Results and discussionWe present the life cycle inventory and impact assessment results from three types of cropping systems CA, CTS and CPS. For all FU, the CPS system has the lowest potential impact, excepted for marine eutrophication. CPS also has the highest coffee yields, however it has also the highest costs. Even if cropping system diversification is only one of multiple factors that influence environmental performance, agroforestry seems to be a promising path to reduce and mitigate environmental impacts by decreasing off-fam contributions (input fabrication).ConclusionsResults show the possibility that diversified cropping systems have an influence when assessing potential environmental impacts of coffee at farm gate and differences found might be influenced by shading in traditional coffee systems. Future work is needed to consider the real potential of CTS cropping system including land use and carbon dynamics. Assessments including social indicators and the rest of the value chain in particular coffee industrial transformation and utilization are also needed since the consumption stages are also a key driver to reduce the environmental footprint of coffee.

AN  - 2765083182
AB  - La alta dependencia de los habitantes rurales de los ingresos provenientes de la venta de productos agrícolas, la heterogeneidad de los procesos productivos y la asignación permanente de recursos públicos y privados al sector primario han fortalecido las cadenas de valor. En este contexto, el objetivo principal de este artículo es identificar la composición, funcionamiento y desafíos de los agentes económicos en el proceso productivo generador de valor de la leche de vaca en el cantón Gonzanamá. Para ello, se aplicó y procesó información de 101 productores de leche y dos microempresarios, complementada con información secundaria derivada de instituciones gubernamentales y ONG. Se obtuvo una cadena de valor de la leche de vaca con seis encadenamientos productivos con su segmentación, características y desafíos. Se concluyó que la cadena agroalimentaria local y rural del cantón Gonzanamá se caracteriza por tener pequeños agricultores con sistemas de producción tradicionales y temporales, informalidad en el acopio de materias primas y productos transformados. microempresas con escasa materia prima, infraestructura, talento humano y oferta de productos poco diferenciados para el mercado de consumo. Los agentes indirectos sólo regulan la actividad agrícola y sus procesos de generación de valor.Alternate abstract:The high dependence of rural inhabitants on income from the sale of agricultural products, the heterogeneity of production processes, and the permanent allocation of public and private resources to the primary sector have strengthened value chains. In this context, the article's main objective is to identify the composition, functioning, and challenges of economic agents in the production process that generates value for cow's milk in Gonzanamá canton. For that, information from 101 milk producers and two micro-entrepreneurs was applied and processed, supplemented with secondary information derived from government institutions and NGOs. We obtained a cow's milk value chain with six productive chains with their segmentation, features, and challenges. We concluded that Gonzanama's rural and local agri-food chain characterize by small farmers with traditional and temporary production systems, informality in the collection of raw materials, and transformed products. Micro-enterprises with scarce human talent, raw materials, infrastructure, and little differentiated products for the consumer market. Indirect agents only regulate agricultural activity and its value generation processes.

T1  - An Analysis of the Tax Incidence of VAT to Milk in Malawi
AN  - 2548864198
AB  - Dairy is a key investment sector for the Government of Malawi. On 1 October 2016, the Malawi Revenue Authority announced that milk, which until then had been exempted from value added tax (VAT), was going to be taxed at the standard rate of 16.5 percent. The measure has been met with strong opposition and thus, was short lived (eliminated in May 2017). The purpose of this paper is to present an analysis of the effect that such a tax would have on its incidence, on the different stages of the supply chain, and ultimately on its economic and social sustainability. The paper investigates these implications by developing a multimarket model applied to the Malawian dairy supply chain. The results indicate that 24.3 percent of the VAT revenues would be borne by consumers and the remaining 75.7 percent would be borne by the domestic dairy industry (i.e., processors and smallholder farmers). This was due mainly to the value of the price elasticity of consumers’ demand for pasteurised milk. The results highlight the vulnerability of inclusive value chains to economic policies that may affect consumers’ demand.

T1  - An Evolving Agricultural Extension Model for Lasting Impact: How Willing Are Tanzanian Farmers to Pay for Extension Services?
AN  - 2548732559
AB  - Community-based extension services (CES) are vital for improving farmers’ livelihoods, but most of them face a challenge of sustainability after phasing out of the externally funded initiatives that they are part of. This study estimated farmer’s willingness to pay (WTP) for four types of agricultural extension services (AES) in the cereals’ value chains provided as a part of two United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Feed the Future initiatives in Tanzania. Data were collected from 595 smallholder cereal farmers using a primary survey in four districts of the Southern Highlands. We implemented a double-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation method. Average WTP figures ranged from 20,000 to 24,000 TZS (8–10 USD) depending on the type of AES. Several socioeconomic and agriculture-related variables influenced smallholders’ WTP for the extension services. This research explored the feasibility of a farmer-led model as a pathway to delink extension services from public and donor funding to achieve sustainable rural development. Farmers place a monetary value on extension services indicating that policymakers and practitioners should make further efforts to enhance a community’s ability to achieve self-reliance through investments in CES.

T1  - The impact of credit on productivity of smallholder farmers in Ghana
TT  - Productivity of smallholder farmers in Ghana
AN  - 2534620756
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of access to production credit on the productivity of smallholder farmers.Design/methodology/approachData for the study were drawn from the Agricultural Value Chain Facility (AVCF), which was implemented in the Northern Region of Ghana. This paper uses the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to estimate the average treatment effect of access to production credit on the productivity of smallholder farmers. The rationale for the choice of this estimation technique is to control for selection bias since the treatment variable (access to production credit) was not randomised. The authors also test for the effect of hidden bias using “Rosenbaum bounds” sensitivity analysis. The study uses two control groups to examine the net effect of credit on productivity.FindingsThe results reveal that smallholder farmers with access to production credit increased productivity through investment in farm inputs. For the impact of credit on productivity using control Group 1, the result shows that farmers with access to credit increased their productivity by 0.170 metric tonnes per hectare and for control Group 2, the result shows an increase of 0.252 metric tonnes per hectare more than farmers who are without access to production credit.Practical implicationsThe evidence as provided by this paper is that access to production credit is significant to meet the credit needs of smallholder farmers and therefore contributes to the policy debate on whether access to credit has impact on the productivity of smallholder farmers.Originality/valueThe paper shows the importance of production credit in augmenting the production function of smallholder farmers.

T1  - Mainstreaming Agricultural Biodiversity in Traditional Production Landscapes for Sustainable Development: The Indian Scenario
AN  - 2524963336
AB  - Mainstreaming biodiversity in production landscapes ensures conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biodiversity, the key objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the projects supported by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Global Environment Facility (GEF). Mainstreaming integrates biodiversity in existing or new programs and policies, both cross-sectoral and sector-specific. The conventional model of agricultural production with limited diversity in production systems and use of high chemical input has taught us a valuable lesson as it is adversely impacting the environment, the essential ecosystem services, the soil health and the long term sustainability of our food systems. Using a qualitative participant observation approach, our study investigated four distinct traditional Indian production landscapes to gage (i) the farming communities’ response to institutional policies, programs and agricultural biodiversity-related activities in traditional Indian production landscapes and (ii) opportunities and challenges for sustainable development in smallholder traditional Indian farming systems. Results indicate that the top-down decision-making regime is the least effective towards achieving sustainable development in traditional Indian farming landscapes and that farmers’ experiential knowledge on participatory biodiversity management, maintenance and use for sustainable development are of critical importance to India’s agriculture and economy. Reclaiming agriculture’s spiritual roots through organic farming and locally grown food emerged as key, including the need for designing and implementing a more sovereign food system. Revisiting traditional smallholder farming under the COVID-19 pandemic and lessons learned for repurposing India’s agricultural policy are also highlighted.

AN  - 2519889417
AB  - Kajian ini bertujuan menghurai dan menganalisis varians pencapaian item prestasi kewangan dan bukan-kewangan dalam model perniagaan koperasi pekebun kecil sawit (PKS) FELDA, FELCRA dan KPSM. Model perniagaan koperasi yang berbeza berpotensi mewujudkan variasi dalam prestasi. Kajian ini menggunakan teknik survei bagi mengumpul data daripada 234 buah koperasi sawit di Semenanjung Malaysia. Analisis statistik deskriptif, ANOVA-Satu Hala dan Analisis Post Hoc telah digunakan bagi menganalisis data. Hasil menunjukkan kebanyakan koperasi PKS cenderung menggunakan strategi pembezaan produk/perkhidmatandengan cara menawarkan perkhidmatan pusat pengumpulan buah sawit dan mengurus kerja ladang kepada ahli sebagai usahanya menjana pendapatan. Hasil ujian ANOVA mendapati koperasi KPSM berbeza min secara signifikan dengan model koperasi FELDA dalam item prestasi kewangan berkaitan "mencapai untung sasaran" dan "kekukuhan kedudukan tunai bagi menyelesaikan liabiliti jangka pendek". Pada masa yang sama model FELDA dan FELCRA berbeza secara signifikan dalam pencapaian item prestasi kewangan berkaitan "bayaran dividen minimum kepada ahli-ahli". Di samping itu, petunjuk prestasi bukan kewangan juga menunjukkan perbezaan min yang signifikan di antara koperasi KPSM dan FELDA pada item "bantuan pendidikan kepada anak-anak ahli". Kajian ini menyumbang kepada ilmu dengan mengemukakan perbincangan prestasi merentasi model koperasi berbeza dalam konteks koperasi pekebun kecil sawit (PKS) di Malaysia. Implikasi praktikal kajian ialah pengurusan koperasi boleh mengoptimumkan kelebihan semulajadi entiti koperasi bagi memperkasa daya saing iaitu menerusi peluang kawalan ke atas seluruh rantaian nilai aktiviti sawit dan manfaat hubungan simbiotik dengan agensi induk. Daripada sudut ilmu, kajian ini telah menambah ilmu baharu dalam skop bidang Kelakuan Organisasi dan Pengurusan Strategik dengan mengemukakan dapatan mengenai prestasi koperasi PKS yang masih kurang dikaji.Alternate abstract:This study aims to describe and analyze the financial and non-financial performance variance among the palm oil smallholders cooperative business model of the FELDA, FELCRA and KPSM. Different cooperative business model potentially creates variation in the performance. This study employs survey technique to gather data from 234 palm oil cooperatives in Peninsular Malaysia. Descriptive, One Way ANOVA and Post Hoc analysis are used to analyze the data. The findings show that most smallholders cooperative lean to adopt the product/service differentiation strategyby the offering of the one stop fresh fruit bunch agglomeration centre and to manage members' farm- as its effort to generate income. Based on the ANOVA analysis, the KPSM cooperatives differ significantly from the FELDA cooperative model in the financial performance items consist of "achieving the target profit" and "strength of cash position to cover short term liabilities". Simultaneously, the FELDA and FELCRA models differ significantly in terms of financial performance item related to "dividend payment to members". Furthermore, the non financial performance shows significant mean differences between KPSM and FELDA in "education aid for members' children" item. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by elaborating performance across different cooperative models within the Malaysia palm oil smallholders' cooperative context. Practical implication derives from the study is the cooperative management can optimize the natural strengths of cooperative entities to strenghten competitiveness through the opportunity to control the entire palm oil value chain activities and the benefit of the symbiotic relationships with parent agencies. From the knowledge aspect, this study expand new knowledge within the scope of Organizational Behaviour and Strategic Management fields by presenting findings related to the performance of palm oil smallholders'cooperative which are still understudied.

T1  - Identiti koperasi pekebun kecil sawit di Malaysia: Satu deskripsi awal (The identity of palm oil smallholders’ cooperative in Malaysia: A preliminary descriptive)
AN  - 2486212398
AB  - Koperasi adalah entiti yang ditubuhkan bagi mencapai matlamat ahli yang homogenous sifatnya.  Secara umumnya, koperasi bertujuan menjaga kebajikan ahli-ahlinya. Namun selari dengan perkembangan semasa entiti koperasi turut berhadapan suasana baharu yang berpotensi memberi kesan kepada identitinya.  Selain daripada itu, faktor kontekstual juga berpotensi mewujudkan pola tertentu dalam pengoperasian konsep koperasi. Makalah ini bertujuan mendeskripsi ciri-ciri identiti koperasi pekebun kecil kelapa sawit di Malaysia. Kajian ini telah menggunakan teknik temubual dengan enam buah koperasi di negeri Selangor, Perak dan Johor. Data temubual telah dianalisa dengan kaedah tematik bagi mengenalpasti ciri-ciri identiti koperasi. Penemuan kajian menunjukkan koperasi pekebun kecil kelapa sawit dianggotai oleh pekebun atau peneroka dan generasi kedua dari kalangan mereka. Koperasi mempunyai struktur Ahli Lembaga Koperasi yang dipilih daripada ahli-ahli koperasi dan memiliki autonomi dalam membuat keputusan tanpa campur tangan pihak luar. Perkhidmatan yang ditawarkan adalah cenderung ke arah portfolio perniagaan yang “selamat” dan “rendah risiko”. Walau bagaimanapun, koperasi pekebun kecil sawit terlibat menunjukkan pola pengembangan portfolio perniagaan yang tidak lagi tertumpu kepada pelaburan atau aktiviti-aktiviti pasif. Koperasi pekebun kecil kelapa sawit cenderung untuk terlibat dalam aktiviti penjanaan hasil yang lebih berdaya maju. Namun begitu secara keseluruhan, orientasi keusahawanan koperasi menunjukkan trend yang konsisten dengan corak penawaran perkhidmatan yang masih bersifat konservatif dan berhati-hati.Alternate abstract:Cooperatives are entities that established to achieve the goals of homogeneous members. Generally, a cooperative aim to protect the well-being of its members. But in line with the current development, a cooperative entity is also facing a new environment that could potentially affect its identity. In addition, contextual factors have the potential to create certain patterns in operationalizing cooperative concepts. This paper aims at describing the identity characteristics of oil palm smallholder cooperatives in Malaysia. This study employed interview techniques with six cooperatives in the states of Selangor, Perak and Johor. The findings of this study show that oil palm cooperatives belong to both farmers and settlers and also their second generations. The cooperative has the structure of a Cooperative Board Member selected from the members of the cooperative and has the autonomy in decision-making without external intervention. The services offered are likely to be towards a "safe" and "low risk" business portfolio. However, the cooperative of smallholders shown a pattern of expanding business portfolios that is no longer focused on investment or passive activities. The oil palm smallholders' cooperatives are increasingly becoming more involved in more productive yields. However, the overall entrepreneurial orientation reflects a consistent trend that offer services with conservative and cautious pattern.

T1  - Technical efficiency and impact of improved farm inputs adoption on the yield of haricot bean producer in Hadiya zone, SNNP region, Ethiopia
AN  - 2485461720
AB  - Haricot bean is one of the most important food legumes of Ethiopia and it is considered as the main cash crop and the least expensive source of protein for the farmers. Low production and productivity, which are mainly associated with poor adoption and inefficient implementation of improved farm technologies, were among the major problems. Adoption and efficient utilization of improved farm inputs is one of the most promising ways to reduce food insecurity in study area. However, the adoption and implementation of these improved farm inputs is constrained by various factors. So, the aim of this study was to analyze the technical efficiency and impact of improved farm inputs adoption on the yield of haricot bean producers. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed to select 231 sample household heads and they were interviewed using structured interview schedule. Data analysis was done with the help of Stochastic Frontier Analysis; mainly Cobb-Douglas Production Function, logistic regression model were employed. The Stochastic Production Frontier result revealed that the allocated amount of land, labour, seed, chemical fertilizer and oxen were appeared to be positively and significantly influencing haricot bean production of both adopters and total sampled householders. The result of logistic regression model indicated that the probability of adoption of improved farm inputs affected by extension service, information access and cooperative membership positively and by market distance and crop diversification negatively. Therefore, specialization, asset formation, innovative institutional arrangement, information, extension and farmers training accompanied with more access to chemical fertilizer in the study area.

T1  - Analysis of banana value chain in Ethiopia: Approaches to sustainable value chain development
AN  - 2480198827
AB  - Banana is an important commercial fruit crop for smallholder farmers in Arba Minch, southern Ethiopia. However, its sector is experiencing many constraints and limited attention given to productivity and marketing. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the banana value chain in order to identify constraints on productivity and marketing, and possibilities of improvements towards a sustainable value chain in Arba Minch. Data were collected through a survey, key informants’ interviews, and focus group discussions. Different analytical and statistical tools were used for data analysis. Results describe actors, supporters, and influencers of the existing banana chain. The current banana chain has three different distribution channels in Arba Minch. The channel that connects with rural consumers has the highest value share for farmers while the channel that includes traveling traders has the lowest value share for farmers. The marketing cooperative channel has an intermediate value share for farmers in the chain. Poor agronomic practice, diseases, pests, and climate change were the major constraints for the banana yield while limited market information, lack of cold store and refrigerated trucks, poor post-harvest handling, lack of alternative markets, and weak capacity of cooperatives were the main constraints for banana marketing in Arba Minch. Economic, social and environmental indicators have a moderate sustainability performance within the Ethiopian context. The chain has an advantage in terms of profitability, employment, emission of air pollutants and constraints in terms of coordination, value share, profit margin, market diversity, product and market information, transportation, waste management, and safety and hygiene.

T1  - The interaction between pests, mixed-maize crop production and food security: a case study of smallholder farmers in Mwea West, Kenya
AN  - 2480198687
AB  - Crop pests (weeds, insect pests and pathogens) are recognised worldwide as a serious challenge to agricultural production and threat to food security. Potential losses due to weeds, animal pests and pathogens have been reported at 34%, 18% and 16%, respectively. In monetary terms losses can be high, for example, annual smallholder losses due to just five invasive species in six African countries have been estimated at US$0.9–1.1 billion. Here, smallholder mixed maize farmers’ perceptions of the key constraints to their farming practices are considered. Semi-structured interviews with smallholder households, in addition to key informant interviews, reveal that farmers report insect pests, pathogens and weeds (collectively “pests”) as the main constraints to farm production. Farmers report yield losses experienced due to pests, together with control expenditure significantly affect net income whilst undermining other livelihood assets. Farmers in Mwea West are highly vulnerable to a range of pests including a number of invasive alien species. Importantly, the farmer perceptions in this study agree with major research studies and confirm the serious impacts of pests on smallholder livelihoods. In order to achieve positive livelihood outcomes there is an urgent need for support to improve smallholder food security; this is especially important for countries with low gross domestic product.

T1  - Effect of integrated technologies on the productivity of maize, sorghum and pearl millet crops for improving resilience capacity to climate change effects in the dry lands of Eastern Amhara, Ethiopia
AN  - 2480198544
AB  - Three sets of field experiments were conducted both on farmer fields and on experiment stations on Kobo areas of eastern Amhara region during 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons to evaluate and introduce dry land crop production technologies that would reduce crop failure and increase productivity of crops. Integrated technologies that were evaluated include: micro-dose fertilizer, moisture conservation, seed priming, intercropping, and row planting. The experimental design was randomized complete block (RCB) with three replications consisted of 14 treatments. The results revealed that the highest grain yield (5032 and 4328 kg/ha) of sorghum was recorded with application of recommended fertilizer rate + primed seed + tied ridge and micro-dose fertilizer + primed seed + tied ridge + intercropping with haricot bean, respectively. For pearl millet, the highest grain yield (3355 and 3145 kg/ha) was recorded with application of micro-dose fertilizer + dry seed + tied ridge and recommended fertilizer rate + dry seed + tied ridge, respectively. For maize, the highest grain yield (4414 and 4392 kg/ha) was recorded with application of micro-dose fertilizer + primed seed + tied ridge + intercropping mung bean and recommended fertilizer rate + dry seed + tied ridge. From the results of on-station and on-farm trials at Kobo, recommended fertilizer rate + primed seed + tied-ridge for sorghum testing crop, recommended fertilizer rate + dry seed + tied-ridge for pearl millet and micro-dose fertilizer + primed seed + tied ridge + intercropping with mung bean for maize was recommended for kobo and similar areas.

T1  - Adoption of rainwater harvesting and its impact on smallholder farmer livelihoods in Kutaber district, South Wollo Zone, Ethiopia
AN  - 2480198454
AB  - This study aimed to identify determinants of rainwater harvesting adoption, and evaluate its impact on livelihood of smallholder farmers in Kutaber district. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed to select 196 sample households. Descriptive statistics and econometric models were used to analyze the primary data. Logit model was used to identify determinants of rainwater harvesting adoption while propensity score matching was used to evaluate its impact on livelihood of smallholder farmers. The result of logit model revealed that education level, family size, farming experience, participation in technology demonstration, and membership in farmer cooperative were significantly and positively affected adoption of rainwater harvesting technology, while age of household head negatively affected it. The finding of this study showed that adoption of rainwater harvesting technology have a positive and significant effect on the livelihood of farmers in terms of household annual farm income and food security. The result indicated that rainwater harvesting has significantly increased adopters' annual farm income by 35.13% and daily calorie intake per adult equivalent by 15.56% than non-adopters. Therefore, it is recommended to alter the attitude of technology averse older farmers, enhance farmer training and experience sharing, accessible demonstration sites and farmer cooperative to achieve extensive adoption of the technology thereby improve farmer’s livelihood.

T1  - Enhancing knowledge exchange and performance recording through use of short messaging service in smallholder dairy farming systems in Malawi
AN  - 2480198423
AB  - Monitoring animal performance is a challenge due to lack of systematic recording in the smallholder dairy sector in Malawi. A mobile recording system using short messaging service (SMS) was therefore trialled for data capturing and subsequent feedback provision to farmers following analyses and interpretation. This study aimed at drawing lessons regarding use of SMS recording system among dairy farmers. Of the 210 participants, 85% were farmers and 25% were other dairy value chain players. Farmers were from eight intervened (monitored for 18 months) and eight control Milk Bulking Groups (MBG). There are three regions in Malawi and Central region had the highest participants [59% (124)] than Northern [23% (49)] and Southern [1% (2)] regions submitting data using SMS. Milk production was the most recorded data and analyses showed that mean yield in litres per cow (10.7 ± 0.14) was similar to average estimate in literature for Malawi (10.4 ± 1.57). Household daily milk consumption (1.2 ± 0.04), milk sold through formal market (610.0 ± 55) and amount of milk rejected per day per MBG (5.9 ± 0.86) in litres were captured. Farmers asked questions and received timely feedback via SMS. Therefore, it is possible to capture quality data using SMS technology that is adequate for conducting analyses to inform decision-making.

T1  - Innovation platform for improving rice marketing decisions among smallholder farmers in Homa-Bay County, Kenya
AN  - 2480198401
AB  - Smallholder farmers are normally faced with making a decision on market participation and consequently choosing the appropriate marketing channel for their agricultural produce. This study focuses on how a multi-stakeholder innovation platform approach for improving the uptake of System of Rice Intensification and rice productivity influences marketing decisions among smallholder rice farmers. The study relies on primary data collected from 102 households in Homa-Bay County, Kenya. Logistic and multinomial logistic regression models were used in the analysis. The practice of system of rice intensification, membership to farmer groups, frequency of access to extension services, distance to the nearest market and access to transportation facilities were important determinants to market participation among farmers. A farmers’ choice of marketing channel was commonly influenced by size of land under rice cultivation, access to transport facilities and whether rice was to be sold collectively or individually. We therefore conclude that the multi-stakeholder innovation platform approach improves decision making in marketing. We thus recommend that governments embrace multi-stakeholder Innovation Platforms as a framework for improving farmer participation in rice markets and improving decision making when approaching available markets.

T1  - Farmer groups, collective marketing and smallholder farm performance in rural Ghana
TT  - Farmer groups and collective marketing
AN  - 2460676956
AB  - PurposeRapid transformation of agrifood value chains because of population growth, urbanization, rising consumer incomes and increased demand for food quality and safety has resulted in the need for smallholder farmers to coordinate horizontally through group formation and collective marketing to improve farm performance in developing countries. This paper aims to examine the factors that influence farmer group membership and collective marketing decisions and their impacts on smallholder farm performance in rural Ghana.Design/methodology/approachUsing data from a recent survey of 447 rice farmers in rural Ghana, an endogenous switching regression model is employed to account for selection bias arising from both observable and unobservable farmer attributes.FindingsThe data reveal that group members and collective marketing participants obtained higher prices and also incurred lower input costs. The econometric estimates show that age, access to credit, mobile phone ownership, distance to market and road status are the main drivers of group membership and collective marketing decisions. The authors also find positive and significant impacts of farmer group membership and collective marketing on farm net revenues.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings from this study suggest that government and donor support for the formation of farmer groups during implementation of agriculture and value chain interventions should as well incorporate strategies to facilitate collective marketing.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to examine the role farmer groups and collective marketing play in improving smallholder farm performance.

T1  - Drivers of Transformations in Smallholder Indigenous Vegetable Value Chains in Western Kenya: Evolution of Contract Farming
AN  - 2447590781
AB  - Horticultural farmers, especially vegetable producers are characterized by poor access to inputs such as credit and operate in unreliable inputs and outputs markets. Empirical evidence shows that contract farming can potentially solve these constraints. However, contract violation is evident among smallholder farmers in many developing countries. This study assessed the main drivers of recent transformations in AIVs value chains including the emerging forms of and drivers of contract violation among smallholder farmers in Western Kenya. Results from analysis of data from a focused group discussion and key informant interviews showed that climate change and technology are among the key drivers.

T1  - Farmers' preferences and willingness to pay for microcredit in Benin: results from in-the-field choice experiments in Benin
TT  - Farmers’ preferences and willingness to pay for microcredit
AN  - 2447391184
AB  - PurposeThis document analyses farmers' preferences and willingness to pay (CAP) for microcredit, in order to facilitate their access in rural areas.Design/methodology/approachData are based on a discrete choice experiment with 400 randomly selected farmers from 20 villages of the 7 Benin agricultural development hubs (ADHs). The preference choice modelling was performed using mixed logit (MXL) and latent class logit (LCL) models. Farmers' willingness to pay for each preferred attribute was estimated. The endogenous attribute attendance (EAA) model was also used to capture attribute non-attendance (ANA) phenomenon.FindingsThe results indicate that, on average, farmers prefer individual loans, low interest rates, in kind + cash loans, cash loans, disbursement before planting and loans with at least 10-month duration. These preferences vary according to farmers' classes. Farmers are willing to pay higher or lower interest rates depending on attribute importance. The estimate of the EAA model indicates that, when taking the ANA phenomenon into consideration, people will show stronger attitudes regarding WTP for important factors.Research limitations/implicationsBased on these results from Benin, microfinance institutions (MFIs) in developing countries can, based on the interest rates currently charged, attract more farmers as customers, reviewing the combination of the levels of the attributes associated with the nature of the loan, the type of loan (individual or collective), the disbursement period of funds, the waiting period of the loan and the loan duration. However, the study only considered production credit, ignoring equipment or investment credit.Practical implicationsThe document provides information on the key factors that can facilitate producers' access to MFI products and services.Social implicationsFacilitating small farmers' access to financial service will contribute to poverty reduction.Originality/valueThis research contributes to the knowledge of the attributes and attribute levels favoured by farmers when choosing financial products and the amounts they agree to pay for these attributes. The implementation of the results would facilitate small producers' access to financial services; thus contributing to poverty reduction.

T1  - Determinants of Farm Resilience to Climate Change: The Role of Farmer Entrepreneurship and Value Chain Collaborations
AN  - 2443895518
AB  - The concept of resilience gained traction in academic, policy, and development discourse in recent years, yet its conceptualization and application at the farm level has received little attention. For instance, recent policy recommendations present farm resilience as a silver bullet in dealing with agricultural risks and uncertainty, and in achieving sustainable agri-food systems. Yet, the question of what determines farm resilience in a smallholder farming set-up remains fuzzy. To address this knowledge gap, we firstly develop a novel conceptual framework based on determinants of farm resilience and farmer adaptive capacity as a pathway through which farm resilience is strengthened. The emphasis on adaptive capacity responds to a conceptual weakness inherent in studies that present socio-ecological systems as static systems. Secondly, based on a literature review, we propose mechanisms through which farmer entrepreneurship, membership in farmer organization, and farmer–buyer relationships may influence farmer adaptive capacity and thereby farm resilience. Based on our conceptual understanding of the determinants of farm resilience, we recommend approaches that augment farmer entrepreneurship, support farmer organizations, and strengthen farmer–buyer relationships.

T1  - Impact of Participation in Contract Farming on Smallholder Farmers’ Income and Food Security in Rural Benin: PSM and LATE Parameter Combined
AN  - 2443895377
AB  - Investigated in this work is the impact of contract farming participation on smallholder farmers’ income and food security in rice crop production in Northern Benin using 400 randomly selected rice farmer households. Unlike previous studies, we corrected for both observed and unobserved biases by combining propensity score matching (PSM) and the local average treatment effect parameter (LATE). The results showed significant negative consequences of partaking in rice contract farming. We found evidence of significant negative effects on rice production income at a 1% level. The more the rice farmers join in contract farming, the lower the farm income became. Decreased food consumption was also a result of contract farming participation for potential participants by a score of 60.64, placing their households at the food security status level of poor food consumption because the quantity and nutritional quality of the food consumed were inadequate. Contract farming is, therefore, not a reasonable policy instrument that can help farmers increase their income and improve their food security level in the Alibori Department, Benin if farmers do not diversify their crops. The necessary resources and economic environment are not yet in place to allow contract farming to take full advantage of its potential benefits. To prevent the wasting of scarce public resources, expanding contract farming would not be appropriate in marginal areas with markets and other infrastructure. Additional measures are needed for contract farming to be profitable for contracting actors and to ensure sustainability and the large-scale participation of farmers.

T1  - Business Models and Innovation in the Indonesian Smallholder Beef Value Chain
AN  - 2439627963
AB  - This paper proposes a framework for identification of business models in smallholder cattle production and marketing that represents innovation behaviour. Cattle are vital to Indonesia’s smallholders’ livelihoods, and smallholder systems are key to serving the country’s growing demand for beef. Business incentives currently select against the development and sustainability of breeding systems which would support domestic production, and so new models are needed which utilize innovation. The three primary components of a business model are presented: its value proposition, its value architecture, and its financing mechanism. A research approach is provided, by way of mapping data needs to the business models, and proposing relationships between observed innovation practices and the business models within the value chain. For implementation, the paper provides guidance on facilitation needs and the role of stakeholders in the case of the Indonesian cattle and beef value chain.

T1  - Climate Change Adaptation, Food Security, and Attitudes toward Risk among Smallholder Coffee Farmers in Nicaragua
AN  - 2438573391
AB  - Farmers’ livelihoods are uniquely vulnerable to climate change, and taking adaptive measures to changing environmental conditions constitutes one of the most important pathways for protecting them. Their willingness and capacity to adopt improved practices and technologies, their cognitive and behavioural preferences, and the institutional response mechanisms will go a long way in determining their success in their adaptation to climate change. This study presents results of an analysis of the vulnerabilities of smallholder coffee producers in Nicaragua to climate change. I use descriptive analyses and experimental risk games to evaluate the preferences and attitudes of coffee producers in the context of their adaptation to climate change. I show that food insecure households are more risk-averse than food-secure households and that much work is needed in the sector to ensure equity and improve institutional capacity. For households in chronic poverty, conventional risk management strategies simply may not be enough. Institutional arrangements must be put in place to enable coffee-growing households to engage in practices that result in improved capacity for climate change adaptation.

T1  - Analyzing Pathways of Nurturing Informal Seed Production into Formal Private Ventures for Sustainable Seed Delivery and Crop Productivity: Experiences from Ethiopia
AN  - 2437323496
AB  - Sustaining crop production and productivity in sub-Saharan Africa requires the availability and use of quality seed of improved varieties by smallholder farmers. The private sector has been considered as the best way to sustain seed supply and crop productivity. Unfortunately, the private sector’s share in the seed production and delivery in sub-Saharan Africa countries has not been very substantial for decades. As a consequence, farmer access to quality seed of recently released varieties remains very low. This manuscript analyzes the experiences of informal seed producers who graduated to formal private seed enterprises to understand the effectiveness of the support they receive to become viable seed ventures. We used comparative research methods to analyze the qualitative and quantitative data collected to understand the underlying mechanisms. The findings showed that the analyzed seed enterprises started with as little as about USD 300 and have already multiplied over tenfold their initial capital. They benefited from a wide variety of supports, e.g., quality seed production, marketing, partnerships, and value chain development trainings and infrastructures, from extension workers, research centers, national and international NGOs, and the other private seed enterprise operators like large public seed enterprises and agro-dealers. The seed enterprises are producing pre-basic, basic, and certified seed of cereals and self-pollinated legume crops delivered directly to farmers, institutional markets, and agro-dealers. The seed production data have been increasing for the past three years with an area expanding from about 30 ha to over 150 ha per year for chickpea. The seed production and delivery practices being employed are smallholder farmer-based practices that are environmentally friendly. For sustainable and reliable seed production and delivery systems in sub-Saharan Africa, a bold step is needed whereby the informal seed production entities are nurtured and upgraded into formal certified seed production ventures that deliver social and economic benefits to the promotors and the communities.

T1  - Smallholder Agricultural Investment and Productivity under Contract Farming and Customary Tenure System: A Malawian Perspective
AN  - 2436313784
AB  - Land tenure security, especially customary residence systems, is found to influence the agricultural investment decision-making and productivity of smallholder farmers across sub-Saharan Africa. However, as country-specific customary residence systems and farming models evolve over time, their impact on food security and livelihood remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of customary residence systems on both agricultural investment (in tea shrubs and agroforestry) and productivity among contracted smallholder tea outgrowers in Southern Malawi. A survey of 228 farmers was conducted in 2018, and a linear probability and ordinary least squared (OLS) models were used for the analysis. The results suggest that matrilocal residence practices positively influence agricultural investment. The study concluded that despite the dominance of matrilineal-matrilocal systems in Southern Malawi, there is a need for policy to address gender gaps in the region because women are still vulnerable and insecure even in these assumed women-friendly customary systems. It is recommended that future research explores other prevailing tenure security systems.

T1  - A Game-Based Approach to Exploring Gender Differences in Smallholder Decisions to Change Farming Practices: White Rice Production in Laos
AN  - 2435090465
AB  - What influences farmers’ decisions to adopt agricultural technologies is an important question for international agricultural research projects. There are often interpersonal differences between women and men that influence the adoption of decisions and behaviours, but few studies in the literature focus on these factors. We describe a game-based approach to explore decision-making processes underpinning the adoption of new farming technologies and practices in Lao People’s Democratic Republic. Sowing a different rice variety is the tailored technology. The game explored adoption behaviours influencing decisions on transitioning from growing glutinous rice, a traditional variety preferred for consumption, to “white” rice for commercial export to international markets. We conducted separate game-workshops with 36 women and 36 men in 4 villages of southern Laos that were transitioning from subsistence to commercial smallholder production. The gaming exposed various possible behaviours and decisions that women and men considered. Access to resources, both assets and information, was equal for all players, yet women were found to adopt new rice varieties more readily than men and to engage in cooperative behaviours in the game situation. The study highlighted the need for further gender-sensitive research into cooperation among women in the agricultural context—an understanding beneficial for countries and regions undergoing agricultural transition.

T1  - Coffee farmers' incentives to comply with sustainability standards
TT  - Coffee farmers' incentives
AN  - 2427989733
AB  - PurposeThis paper investigates the incentives to coffee farmers to participate in certification schemes that require improved agricultural practices.Design/methodology/approachThe authors ran a choice experiment among 250 Brazilian coffee farmers in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil.FindingsThe authors’ findings show that both cash and non-cash payments are likely to incentive farmers' participation in a certification scheme. Besides price premium, incentives as long-term contracts and provision of technical would encourage producers to adopt eco-certification schemes. Our results also suggest that non-cash payments may be appropriate substitutes to a price premium to some extent.Research limitations/implicationsThe large coffee producers are over-represented in our sample compared to the population of Brazilian coffee farms. However, it seems reasonable to focus on these producers, as they are usually the ones who individually adopt strategies, since small farmers are induced by collective strategies (e.g. cooperatives).Social implicationsThe result regarding technical assistance makes sense given that Brazilian farmers generally have poor access to rural extension services.Originality/valueWe contributed in the literature about adoption of sustainable agriculture practices analyzing the requirements and motivations for farmer participation in certification schemes. We also contribute private and public strategies to encourage the adoption of sustainable practices.

T1  - Limitations of Inclusive Agribusiness in Contributing to Food and Nutrition Security in a Smallholder Community. A Case of Mango Initiative in Makueni County, Kenya
AN  - 2422938122
AB  - Food and nutrition security remain at the top of development priorities in low income countries. This is especially the case for smallholder farmers who derive their livelihood from agriculture yet are often the most deprived. Inclusive agribusinesses have been championed as a key strategy to address local constraints that limit smallholders’ participation in regional and global value chains, thereby enhancing their livelihood, and food and nutrition security, accordingly. In this paper, based on a mixed method research approach, we explore the potential food and security contribution of inclusive agribusiness in Makueni county, Kenya. We focus on the smallholders’ constraints and needs, exploring the extent to which these are addressed by such purported pro-poor approach. First, using independent sample t-tests and a probit regression model, we explore who are able to participate in an ongoing intervention. We compare how participants and non-participants differ in terms of key socio-economic characteristics and establish which of these attributes are associated with successful integration into the business. Second, we again use independent sample t-tests to determine how the participants and non-participants compare in terms of their food and nutrition security. The household food and nutrition security is assessed with the conventional measurement tools: the household food insecurity access scale and the household food dietary diversity score. We find that participation in the inclusive agribusiness favors smallholder households with relatively higher production capacity in terms of better physical capital (land and number of mango trees, financial capital), access to loans, and human capital (age, education, and family size). Following income improvement, the participants’ household food security situation is significantly better than for non-participants. However, participation does not improve household dietary diversity, implying that improvement in income does not necessarily lead to better household nutrition security. To address the limitations of inclusive agribusiness, we propose policymakers and development actors to critically explore the contextual background prior to intervention design and implementation, and accordingly devise a broader approach for more inclusivity of the very poor and marginalized, and better food and nutrition security outcomes as a result. Given that not every smallholder could benefit from inclusive agribusiness for their food needs due to resource scarcity, alternative livelihood supports, including social protection programs and safety net plans, should be considered.

T1  - The Resilience of Smallholder Livestock Farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Risks Imbedded in Rural Livestock Systems
AN  - 2421599633
AB  - Smallholder livestock farmers (SLF) are important in research and policy development agenda because of the everlasting issue of food insecurity and the livelihoods in sub-Sahara Africa. Lack of access to technologies and information, poor infrastructure and lack of access to markets and environmental factors play a key role in deterring sustainable smallholder livestock farming. In recent years, studies have provided evidence that livestock species can play a role towards solving household food insecurity and enhancing Africa’s resilient livelihoods, particularly in rural settings. However, no studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of emerging technologies (available information technologies) as risk mitigation tools for smallholder livestock farmers. The study used survey data from 278 interviewer-administered questionnaires and 13 in-depth interviews village herds from Dumba, Mapayi, Old Nuli and Shabwe to explore whether rural SLF would use the emerging technologies to enhance their operations, and mitigate supply chain risk, exposures to stock theft and loss. Empirical results show the overwhelming need for the use of emerging technologies by the SLF, and that emerging technologies have significant and positive effects on the risk management activities. SLF indicated that, using digital technologies, they could enhance their risk mitigation and value chains. The results of the study have several policy implications. For instance, the agricultural comparative advantage should be improved through various emerging agricultural technologies. Moreover, the immediate rural development service networks for SLF could be strengthened through the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform to reduce livestock risk exposures, disasters and market reactions. Although rural livestock farming in Beitbridge has survived over the years at a subsistence level, the paper provides some interesting and pertinent findings, and projects some possible future research pathways.

T1  - Dynamics of the Fertilizer Value Chain in Mozambique
AN  - 2412676410
AB  - Mozambique is characterized by low agricultural productivity, which is associated with low use of yield-enhancing agricultural inputs. Fertilizer application rate averaged 5.7 kg ha−1 in Mozambique during the period 2006 to 2015, considerably low by regional targets, yet constraints that affect fertilizer use have not been thoroughly investigated. This study examined the constraints on fertilizer value chains in Mozambique to contribute to fertilizer supply chain strengthening. We used a combination of multivariate analysis and descriptive methods. Our findings indicate that fertilizer use has both demand and supply constraints. Key demand-side constraints include liquidity challenges, limited awareness about the benefits of using fertilizer, and low market participation, while the main supply-side constraints include high transaction costs, limited access to finance, and lack of soil testing results and corresponding fertilizer recommendations by soil type and crop uptake. These results suggest that scaling up the input subsidy program through vouchers (either paper-based vouchers or e-vouchers) with demonstration plots and effective targeting could drive up smallholders’ demand for fertilizer and fertilizer supply by strengthening a sustainable network of wholesalers and retailers. This would likely boost agricultural productivity.

T1  - Making Smallholder Value Chain Partnerships Inclusive: Exploring Digital Farm Monitoring through Farmer Friendly Smartphone Platforms
AN  - 2410617757
AB  - Value chain partnerships face difficulties achieving inclusive relations, often leading to unsustainable collaboration. Improving information flow between actors has been argued to contribute positively to a sense of inclusion in such partnership arrangements. Smallholders however usually lack the capability to use advanced communication technologies such as smartphones which offer a means for elaborate forms of information exchange. This study explores to what extent co-designing smartphone platforms with smallholders for farm monitoring contributes to smallholder ability to communicate, and how this influences smallholder sense of inclusion. The study uses an Action Design Research approach in engaging smallholders in Ghana, through multi-stakeholder and focus group discussions, in a reflexive co-design process. The research finds that co-designing a platform interface was significant in improving farmer ability to comprehend and use smartphone based platforms for communicating farm conditions and their needs with value chain partners. Farmers were however skeptical of making demands based on the platform due to their lack of power and mistrust of other actors. This highlights a need for adjusting the social and political dimensions of partnership interactions, in tandem with the advancement of digital tools, in order to effectively facilitate a sense of inclusiveness in partnerships.

T1  - The Key Factors Affecting Tree Producer Associations Involved in Private Commercial Forestry in Kenya
AN  - 2404251254
AB  - Formal tree producer associations are critical for the sustainable management of private commercial farm forests in Kenya. However, there is limited information on their current status and the key factors driving their operations in the country. This paper sought to address this informational gap by reviewing the existing literature in the country from the theoretical background of sustainable development and later validating the obtained findings with the current state of knowledge at regional and global levels. Results from document content analysis indicate that there are over 10,000 tree growing farmers organized into planting groups across the country after many years of piloting by the government and private sector players. At the national level, there are two associations. These include Kenya Forest Growers Association (KEFGA), mainly composed of large scale planters, and Farm Forestry Smallholder Producers Association of Kenya (FFSPAK), targeting small-holders. Besides these two, six major sub-national associations are seeking to improve members’ welfare by enhancing the acquisition of livelihood assets. Further, various socio-cultural, economic, and political factors affect their operations in Kenya. These associations have deployed multiple strategies to benefit their members. However, the formation of savings and credit cooperative societies (SACCOs) seems to be their preferred mode of community empowerment. In conclusion, even though these associations are still at the infancy stage, their future remains promising in-view of the observed behavioral change in their governance, which appears to favor entrenched equality and equity towards sustainable development.

T1  - INTEGRATING FARMERS' RIGHT TO TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURAL KNOWLEDGE INTO MALAYSIA PLANT VARIETY LAW
AN  - 2393114661
AB  - Lauded as stewards of agricultural biodiversity, successive generations of farmers have engaged in collective systems of conservation and innovation in improving crops since the earliest plant domestications. Their ancestral knowledge and practices have witnessed the sharing of the reproductive material between them since thereon. Modern agricultural expansion and development have contributed to the flow of crops globally. Intellectual property rights in the agricultural field such as patents and plant breeders' right, to a certain extent have affected these traditional agricultural practises of the farmers. Nonetheless in many parts of the world, where small farming communities still form an integral part of their food production chain, farmers ' traditional farming practices and knowledge are still widely used. This paper argues that over reliance on modern system of agricultural and intellectual property rights in the long run might threaten these small farmers' communities and suggest that the Farmers' Rights concept as enshrined in the FAO Treaty 2004 should be integrated into national legislations affecting farmers. Applying doctrinal analysis on existing plant variety law in Malaysia, this article investigates the extent to which the concept of Farmers' Rights to their traditional agricultural practices has been incorporated into the law. By way of comparison with the practices in India, a country quoted as having best practices in implementing Farmers' Right, the paper attempt to suggest on the possible way to integrate their practices into the Malaysia plant variety law.

T1  - Post-harvest groundnut aflatoxin management among smallholder farmers in Malawi
AN  - 2350301600
AB  - Aflatoxin contamination in groundnut production negatively affects health and trade outcomes. Aflatoxin contamination can occur at any stage along the groundnut value chain. However, the stage immediately after harvest has proven to be the most critical stage in aflatoxin management. This study presents knowledge, perceptions and practices in aflatoxin management during groundnut drying and storage among smallholder farmers in Malawi. Using probability proportionate to size random sampling techniques, the study sampled 150 smallholder farmers from three districts in the Central Region of Malawi namely Lilongwe, Mchinji and Kasungu. Descriptive analysis of results indicates that 90% of farmers harvest groundnuts at the right maturity. Results also showed that 59% farmers prefer drying groundnuts inverted in circular patches while 70% store groundnuts in polyethylene sacks on racks. Further, the study found that 97% of the farmers in the sample are aware of aflatoxin contamination but only 28% were able to identify the effects of aflatoxin contamination. These findings have implications in the design of postharvest intervention strategies on management and control of aflatoxin in groundnuts.

T1  - Quality Improvement in African Food Supply Chains: Determinants of Farmer Performance
AN  - 2350180465
AB  - The integration of smallholders in modern value chains in sub-Saharan Africa is an important pathway for improving income and farmer livelihoods. Connected to demographic shifts, rapid urbanization, and the emergence of a middle class, there is a demand for higher product quality. In order to access these modern markets, smallholders need to enhance the quality of their products. However, factors that determine smallholders’ decision to invest in quality upgrading are not well understood. Using cross-sectional data from the Ethiopian barley sector, we analyse the factors that explain smallholders’ decision to improve quality. We find that socioeconomic, institutional and market factors affect the decision to improve quality. Our study contributes to the understanding of the determinants of quality upgrading at the micro-level of the economics of quality production, and thus of rural development.

T1  - Socio‐economic differentiation from a class‐analytic perspective: The case of smallholder tree‐crop farmers in Limpopo, South Africa
AN  - 2322581847
AB  - South African agrarian policy aims to integrate smallholder tree‐crop farmers into high‐end value chains with growth and employment potential, generally neglecting socio‐economic differentiation amongst them. This paper aims to analyse socio‐economic differentiation amongst tree‐crop farmers in Vhembe District, Limpopo, using a class‐based analysis based on livelihood diversification and accumulation. Cluster analysis of survey data and semi‐structured interviews reveals that most tree‐crop farmers engage in petty commodity production, internally differentiated by their combination of income sources and livelihood strategies. Farmers' ability to engage in accumulation and upward class mobility is generally severely constrained by limited access to capital. Agricultural diversification offers livelihood potential but limited possibility for accumulation, whereas salaried nonfarm work offers more promising prospects for accumulation but limited livelihood opportunities. A minority demonstrated characteristics of small‐scale capitalist farmers, internally differentiated by their reliance on salaried employment or agricultural production. The findings challenge the notion of an undifferentiated class of market‐oriented smallholders.

T1  - Collective influence of household and community capitals on agricultural employment as a measure of rural poverty in the Mahanadi Delta, India
AN  - 2189243985
AB  - The main determinants of agricultural employment are related to households’ access to private assets and the influence of inherited social–economic stratification and power relationships. However, despite the recommendations of rural studies which have shown the importance of multilevel approaches to rural poverty, very few studies have explored quantitatively the effects of common-pool resources and household livelihood capitals on agricultural employment. Understanding the influence of access to both common-pool resources and private assets on rural livelihoods can enrich our understanding of the drivers of rural poverty in agrarian societies, which is central to achieving sustainable development pathways. Based on a participatory assessment conducted in rural communities in India, this paper differentiates two levels of livelihood capitals (household capitals and community capitals) and quantifies them using national census data and remotely sensed satellite sensor data. We characterise the effects of these two levels of livelihood capitals on precarious agricultural employment by using multilevel logistic regression. Our study brings a new perspective on livelihood studies and rural economics by demonstrating that common-pool resources and private assets do not have the same effect on agricultural livelihoods. It identifies that a lack of access to human, financial and social capitals at the household level increases the levels of precarious agricultural employment, such as daily-wage agricultural labour. Households located in communities with greater access to collective natural capital are less likely to be agricultural labourers. The statistical models also show that proximity to rural centres and access to financial infrastructures increase the likelihood of being a landless agricultural labourer. These findings suggest that investment in rural infrastructure might increase livelihood vulnerability, if not accompanied by an improvement in the provisioning of complementary rural services, such as access to rural finance, and by the implementation of agricultural tenancy laws to protect smallholders’ productive assets.

T1  - A new sustainability model for measuring changes in power and access in global commodity chains: through a smallholder lens
AN  - 2792279472
AB  - High-value agricultural commodities face substantial economic, environmental and social sustainability challenges. As a result, commodity industries are adopting sustainable supply- and value-chain models to make production more efficient, traceable and risk-averse. These top-down models often focus on giving higher prices to smallholder producers. While an important component of sustainability, this focus on farm-gate prices has shown mixed results in part because they are less effective in highlighting the asymmetrical power relationships and the socio-economic and ecological complexity in high-value commodity production. Here, we use a novel method to measure and visualise changes in smallholder power in Madagascar’s northeast ‘vanilla triangle’—home to about 80% of the world’s high quality vanilla. Our results reveal the paradox that during the recent price surge an overall increase in smallholders’ multi-dimensional power to access economic benefits was accompanied by a decrease in many other equally important measures of sustainability. This illustrates how effective models for understanding global sustainable commodity chains should incorporate smallholders' perspectives that often emphasise complexity and uncertainty, and which aims to increase power and access for producers across both high and low price points.

T1  - Material flow analysis for energy potential in coffee production
AN  - 2558250921
AB  - Agricultural waste has the potential of biomass as a raw material for producing renewable energy. The primary processing of coffee produces waste from pulping and hulling activities. Waste can be processed further through composting, anaerobic water waste treatment and burning to be converted into electrical energy. Therefore, the calculation is needed that estimates the amount of potential biomass that is converted. Then, the purpose of the paper is to analyze each stage in the life cycle of Gayo Arabica coffee and calculate the potential amount of electrical energy produced. The life cycle assessment method uses material and energy analysis intending to explain the flow of inputs and outputs within the system boundary and analyze the movement and transformation of materials, energy, waste, and emissions. In the context of the paper, the study uses material flow analysis to estimate the biomass potential from solid and water waste treatment. The study uses interviews, observations and a cooperative report located in Central Aceh district as an Arabica coffee producer area in Indonesia. Production of Arabica coffee is managed by cooperatives involving small farmers and collectors from cultivation, primary processing, packaging, and delivery. Cultivation uses the agroforestry system with a shade tree of the type of lamtoro (Leucaena leucocephala). Packing with a pack of burlap is done by the cooperative. Activities undertaken cooperatives include the acceptance of coffee beans from the collector. Since 2016 cooperatives implemented a policy of processing coffee beans at the collector level. The estimation of the study shows that waste treatment through anaerobic water waste treatment, composting and combustion from 1 ton of cherry coffee (primary processing) has an energy potential of 34 kwh.

T1  - The economic geography of Kenyan tobacco farmers’ livelihood decisions
AN  - 2431944822; 2020-03530-019
AB  - Introduction: The narrative of prosperous economic livelihood of tobacco farmers in Kenya as alleged by the tobacco industry deserves challenge as evidence increasingly suggests that smallholder tobacco farmers are making little or no profits. Article 17 of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control encourages viable alternative livelihoods for tobacco farmers. There is little evidence, however, on how tobacco farmers make livelihood choice decisions. Methods: A total of 527 purposefully selected smallholder tobacco farmers in Kenya from three main tobacco-growing regions participated in a 2017 economic livelihood survey. Geo-economic data were matched to surveyed farmers’ Global Positioning System coordinates to estimate each farmer’s access to nearby economic centers. Ownership of cell phones or radios was also used to estimate farmers’ virtual access to nearby economic activities to understand better the role of information. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to control socioeconomic status and self-reported activity in nearby economic centers. Results: Tobacco farmers rarely live within 10 km of an economic center. Results suggest that the further away farmers live from economic centers, the less likely they are to grow tobacco, but more likely to grow tobacco under contract. Also, farmers owning a cell phone or radio are not only less likely to grow tobacco, but also to not engage in farming under contract if they do grow tobacco. Conclusions: Physical and virtual access to nearby economic activities is significantly associated with tobacco farmers’ livelihood choice decision and should be taken into consideration by decision makers while developing interventions for FCTC Article 17. Implications: Smallholder tobacco farmers in lower-income countries are making little or no profits, but few studies have been conducted to illuminate what perpetuates tobacco production, with such studies urgently needed to support governments to develop viable alternative livelihoods for tobacco farmers. This study suggests that geographic and technological factors that shape farmers’ economic decisions can help policy makers tailor alternative livelihood policies to different regional contexts and should be a focus of future research in this area.

T1  - Improving the Training of Frontline Extension Workers in Tanzania: A Pilot Curriculum Reform Initiative with the Ministry of Agriculture Training Institute at Ilonga
AN  - 2330967366
AB  - Promoting the transition of smallholder farmers from subsistence to more commercial and market-oriented production is an important goal of the Tanzanian extension system. The Ministry of Agriculture Training Institutes (MATIs) contribute to this goal by providing training to frontline extension workers (FEWs). However, the capacity of the MATI system to produce agricultural extension practitioners with job-ready competencies has declined, leading stakeholders and employers to raise concerns about the quality and training of FEWs. The main purpose of this study was to develop recommendations for curriculum revisions at MATI Ilonga to improve its program of study. This was done using a competency-based approach that incorporated inputs from stakeholders into the curriculum assessment and revision process. A panel of eight local and external experts derived 23 competencies from a review of the MATI curriculum and extension literature. A survey instrument to assess competencies based on perceptions of importance and graduates' ability was designed and administered to 189 stakeholders from four stakeholder groups. Stakeholder-respondents considered all but two of the 23 competencies to be very high importance. Weighted discrepancy scores indicated that the highest rated areas for curriculum revision were Value Chains, Business skills, Climate Change, Fisheries, and Land Resource Management. All stakeholder groups except graduates, indicated Value Chains and Business Skills as high priorities requiring enhanced training to improve the ability of FEWs. Follow-up stakeholder consultations indicated support for using the competency-based approach, engaging stakeholders in the curriculum review process, and interest in applying the approach with other MATIs in Tanzania.

T1  - Rural Azerbaijan through Quantitative and Qualitative Research Lenses: Debating the Transition to Small Farm Capitalism
AN  - 2322043426
AB  - This article examines agrarian relations in post‐Soviet Azerbaijan after redistributive land reforms. We argue that the reforms failed to establish small‐farm capitalism on former collective and state farm land. Commodity production in rural Azerbaijan is characterized by increasing concentration of land and capital, and the recipients of the privatized land shares procure livelihoods not through commercial farming, but through a combination of strategies—including wages, remittances from migrant relatives, and subsistence agriculture. This study is based on the combination of state statistics, government reports, and local ethnography—in‐depth interviews with land reform administrators and with rural residents in six diverse villages from two distinct regions of Azerbaijan. Previous studies of post‐Soviet transition in rural Azerbaijan reported different results of the land reforms. A quantitative account based on the state statistics reported a postreform countryside where small farmers, former collective and state laborers, live off their privatized land shares and increase agricultural productivity. A qualitative account based on local ethnography suggested that the privatized land shares play a marginal role in the livelihoods of local residents. We show how the discrepancy is illusory and stems from an erroneous, legal definition of “small farms” used in the state statistics, which conflates socially distinct categories of land use. When the statistical terms are put into their social context, the quantitative data confirm the qualitative findings.

T1  - Money Well Spent? Operations, Mainstreaming, and Fairness of Fair Trade
AN  - 2321261897
AB  - We examine the operations, fairness, and social implications of fair trade certified products. We consider the market for fair trade certified products, which may serve as a substitute to a regular product. A fair trade organization chooses standards for the certification, namely, the (unit) premium and minimum fraction of fair trade raw materials, to maximize the total premium transferred to farmers. We analyze the operations of various stakeholders in the fair trade value chain, as well as the role and social welfare of fair trade organizations with different philosophies. We characterize the firms’ entry decision in the fair trade market as well as the resulting market equilibrium. Furthermore, we examine the impact of mainstreaming, i.e., whether to allow large‐scale plantations (often owned by large corporates) to be eligible for fair trade certification or not, which is one of the most discussed topics in the fair trade movement. We also identify the welfare allocation among various stakeholders in the value chain under different certification policies, and thereby address the fairness issue of the fair trade market as well as its resulting social welfare implications. Finally, we obtain a number of policy insights and suggestions to support this nascent marketplace.

T1  - European Union non-tariff barriers to imports of African biofuels
AN  - 2315446911
AB  - The introduction of EU mandates for biofuel use in the transport sector initially led to high expectations that African countries would benefit from biofuel exports to the EU. This market opportunity has not been realised, however, due to regulatory requirements for the production of biofuels that act as non-tariff barriers to the acceptance of African biofuels in the EU. This benefits producers of biofuel crops and processors in the EU by providing economic protection. In particular, the EU import regime fails to acknowledge the challenges faced by African (or other) developing countries in satisfying the requirements.Using a computable general equilibrium model for Malawi, we quantify the foregone potential benefits from biofuel production for exports to the EU arising from non-tariff barriers (NTBs) embedded in the sustainability criteria. Our results show that sugarcane-ethanol production under smallholder outgrower regimes would lead to both economic growth outcomes and rural development, whereas jatropha-biodiesel fails to increase rural incomes due to low profitability. While there is widespread agreement on the latter today, our study is the first to explore the failure of jatropha in Malawi in an economy-wide framework. The ethanol results, however, also hold if land clearing is forbidden, thereby preserving biodiversity as stipulated under the sustainability criteria in the EU Renewable Energy Directive. The EU NTBs embedded in the Renewable Energy Directive thus play a much larger role for countries in Sub-Sahara Africa than simply inhibiting investment opportunities and should be refashioned to lower the entry costs for developing countries.

T1  - Value Chain Approaches in a Stagnant Industry: The Case of Furniture Production in Jepara, Indonesia
AN  - 2315446780
AB  - This article assesses impacts of the Jepara Furniture Value Chain (FVC) project, which was intended to address challenges faced by small-scale furniture producers in Jepara, Indonesia. The assessment focuses on the effects of membership in the Jepara Small-Scale Furniture Producers Association (APKJ), a body started as part of the FVC project. Propensity score matching was used to compare differences in outcome variables between association members and matched non-members. A limited, positive impact of APKJ membership was found. Members improved their marketing, allowing them to retain more value than non-members. APKJ members were also more likely to have obtained certificates of timber legality. However, APKJ membership did not significantly affect firm profit and there was little evidence of an industry transformation. The paper also critiques the indiscriminate use of a value chain approach.

T1  - A new sustainability model for measuring changes in power and access in global commodity chains: through a smallholder lens
AN  - 2272765261
AB  - High-value agricultural commodities face substantial economic, environmental and social sustainability challenges. As a result, commodity industries are adopting sustainable supply- and value-chain models to make production more efficient, traceable and risk-averse. These top-down models often focus on giving higher prices to smallholder producers. While an important component of sustainability, this focus on farm-gate prices has shown mixed results in part because they are less effective in highlighting the asymmetrical power relationships and the socio-economic and ecological complexity in high-value commodity production. Here, we use a novel method to measure and visualise changes in smallholder power in Madagascar’s northeast ‘vanilla triangle’—home to about 80% of the world’s high quality vanilla. Our results reveal the paradox that during the recent price surge an overall increase in smallholders’ multi-dimensional power to access economic benefits was accompanied by a decrease in many other equally important measures of sustainability. This illustrates how effective models for understanding global sustainable commodity chains should incorporate smallholders' perspectives that often emphasise complexity and uncertainty, and which aims to increase power and access for producers across both high and low price points.

T1  - “Small farmer large field”, a new model to developing and improving adoption of hybrid rice technology in Indonesia
AN  - 2558158970
AB  - At present, the international market prefers to rice with some specific characters such as long slender shape, soft with 22-24% amylose content, a high percentage of head rice, and also aromatic. To fulfill rice with export standard, the farmers who involve have to apply good agricultural practices (GAP). Therefore need a high yielding variety, one of those varieties is hybrid rice variety possessing long slender shape, soft, a high percentage of head rice, and aromatic. Small Farmers, Large Field (SFLF) scheme was assumed précised and local specific for low land rice cultivation. This concept was integrated for farmers with small land holding to increase benefit collectively. The concept also integrated all cultivation system starting from planting up to marketing which was done together by some stakes holders. The objectives of this study are to (1) identify the hybrid rice productivity in large scale, (2) verify and validate the development of hybrid rice technology in small farmer large field’s model, and (3) analyze the preference of farmers to hybrid rice varieties. The research activities consisted of SFLF approach by using hybrid rice varieties with Jarwo Super system in large scale. Adoption survey and preference test for the farmer in term of rice plant performance, quality of grain paddy and rice which was done simultaneously in subak Tajen, Penebel sub-district, Tabanan district, Bali province. Dem-farm was conducted at 50 ha with hybrid rice varieties from ICRR and private company. Average hybrid rice yield is about 7.5 ton/ha to 13.5 ton/ha. The results of participatory varietal selection showed that the yield potential, performance of the plant, tolerance to pest and disease, and quality of grain from hybrid rice varieties had a positive influence on farmers’ preference.

T1  - Upgrading the smallholder dairy value chain: a system dynamics ex-ante impact assessment in Tanzania's Kilosa district
AN  - 2323397153
AB  - Copyright © Hannah Dairy Research Foundation 20192019Hannah Dairy Research FoundationThis paper examines ex-ante impacts of two policy interventions that improve productivity of local-breed cows through artificial insemination (AI) and producers’ access to distant markets through a dairy market hub. The majority of cattle in Kilosa district in Tanzania are local low productivity breeds kept by smallholders and agro-pastoralists. Milk production is seasonal, which constrains producers’ access to distant urban markets, constrains producers’ incomes and restricts profitability in dairy processing. We developed and evaluated an integrated system dynamics (SD) simulation model that captures many relevant feedbacks between the biological dynamics of dairy cattle production, the economics of milk market access, and the impacts of rainfall as an environmental factor. Our analysis indicated that in the short (1 year) and medium (5-year) term, policy interventions have a negative effect on producers’ income due to high AI costs. However, in the long term (5+ years), producers’ income from dairy cattle activities markedly increases (by, on average, 7% per year). The results show the potential for upgrading the smallholder dairy value chain in Kilosa, but achievement of this result may require financial support to producers in the initial stages (first 5 years) of the interventions, particularly to offset AI costs, as well as additional consideration of post-farm value chain costs. Furthermore, institutional aspects of dairy market hub have substantial effects on trade-offs amongst performance measures (e.g. higher profit vs. milk consumption at producer's household) with gain in cumulative profit coming at the expense of a proportional and substantial reduction in home milk consumption.

T1  - The effects of agricultural cooperatives on smallholder livelihoods and agricultural performance in Cambodia
AN  - 2317548610
AB  - Cooperatives are increasingly advocated as a means to improve incomes, livelihoods and the sustainability of smallholder farmers. This study analyzes the impact of commercial vegetable cooperative membership on smallholder agricultural performance in Cambodia. Institutional heterogeneities are considered across cooperatives and various econometric techniques are used to control for potential selection bias. The impacts of horticulture on agricultural outcomes are also analyzed. The results indicate that membership of commercial vegetable cooperatives has so far had no effect on agricultural incomes or the value or amounts of agricultural inputs. However, results indicate that membership has affected technology choice, access to credit services and information transmission through technological training. Additionally, there is evidence that horticulture, as a component of overall agricultural diversification, can augment farm income. The results suggest that much of the benefit of cooperative membership stems from the cooperative's provision of services, which might not be easily inferred from measures of member incomes.

T1  - Do Farmer Professional Cooperatives Improve Technical Efficiency and Income? Evidence from Small Vegetable Farms in China
AN  - 2307420469
AB  - China’s small-scale agricultural producers face many challenges to increasing productivity and efficiency. In recent years, the Chinese government has provided support for farmer professional cooperatives (FPCs) to connect small farms with upstream and downstream processes in the food supply chain. This study combines propensity score matching and sample selection-corrected stochastic production frontier analysis to estimate the impacts of FPC participation by greenhouse vegetable producers on technical efficiency and income. Results indicate that FPCs help participants improve returns to scale and marginal returns to land and labor, increase technical efficiency, and obtain ¥4,460 (18%) greater income per greenhouse than nonparticipants.

T1  - Oil palm agroforestry: an alternative to enhance farmers’ livelihood resilience
AN  - 2557951451
AB  - Oil palm has been rapidly expanding in Indonesia and becoming an important export commodity for the country. However, oil palm production has been promoted only as a monoculture, and this has led to adverse impacts on natural and social systems. At the same time, the demand for oil palm products is likely to increase, and therefore there is an urgency to find alternatives for more sustainable oil palm production. We argue that the monoculture system is not necessarily to be the only way to produce oil palm and this article aims at analysing alternatives for oil palm production systems beyond monoculture with agroforestry as the main focus. We visited oil palm agroforestry practiced by smallholders in Jambi and Central Kalimantan and asked questions about their motivation in adopting agroforestry, farm management, value chain and institutions. We found that smallholders have various motivations in adopting oil palm agroforestry but improving their household resilience becomes the most prominent reason. The adoption of perennial species, oil palm and other crops in the farms may improve the diversity of the farms and thus the diversity of household income. However, smallholders encounter problems on productivity because of the competitions in spaces. Lack in the knowledge of species selection, quality of planting materials and spacing arrangement have influenced oil palm productivity. In addition, market access also becomes a crucial issue when their farms are located in remote areas. There is currently no institutions, both government and non-government which promote and facilitate the adoption of oil palm agroforestry although this system has been practiced especially by smallholders. We suggest that oil palm agroforestry system needs to be further investigated not only regarding financial benefits for the smallholders but also its social acceptability and barriers of adoption as well as its potentials in contributing to the improvement of ecosystem functions.

T1  - Constraints and opportunities in gender relations: Sugarcane outgrower schemes in Malawi
AN  - 2291409406
AB  - Contract farming (CF) is always and inherently a gendered process. This paper unveils the gender dynamics in resource access, use and labour control to show how outgrower CF induces changes, often contradictory engendering processes of production relations. It asks: How does CF influence gender relations in access to land, household labour relations and employment conditions (participation)? Relying on a detailed case study research of a sugarcane CF scheme in Malawi, we show that CF has a complex gendered impact on household's production relations. CF leads to a masculinization of farm management and ownership together with a feminization of labour. Nevertheless, women translate such labour provision into active participation in decision-making over the use of the cash returns from the CF for better outcome in the household. At the individual level, some can benefit from it; especially women who manage to engage in cane farming are able to attain financial independence and increase their bargaining power within their households. However, such benefits are reserved for households with access to land. Nevertheless, women engagement in cane farming coupled with increased gender awareness through NGOs sensitization is contributing to a change in gendered social perceptions and increased valuation of women abilities in commercial farming, their needs and contributions and may be modifying the gender balance at the community level. We demonstrate that empowering women by making them cane farmers alone is not enough to change women position within their communities, unless community members accompany such empowerment with the recognition and acknowledgement of the women's contribution. The finding suggests that combining active women participation in outgrower CF with authority enhancing programs through community education whilst creating the possibilities for women to take independent action may be a good way to improve the gender relations between men and women.

T1  - Peasant agency in Ghana's oil palm sector: The impact of multiple markets on food sovereignty
AN  - 2287035340
AB  - This paper contributes to the debate on peasant differentiation and market integration in the food sovereignty literature by examining the smallholder‐oriented oil palm sector in Ghana's eastern region. Against the background of loosening entry barriers in global value chains, and through an analysis of farmers' different positions in palm oil's multiple markets, we witness peasant‐like patterning of production and strategic market participation among well‐situated non‐contract farmers. We propose that such interface settings where commodity relations are present, but do not penetrate fully offer valuable entry points for revisiting the role of global markets in peasant reproduction in the Global South. We consequently argue the need to replace the idealized category of “peasant” with an analytical category that can recognize social differentiation and reproduction through partial engagement with commodity markets.

T1  - Using "theory of change" to improve agricultural research: recent experience from Tanzania
AN  - 2282709969
AB  - Demonstrating how agricultural research contributes to development outcomes is difficult but necessary given competing demands for scarce resources. This article summarises an adaptation of the "theory of change" approach and lessons derived from its application to improve the design and implementation of an agricultural research for development programme for greater impact. It was applied to Maziwa Zaidi, a programme that tested integrated interventions to catalyse the transformation of smallholder dairy value chains in Tanzania. Despite challenges, the approach was found useful for planning, communication, managing complexity, monitoring behavioural changes and deriving lessons to adapt future programme activities amid complexity and uncertainties.

T1  - Inclusiveness of contract farming along the vertical coordination continuum: Evidence from the Vietnamese rice sector
AN  - 2290111385
AB  - The Vietnamese government is currently attempting to upgrade rice value chains in the Mekong River Delta by encouraging (i) vertical coordination between exporters and farmers through contract farming, and (ii) horizontal coordination among farmers through the "small farmers, large field" program. Previous studies on the determinants of contract farming participation assume that firms offer only a single contract type, whereas in reality, farmers may face a continuum of exclusive contract options. Devising correct and targeted policies for fostering contract inclusiveness hence crucially hinges on deploying correct econometric specification of the decision to participate in contract farming. We model contract farming participation and intensity in four different ways along the vertical coordination continuum: as a discrete, categorical, ordered, and continuous choice. We find that older, smaller and horizontally coordinated farmers with higher levels of trust in buyers tend to secure higher levels of buyer investment through increased vertical coordination. In contrast with the common finding in the literature that contract participation is biased towards larger farms, our findings from Vietnam suggest that the scale bias of contract farming could be successfully relaxed through horizontal coordination and even reversed under increasing levels of vertical coordination as smaller farmers are found to secure higher levels of buyer investment. These findings highlight the role both policies can play in fostering inclusiveness of contract farming in rice value chain upgrading in Vietnam.

T1  - Examining the social, physical and institutional determinants of pineapple farmers’ choice of production systems in Central Ghana
AN  - 2287866016
AB  - Various researchers have determined the different factors influencing farmers’ decisions to adopt certified organic production, without considering factors about the social and institutional environments of smallholder farmers in developing countries. In this paper, we examined the social, physical and institutional factors that affect farmers’ choice of production systems for pineapple in Ghana. A multinomial logit model was used to examine the factors influencing the pineapple farmers’ choice of a production system. Empirical findings indicate that apart from personal and attitudinal factors, the social, physical and institutional factors are also very important in individual farmer’s decisions to adopt certified organic production systems. Policy implications of these findings are that besides farmers’ personal and attitudinal characteristics, the social, physical and institutional features were also crucial in their decision to adopt certified organic production systems. The identified factors contribute to informing the government and other key players along the pineapple value chain on the elements to strive for when designing strategies and programmes to promote certified organic pineapple production. The study proposes that to encourage and sustain certified organic pineapple production systems, stakeholders in the pineapple sector should help farmers to consider the environmental sustainability in their production decision making and educate farmers on the potential cost and benefits of certifying their products organically. Effective policy and strategy design should, therefore, consider these factors to improve the adoption rate from conventional to certified organic production systems.

T1  - Value Chain Development and the Agrarian Question: Actor Perspectives on Native Potato Production in the Highlands of Peru
AN  - 2287010220
AB  - Value chain development seeks to integrate smallholder farmers into competitive markets to promote economic and social development. This article, conceptually based on the agrarian question, considers how the perspectives of various value chain actors, with particular focus on smallholders, have important implications for the outcomes of these market‐oriented initiatives. Utilizing Long’s concept of social interface, we present a mixed‐methods case study that analyzes how smallholders, an NGO, and agrifood corporations, including PepsiCo, partnered to establish value chains for native potatoes in the Peruvian highlands. We find that a thorough understanding of the various perspectives held by value chain actors provides important insight into why value chain initiatives have divergent trajectories. Based on the findings, we conclude that accounting for how actors are responding to development initiatives and one another helps explain development outcomes and that therefore the agrarian question remains relevant in current agricultural development discourse and practice.

T1  - Inclusiveness revisited: Assessing inclusive businesses in South African agriculture
AN  - 2285046831
AB  - Inclusive businesses are complex partnerships between commercial entities and smallholders/low-income communities, to include the latter in commercial agricultural value chains. IBs offer income opportunities for both partners, but are also regarded as empowering the smallholders/communities. To date, IB inclusiveness has been assessed mainly through basic quantitative measurements. However, these measures neglect the complexities of the overall value creation process, and of the inclusion of the beneficiaries within this process. This paper aims at providing a more holistic methodology by assessing the level of inclusiveness based on four dimensions: ownership, voice, risk and reward. Case studies in South Africa show that inclusion of low-income communities lags behind the intended level. Lack of financial resources and skills, reinforced by power imbalance, result in smallholder ownership being limited to land, the community's voice being compromised, risk being transferred to the smallholder communities and rewards being disappointing for the beneficiaries.

T1  - Declining Food Security in a Philippine Oil Palm Frontier: The Changing Role of Cooperatives
AN  - 2284882116
AB  - The long‐held redistributive function of agricultural cooperatives — one of moral economy and poverty alleviation — has changed dramatically as they emerge as core brokers for agro‐industrial development in the so‐called ‘green economy’. This article examines the changing role of cooperatives involved in brokering oil palm production and its impact upon the food security and livelihoods of smallholders who labour in plantation regimes situated in historically uneven agrarian political economies. Findings show how, increasingly, cooperatives reinforce uneven agrarian social relations of production and exchange in which indigenous smallholders experience loss of land, poor wage labour conditions tinged with insecurity and prejudice, and mounting debt in an expanding oil palm complex. The article suggests that these changes in agrarian social relations negatively influence indigenous farmers’ food security pathways, with their access to and use of appropriate foods diminishing. It asserts that understanding the impacts of cooperatives on food security pathways requires a relational and situated analysis of livelihood change and agrarian relations in extractive frontiers.

T1  - Value‐Chains in the Andes: Upgrading for Ecuador's Blackberry Producers
AN  - 2269961493
AB  - We apply a value chain approach to examine how blackberry producers in Ecuador can improve production and marketing practices to obtain more favorable prices. Results show that general upgrading actions are associated with improved producer prices, and specific activities, such as seeking information from reputable sources can lead to substantial welfare improvements. The paper goes beyond most value chain studies which treat participation in a ‘modern’ value chain as a discrete state. Ecuador's blackberry industry is evolving incrementally with no clearly discernible ‘modern’ market chains. Instead, producers incrementally make improvements in multiple dimensions. Relatively low‐cost practices, many of which do not imply substantial risk or investment, are associated with price improvements. Obstacles to participation in incremental value chain upgrading activities are not insurmountable. In particular, scale of production is not a limiting factor: small‐scale producers are not precluded from adopting improved practices and they do not suffer in terms of price received.

T1  - A decade of Tropical Legumes projects: Development and adoption of improved varieties, creation of market‐demand to benefit smallholder farmers and empowerment of national programmes in sub‐Saharan Africa and South Asia
AN  - 2272632264
AB  - This article highlights 12 years (2007–2019) of research, achievements, lessons learned, challenges and gaps in discovery‐to‐delivery research in legumes emanating from three projects, collectively called Tropical Legumes (TL) with a total investment of about US$ 67 million funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. These projects were implemented by three CGIAR centres (ICRISAT, CIAT and IITA) together with 15 national agricultural research system partners in sub‐Saharan Africa and South Asia. The TL projects together with some of their precursors and complementary projects from other agencies, facilitated the development of 266 improved legume varieties and the production of about 497,901 tons of certified seeds of the target legume crops in the focus countries. The certified seeds have been planted on about 5.0 million ha by more than 25 million smallholder farmers in the 15 countries and beyond, producing about 6.1 million tons of grain worth US$ 3.2 billion. Furthermore, the projects also trained 52 next generation scientists that included 10 women, by supporting 34 Masters degrees and 18 PhD degrees.

T1  - Forging alliances: Coffee grower and chain leader partnerships to improve productivity and coffee quality in Papua New Guinea
AN  - 2272037452
AB  - Partnership discourse is making advances in development dialogue as a means to improve the livelihoods of the agrarian populace. In Papua New Guinea, productive partnerships flourished during the early growth of the coffee industry. After the demise of plantations and rural mills in the lead up to political independence, the support services that plantations used to provide to smallholders, including centralised processing, have ceased as have price incentives for quality. Consequently, smallholders began to produce coffee of inconsistent quality and their productivity has also declined. However, coffee value chain partnerships have the potential to reverse the present decline of coffee production and increase the productivity of coffee farmers and address the inconsistency and the supply of low‐grade coffee. Using two case studies of farmer cooperatives, we investigate collective action and also assess partnerships among present value chain actors. The case studies were supported with interviews of value chain actors to gain further insights into partnerships with farmer groups. This paper illustrates that through collective action and partnerships, coffee farmers can improve coffee production and quality, enhance governance systems in grower groups, attract community development services and diversify into other entrepreneurial activities.

T1  - Bayesian approach and extreme value theory in economic analysis of forestry projects
AN  - 2251695163
AB  - Reliable estimates of price and wood yield as well as the calculation of economic criteria that include uncertainty are necessary to make the decision-making process more robust when analysing a long-term activity such as forestry. Through extreme value theory EVT combined with Bayesian inference it is possible to predict probability densities for inputs used in economic evaluation criteria like wood yield and prices. With it, uncertainties regarding the inputs can be taken into account in the economic analysis, improving the way they are obtained. Therefore, this study aimed to use Bayesian approach and EVT to estimate future price and yield to carry out an economic evaluation of a forestry project. Yield, maximum and minimum price were estimated in the form of probability density. Considering 95% of probability, the NPV calculated for the minimum price situation ranged from R$ 2050.11 to R$ 5409.07 ha−1, with a mean of R$ 3771.60 ha−1. The NPV calculated for the maximum price situation ranged from R$ 7766.77 to R$ 9070.29 ha−1, with a mean of R$ 8398.13 ha−1. These results serve as best and worst-case scenarios for managers in the case of a eucalyptus plantation established in 2017 under an outgrower scheme in Brazil. The presented methodology provided good results when estimating the variables of interest. It incorporates probability levels and/or prior information. With it, the economic performance of the project and its risks are better visualized and understood by researchers and managers.

T1  - Impacts of market-oriented agroforestry on farm income and food security: insights from Kavre and Lamjung districts of Nepal
AN  - 2071416600
AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing realization that improving market access for smallholders will lead to improvement in income and food security. However, market failure often limit smallholders’ fair access to market opportunities. To address this problem, a market-oriented agroforestry action research program was implemented in six sites of Kavre and Lamjung districts of Nepal between 2013 and 2016. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the changing impacts of the market-oriented agroforestry system on improving people’s livelihoods and addressing food security issues. The net-margin analysis of five priority products of agroforestry systems indicated that farmers benefitted most by a banana-based high yielding fodder system (56%) followed by Alnus-cardamom system (48%), tomato-fodder and buffalo (36%), chilli-fodder (26%) and ginger-based (25%) systems due to facilitation of market-oriented agroforestry action research services. The impact of market-oriented agroforestry intervention from a survey of 289 households, revealed that household income was increased by 37–48%, which can provide up to six additional months of food to the poorest households. This innovation has the potential to take the majority of households (63%) out of the poverty cycle while avoiding food shortage during the year. The implications of the study are that farmers must be united for collective marketing of their production and develop marketing strategies to eliminate middle men for better return. Some key lessons learned for the success of this research include farmers’ own motivation, favorable environment, and the inclusion of social activities and incentives for cultivating priority products species.

T1  - Are Technology Adoption and Collective Action Important in Accessing Credit? Evidence from Milk Producers in Tanzania
AN  - 2245944515
AB  - One of the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 2 is to double agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers through, among other things, improving access to financial services including credit. However, designing appropriate mechanisms for increasing access to credit by poor households remains a challenge, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper argues that technology adoption and collective action could provide pathways to enhancing access to credit. Evidence from milk-producing households in Tanzania suggests that group membership increases the probability of borrowing and the amount of funds borrowed by households, while adoption of artificial insemination increases the amount of funds borrowed. Two major conclusions are that public policy for increasing rural households’ access to credit should promote collective action, and that the likely increase in amount of funds demanded by households due to technology adoption and collective action will require policy to address issues pertaining to credit rationing of rural households.Alternate abstract:L’un des Objectifs du Développement Durable, l’objectif 2, est de doubler la productivité agricole ainsi que les revenus des petits producteurs de denrées alimentaires, notamment en améliorant l’accès aux services financiers, y compris les crédits. Toutefois, la conception de mécanismes appropriés pour accroître l’accès au crédit par les ménages pauvres demeure un défi, en particulier en Afrique subsaharienne. Cet article fait valoir que l’adoption de technologies et l’action collective pourraient fournir des pistes pour améliorer l’accès au crédit. Les données issues des ménages producteurs de lait en Tanzanie suggèrent que l’adhésion au groupe augmente la probabilité d’emprunt ainsi que le montant des fonds empruntés par les ménages, tandis que l’adoption de l’insémination artificielle augmente le montant des fonds empruntés. Deux grandes conclusions sont que la politique publique visant à accroître l’accès des ménages ruraux aux crédits devrait favoriser l’action collective, et l’augmentation probable des fonds réclamés par les ménages en raison de l’adoption de technologies et de l’action collective exigera des politiques pour résoudre les problèmes liés au rationnement du crédit des ménages ruraux.

T1  - How do development actors do “ICT for development”? A strategy‐as‐practice perspective on emerging practices in Ghanaian agriculture
AN  - 2235575654
AB  - This paper examines how development actors within the Ghanaian agricultural sector enact information and communication technology (ICT) in their day‐to‐day outreach practices with smallholder farmers. We draw on an in‐depth qualitative case study, informed by the theoretical perspective of “strategy‐as‐practice” to answer the research question: “what ICT‐mediated strategic practices are used by development actors in the Ghanaian agriculture sector?” The research findings reveal that (1) the activities of development actors are meshed within a network of interdependencies; (2) the enacted strategic practices reflect the trade‐off between novelty of content and novelty of the technologies used to deliver it; and lastly, (3) the praxis of development actors for doing ICT for development consists of hybrid strategies, combining bottom‐up approaches consistent with farmers' indigenous smallholder logic, with top‐down imperatives framing agriculture “as a business” and nurturing value‐chain integration. Consequently, our research points to the impact of ICT initiatives as step‐wise and attained over the long term, rather than disruptive and attained in the immediate term.

T1  - The Random Quantity Mechanism: Laboratory and Field Tests of a Novel Cost-Revealing Procurement Mechanism
AN  - 2195735949
AB  - Information on private costs can improve the efficiency of programs that provide payment for environmental services in contexts involving information asymmetries and heterogeneous private costs. Using data from laboratory and field experiments, this paper presents and evaluates a novel private cost revealing mechanism, termed the random quantity mechanism (RQM), that can advance research in conservation contracting, payments for environmental services, and other similar settings. We examine the RQM’s performance in a laboratory setting using induced costs and report results obtained from the first field implementation of this mechanism, with smallholder farmers in Zambia. We show that the RQM is incentive-compatible, that participant decision-making maximizes expected payoffs, and that the mechanism provides non-parametric estimates of private costs. The paper contributes to economic field studies by introducing a new incentive-compatible mechanism that elicits individuals’ minimum willingness to accept across intensive margins, enabling researchers to estimate the supply of a service or commodity, and provides for exogenous variation in contract terms, which can aid in separately identifying the impacts of incentives and of participants’ willingness to accept on contract outcomes.

T1  - Modelling trust and contractual arrangements in a local economy
AN  - 2212829694
AB  - This article investigates trust among dairy value-chain actors to understand the innovative process in a local productive sector in Tunisia. It uses a sample of 45 smallholder farmers chosen randomly nearby existing collection centres in the region. A trust variable is constructed employing 11 ordinal variables based on principal component analysis, and institutional arrangements then modelled to examine the effect of trust on contracting decisions and cooperative membership. The results show that trust is defined by values such as "integrity", "competence", and "existence of credible information", which are preconditions to sustainable contracts. The article contributes to the growing literature which considers social capital, networking and trust as determinants of farmer's behaviour, as opposed to the classical model of rationality.

T1  - Inequality regimes in Indonesian dairy cooperatives: understanding institutional barriers to gender equality
AN  - 2164908024
AB  - Women are important actors in smallholder farmer milk production. Therefore, female input in the dairy cooperatives is essential to dairy development in emerging economies. Within dairy value chains, however, their contributions are often not formally acknowledged or rewarded. This article contributes to filling this gap by adopting a multileveled institutional perspective to explore the case of dairy development in the Pangalengan mixed-sex dairy cooperative on West Java, Indonesia. The objective is to add evidence from the dairy development practice in Indonesia to the current agenda for gender and development as well as identify pathways for future research on dairy development that will help it do better in practice. Central to the exploration is a discussion of formal and informal institutions as part of the dynamics of the inequality regimes in dairy cooperatives. Evidence from dairy development practices in the Pangalengan cooperative shows, among others, distinct differences between the participation of male and female target groups in dairy development extension, as well as farm size- and resource-related trends in ‘masculinization’ and ‘feminization’ of the smallholder farmer household. The conclusions contribute to debates on more resilient, thus sustainable working relations in food chains, women’s empowerment, gender equality and social justice in agriculture as well as cooperative studies.

T1  - Compliance of smallholder timber value chains in East Java with Indonesia's timber legality verification system
AN  - 2216901700
AB  - The Indonesian Timber Legality Verification System (SVLK) has been developed primarily to address illegal logging in Indonesia, and is licensed under the European Union's Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan. While SVLK was catalysed by concerns about the legality of wood originating from natural forests, it applies to all wood production in Indonesia, including smallholders harvesting planted trees. This study investigates SVLK implementation in value chains originating from smallholder forests planted on private land in East Java Province, where these forests are important assets for both farmers and the forest industries. It follows value chains for two manufactured wood products, blockboard and plywood. There are specific SVLK requirements for each value chain actor, other than the market brokers in these chains. Results reveal the limitations of SVLK architecture in relation to smallholder value chains, variation in compliance practices, and points of ‘illegalisation’ and legalization within the value chains. The blockboard and plywood products from each case study chain claimed SVLK compliance. However, only one of the two case study chains for each product was compliant up to the blockboard or plywood manufacturing stage; and no distinction was made at this stage between SVLK-compliant and non-compliant wood. Consequently, none of the final products from any case study chain are SVLK-compliant. These results illustrate the challenges of designing and implementing timber legality systems for smallholder value chains, and suggest areas of focus to improve SVLK for smallholder value chains.

T1  - Costs, contracts and the narrative of prosperity: an economic analysis of smallholder tobacco farming livelihoods in Kenya
AN  - 2213035338
AB  - BackgroundThe tobacco industry has used the alleged negative impacts on economic livelihoods for tobacco farmers as a narrative to oppose tobacco control measures in low/middle-income countries. However, rigorous empirical evidence to support or refute this claim remains scarce. Accordingly, we assess how much money households earn from selling tobacco, and the costs they incur to produce the crop, including labour inputs. We also evaluate farmers’ decision to operate under contract directly with tobacco manufacturers and tobacco leaf-buying companies or to operate as independent farmers.MethodsA stratified random sampling method was used to implement a nationally representative household-level economic survey of 585 farmers across the three main tobacco growing regions in Kenya. The survey was augmented with focus group discussions in all three regions to refine and enrich the context of the findings.ResultsBoth contract and independent farmers experience small profit margins per acre, with contract farmers operating at a loss. Even when family labour is excluded from the calculation, income levels remain low, particularly considering the typically large households. Generally, tobacco farmers enter into contracts with tobacco companies because they have a ‘guaranteed’ buyer for their tobacco leaf and receive the necessary agricultural inputs (fertiliser, seeds, herbicides and so on) without paying cash up-front.ConclusionsTobacco farming households enter into contract with tobacco companies to realise perceived economic benefits. The narrative that tobacco farming is a lucrative economic undertaking for smallholder farmers, however, is inaccurate in the context of Kenya.

T1  - Human wellbeing outcomes of involvement in industrial crop production: Evidence from sugarcane, oil palm and jatropha sites in Ghana
AN  - 2444586568; 2019-24140-001
AB  - An extensive body of theoretical work has advocated the use of multiple human wellbeing indicators to assess the outcomes of agricultural investments in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). However, few studies have actually achieved it. This study investigates the human wellbeing outcomes of involvement in industrial crop production in Ghana by comparing the levels of different objective and subjective wellbeing measures for groups involved in industrial crop production as plantation workers and small holders, and groups not involved (i.e. control groups). We use household income, adult consumption and the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) as indicators of objective wellbeing. We measure subjective wellbeing through self-reported levels of satisfaction with life, worth whileness, happiness and anxiousness. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) analysis is used to assess whether involvement in industrial crop production increases household income and consumption. Overall, for most indicators of objective wellbeing industrial crop outgrowers, smallholders and independent smallholders are better off compared to other groups in their respective sites (in terms of mean scores), but involvement does not necessarily brings human wellbeing benefits (PSM analysis). On the other hand plantation workers are either worse off or have similar level of objective human wellbeing with control groups in their respective sites (in terms of mean scores), but involvement sometimes brings human wellbeing benefits (PSM analysis). However, workers tend to benefit from access to plantation infrastructure, which has a positive effect to their multi-dimensional poverty. In most cases the objective wellbeing measures do not correlate well with self-reported levels of subjective wellbeing. It is important to combine such indicators when evaluating the human wellbeing outcomes of agricultural investments in order to obtain a more comprehensive outlook of whether industrial crop production can become a valuable rural development strategy in SSA.

T1  - Global Value Chains and Agribusiness in Africa: Upgrading or Capturing Smallholder Production?
AN  - 2442961851
AB  - This article critically examines the concept of agrarian value chains in Africa, exploring the extent to which they reflect the expansion of agribusiness and its influence on agriculture. It traces the rise of agribusiness in the United States as a system based on extracting value through control over input marketing, processing and retailing in the post-war period. It examines the close relationship between US imperialism and the expansion of agribusiness and the facilitation of agribusiness interests by the rise of neoliberalism and the opening of global markets. Against the backdrop of monopolies, mergers and takeovers, it questions the extent to which conceptions of upgrading through smallholder integration into agribusiness chains accurately reflects the fortunes of smallholder farmers. It argues that far from constituting a dynamic system of entrepreneurship that facilitates acquisition of new skills by farmers, upgrading of production, and higher incomes, agribusiness constitutes a system of value capture in which transnational corporations extend their control over production and marketing through takeovers and contractual arrangements that control farmers’ production. This is largely absent from value chain frameworks, since they focus on the transformations of commodities rather than the existing relations of production, make assumptions about the relationship between upgrading and integration into global markets, and assume that failures to upgrade result from the peculiarities of national and regional settings rather than agribusiness practice. Three case studies are presented focusing on monopolies within the seed breeding, cocoa and pineapple and their impact on smallholders and national patterns of accumulation.

T1  - Contracting Sugarcane Farming in Global Agricultural Value Chains in Eastern Africa: Debates, Dynamics, and Struggles
AN  - 2442960793
AB  - Integrating smallholders within global agricultural value chains through contract farming has regained momentum in the development agenda, particularly in Africa. Governments, corporate agri-business, and global development institutions have embraced sugarcane as a suitable commodity to promote the integration of smallholders within commercial agricultural circuits so as to improve the prospects of rural development and reduce rural poverty. Influenced by the new institutional economics paradigm, win-win scenarios in which agribusiness companies and smallholders reciprocally benefit—the former by getting regular and standardized quantities of produce; the latter through secure access to the market—are advocated. However, little evidence of success in contract farming has been provided. By exploring the socio-ecological implications of contract farming within two major agro-industrial complexes (in Uganda and Tanzania), we demonstrate that the incorporation of smallholders in these schemes is spearheading dispossession from below, selection of most competitive producers, ecological degradation, social differentiation, and conflict.

T1  - The Export Value Chain of Baby Corn in India: Governance, Inclusion and Upgrading
AN  - 2442960750
AB  - It is important to understand the implications of participation in global value chains (GVCs) in horticulture for farmer and worker upgrading/downgrading. This article examines the functioning and dynamics of supermarket driven GVCs in a high-value export crop, baby corn, to understand the significance of standards in farms and pack houses in India. It explores patterns of governance, smallholder inclusion, economic and social upgrading, or lack of it, and its determinants and changing nature of farmer and labor linkages. This article presents case studies of farmers and various types of labor on farms and in pack houses, based on interviews with the exporter and facilitator management staff, field visits to the operations and a personal interview survey of 76 farmers and workers across the entire value chain of baby corn in western India conducted during 2011–2012.

T1  - Analysis of Production Efficiency, Productivity Variances and Resource Allocation among Small-holder Soybean Producers Farmers: Evidence from Benishangul-Gumuz Region, Western Ethiopia
AN  - 2302404419
AB  - This study aimed at estimating the technical, allocative, and economic efficiencies among smallholder soybean producers and identifying factors affecting production efficiency of the crop. The study used crosssectional data collected from a sample of 266 soybean producer farmers. Multi-stage random sampling technique was employed to select sample respondents. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze socioeconomic characteristics while the Stochastic Frontier Production Function was used, in order to estimate the level of technical, allocative and economic efficiencies among small-holder farmers. The results revealed that the mean technical efficiency of soybean producer farmers was 72.81 percent while the average efficiency of allocative and economic were 55.13 percent and 40.08 percent, respectively. On the sources of inefficiency, the study found that educational level, farming experience, distance to cooperative and input center significantly reduce the technical inefficiencies among soybean farmers, whereas distance to main road, access to credit, frequency of extension contacts, farming experience and ownerships to tropical livestock unit decreases allocative inefficiency of soybean among producers. On the other hand, educational level, frequency of extension contact, experience in farming, distance to cooperative and input center significantly reduce economic inefficiencies among soybean producer farmers in study area. The result emphasized the need for building rural infrastructure, adult education and training of farmers in FTC and demonstrate new technologies, need support of credit services and increasing frequency of extension and improvements in livestock in the study area.

T1  - Supply Chain Analysis of Contract Farming
AN  - 2287459748
AB  - Contract farming is a growing practice in developing countries and first-world economies alike. It generates necessary guarantees to sustain the continued operations of vulnerable farmers while enabling the manufacturers to manage the aggregate supply and price risk. We consider a single manufacturer who owns several manufacturing plants, each with a random demand for the crop. The manufacturer selects a set of farmers to offer a menu of contracts, which is exogenously specified or endogenously determined. Each "selected" farmer chooses a contract from this menu in advance of the growing season. After the growing season, under known demands and supplies, the manufacturer minimizes the distribution costs from the selected farmers to the production facilities. We formulate this problem as a Stackelberg game with asymmetric information, where the manufacturer is the leader and the farmers are the followers. The manufacturer's problem is a two-stage stochastic planning program for which we develop two solution approaches. We have applied our model to problem instances anchored on data from a large manufacturer of potato chips contracting with thousands of small farmers in India. We report on the performance of the solution methods compared with a lower bound based on the Lagrangean dual of the problem and show that the optimality gap is below 1%, for problem instances with 1,000 potential farmers. We also show how our model can be used to gain various managerial insights. As an example, when constructing the contract menu endogenously, often a small number of contract options suffices, depending on the degree of heterogeneity among the farmer pool. Thus, relatively simple menus often suffice.

T1  - Support for smallholder farmers through Islamic instruments: The case of Bangladesh and lessons for Nigeria
AN  - 2233831648
AB  - PurposeIn societies with strong presence of Islam, Islamic instruments with more scope for fairness and equity can be innovatively harnessed to play an increasing role in the development process and poverty alleviation schemes. Poor smallholder farmers dominate agricultural production in many developing countries and contribute a significant portion of global food production. This paper aims to develop a scheme to improve poor smallholder farmers’ vulnerable financial situation through the application of Zakah and Salam contract, using Bangladesh as a case study. Secondary goals are to show the effect of the scheme on food security and relevance to Nigeria.Design/methodology/approachThe authors explore the existing traditional modes of financing available to poor smallholders, identify their challenges and propose an appropriate Islamic financing scheme.FindingsWith the Zakah-based Salam forward contract, the proposed scheme would procure food through Institutional Demand to offer interest free financing, fair price and access to new marketing channels and reduce income uncertainty for the rural smallholders. The discussions indicate that the local food security will be enhanced through incentivized farming activities and disbursement of food from the food bank to the Zakah-eligible food insecure local people.Research limitations/implicationsThis proposal brings forth a potentially powerful idea that needs further empirical validation.Originality/valueThe religion-based Institutional Demand initiative to promote smallholder agricultural development and social protection is a novel one. The attempt to apply the framework to Nigeria context shows the potential of the framework to generalize for other Muslim developing countries with similar characteristics, especially the poorer agriculture-based countries.

T1  - Institutional analysis of rules governing trade in African Leafy Vegetables and implications for smallholder inclusion: Case of schools and restaurants in rural Kenya
AN  - 2216272942
AB  - The main objective of this paper is to assess rules that smallholders face in accessing market information and participating in ALV value chains, and then explore how such rules may constrain smallholder inclusion and/or foster opportunities. This paper makes two novel contributions: First, we draw on the IAD framework to analyse rules; this allows us to conduct systematic rule-based analysis while building on existing literature on institutional analysis. Second, we explore local schools and restaurants as high-value market opportunities for African leafy vegetables, which previous studies largely neglected. In the next section, we review school and restaurant value chains. We then elaborate on the concept of institutions and how it has been adapted and applied in this study. The subsequent section presents the data and methods, followed by results and discussion. Finally, we draw conclusions and offer recommendations for emerging policy around ALV value chains in Kenyan schools and restaurants.

T1  - Human wellbeing outcomes of involvement in industrial crop production: Evidence from sugarcane, oil palm and jatropha sites in Ghana
AN  - 2215402173
AB  - An extensive body of theoretical work has advocated the use of multiple human wellbeing indicators to assess the outcomes of agricultural investments in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). However, few studies have actually achieved it. This study investigates the human wellbeing outcomes of involvement in industrial crop production in Ghana by comparing the levels of different objective and subjective wellbeing measures for groups involved in industrial crop production as plantation workers and smallholders, and groups not involved (i.e. control groups). We use household income, adult consumption and the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) as indicators of objective wellbeing. We measure subjective wellbeing through self-reported levels of satisfaction with life, worthwhileness, happiness and anxiousness. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) analysis is used to assess whether involvement in industrial crop production increases household income and consumption. Overall, for most indicators of objective wellbeing industrial crop outgrowers, smallholders and independent smallholders are better off compared to other groups in their respective sites (in terms of mean scores), but involvement does not necessarily brings human wellbeing benefits (PSM analysis). On the other hand plantation workers are either worse off or have similar level of objective human wellbeing with control groups in their respective sites (in terms of mean scores), but involvement sometimes brings human wellbeing benefits (PSM analysis). However, workers tend to benefit from access to plantation infrastructure, which has a positive effect to their multi-dimensional poverty. In most cases the objective wellbeing measures do not correlate well with self-reported levels of subjective wellbeing. It is important to combine such indicators when evaluating the human wellbeing outcomes of agricultural investments in order to obtain a more comprehensive outlook of whether industrial crop production can become a valuable rural development strategy in SSA.

T1  - The Effect of Value Chain Interventions for Staple Crops: Evidence from Small-Scale Farmers in Nicaragua
AN  - 2164083074
AB  - This paper quantitatively assesses the effect of value chain development projects on market linkages of small-scale farmers of a staple crop and agricultural income. We focus on Nicaraguan bean producers participating in a value chain development project. Using a panel data set, we apply difference-in-differences and instrumental variables estimators to identify causal effects of programme participation. We first quantify the positive direct effect of training on bean sales in terms of quantity and percentage of beans sold in linked markets. Second, we show that intensified commercialisation contributes to total agricultural income, suggesting a positive indirect effect of the intervention. Our results indicate that market linkage of smallholder farmers requires different sets of intervention tools than farm technical assistance.

T1  - Gendered Incidence and Impacts of Tenure Insecurity on Agricultural Performance in Malawi’s Customary Tenure System
AN  - 2164082991
AB  - Malawi’s recent passage of Land Acts provide an opportunity to clarify different aspects of the country’s land tenure in an integrated way. To assess whether doing so might be economically justified, we explore incidence and impact of tenure insecurity among smallholders. Insecurity is not only widespread, with 22 per cent of land users being concerned about losing their land, but is also associated with a productivity loss of 9 per cent for female operators, equivalent to US$ 11 million per year at the national level, enough to pay for a nation-wide tenureregularisation programme in two to three years.

T1  - Supply chain risk potential of smallholder Robusta coffee farmers in Argopuro mountain area
AN  - 2557639777
AB  - The supply of coffee can be varied depending on several factors such as low productivity, low quality and behind the control of producers (weather, disease). Due to inelastic demand and supply, any change in supply can cause fluctuation in market price. However, coffee farmers face several problems including the various risk involved in the coffee supply chain. The aim of this research was to identify various risks involved in the coffee supply chain and to analyze and evaluate the supply chain actors’ members with the highest risk in the coffee supply chain management. The study was conducted in small enterprise of robust coffee in Argopuro mountain area Jember District, East Java. Analytical Network Process (ANP) and Weighted Failure Mode Effect Analysis (WFMEA) method was used to determine and analyze the highest risk in the coffee supply chain. The results showed that there were six risks identified in the supply chain, such as the quality of Robusta coffee production, prices, supply, environment and transport. The priority of the members of the value chain in the coffee supply chain risk management were the farmer (0.296) with the greatest priority was quality risk (WRNP 222.45).

T1  - Nutrition‐Based Incentives in Dairy Contract Farming in Northern Senegal
AN  - 2511815154
AB  - In developing countries contract farming faces numerous challenges that many times lead to its failure. Innovations that help overcome the difficulties of contracting with a large pool of small farmers in such settings can enhance the viability of such schemes. We use a randomized control trial design combined with high frequency data to investigate the impact of adding a nutrition‐based incentive in contracts between a Senegalese dairy processing factory and its semi‐nomadic milk suppliers. The incentive rewarded suppliers for consistent milk deliveries with daily delivery of a micro‐nutrient fortified yogurt for each young child in corresponding households. Findings show large and significant impacts on the frequency and amount of milk delivered, albeit limited to the dry season. We also find larger impacts on milk deliveries when contracts are managed by women.

T1  - Institutional arrangements of outgrower sugarcane production in Southern Africa
AN  - 2224249303
AB  - Management models are needed that empower local communities to produce biofuel feedstock in a manner that drives rural development. Much can be learnt through the accumulated experiences of sugarcane outgrower schemes in southern Africa. Early schemes provided limited empowerment, but protected outgrowers from the risks of volatile sugar value chains. In later schemes, processing plants were responsible for all operations and simply paid dividends to participating farmers. More recent schemes offer full ownership, which comes with greater rewards and empowerment, but also exposure to risks. The underlying institutional structures of outgrower schemes largely dictate their performance, and thus the factors that affect their viability or collapse. To understand the different institutional arrangements of sugarcane outgrower schemes we undertake a comparative analysis of 13 schemes in southern Africa employing a political economy framework that uses the three key questions: 'who owns what', 'who does what', and 'who gets what'.

T1  - Understanding gender roles and practices in the household and on the farm: Implications for banana disease management innovation processes in Burundi
AN  - 2194046014
AB  - Banana and plantain are one of the most important staple food crops and a significant source of income to smallholder farmers in the East African Great Lakes Region. Banana Xanthomonas Wilt (BXW) is a devastating bacterial disease that threatens smallholder production and livelihoods. We use a systems approach to describe how gender shapes roles and practices in the household, on the farm and in innovation processes. We draw on a case study in Burundi, where single disease stem removal (SDSR) has been introduced as a labour-saving package to reduce BXW incidence. Banana is grown by an estimated 90% of farmers, and BXW poses a critical threat to food security. We use qualitative data that include focus group discussions, interviews and transcripts from farmer learning group (FLG) discussions to describe gender norms, roles and practices and implications for awareness and uptake of SDSR in households. We identify gender patterns in innovation process, namely that men gain higher levels of access to information in FLGs than women and men are also primarily responsible for implementing SDSR. These patterns reflect gender-differentiated norms, roles and practices that are common in the household and in banana-based farming systems, thus demonstrating the ways that innovation processes perpetuate and reinforce common gender roles and practices. Women’s participation in FLGs, albeit lower than men, increases the potential of women to implement specific practices of the SDSR package. Systems approaches may be similarly used in different contexts where awareness and uptake of banana disease management packages, and other technical innovations, are not well understood. We found that gender norms, roles and practices significantly influence uptake of SDSR practices and warrant further investigation across the region, where smallholder uptake remains a pressing challenge to establish household food security.

T1  - Risk factors associated with Salmonella spp. prevalence along smallholder pig value chains in Vietnam
AN  - 2178562076
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of, and risk factors for, Salmonella contamination along the smallholder pig value chain in northern Vietnam. Repeat cross-sectional (for farm and pork shops) and longitudinal (for slaughterhouses) studies were carried out in Hung Yen and Nghe An provinces in four sampling periods over a year (April 2014 to February 2015). In total, 72 pig farms and 217 pork shops were visited during the period, and 13 slaughterhouses were visited four times. Information on management and hygiene practices was collected using checklists and questionnaires, and risk factor analyses at the farm, slaughterhouse, and pork shop levels were performed using generalized mixed-effects models with the significant levels 10%. Salmonella prevalence was 36.1%, 38.9%, and 44.7% on pig pen floors, pig carcasses in slaughterhouses, and cut pork in pork shops, respectively. The risk factor for Salmonella prevalence on pig pen floors were having a pig pen next to a household (p = 0.06) and free access to the farm by visitors (p = 0.06). Our slaughterhouse model found a single risk factor for carcass contamination: slaughter area close to lairage without hygienic measures (p = 0.03). For pork shops, presence of flies or insects on pork at shop (p = 0.02) and use of a cloth at pork shop (p = 0.02) were risk factors. The Salmonella prevalence on pig carcass and cut pork was significantly lower in winter compared to that in other seasons. Our study results highlighted the need of improving farm hygiene at farm level, and pork hygiene practices to avoid cross-contamination at the slaughterhouse and market levels, to reduce the risk of salmonellosis through pork consumption in northern Vietnam.

T1  - The long land grab: market-assisted enclosure on the China-Lao rubber frontier
AN  - 2571459989
AB  - The rise in transnational land deals has brought nationally inflected concerns about foreign land acquisition into uneasy tension with longstanding scholarly and popular concerns about dispossession. Using the case of Chinese rubber plantation promotion projects in northern Laos, we examine the intersection of these two processes during the boom decade of the 2000s, as well as the aftermath during the 2010s, when global rubber prices have fallen. We describe a ‘long’ land grab from upland communities in northern Laos that cannot be blamed on either ‘the Chinese’ (whether private, state or both) or Lao government policy, which has long mobilized political and legal authority to enclose smallholder lands for national development. Rather, what is significant is the interaction of regulatory politics and market dynamics under conditions of both unequal international relations and internally competing policy agendas on both sides of the border. Examining a case where the initial regulatory impulse from the host government was for the protection of smallholder land tenure, the paper demonstrates the need to examine the interaction of local land governance and international relations in a way that treats the latter as the product of internal struggles rather than coherent national strategy.

T1  - Bridging the gender gap in agricultural development through gender responsive extension and rural advisory services delivery in Ghana
AN  - 2415457450; 2019-00960-006
AB  - Despite the critical role women play in agricultural development their access to extension and rural advisory services delivery is limited. To improve this situation, an in-depth understanding of the importance of gender-responsive extension delivery is required. A case study of the Agricultural Development and Value Chain Enhancement Program that put in extra efforts to reach more female farmers with extension delivery and other rural advisory services was conducted. The study investigates how gender dynamics interact with the agricultural extension delivery with particular reference to the adoption of improved technologies. A total sample of 592 smallholder farmers were interviewed in selected communities in Northern Ghana. In addition to one-on-one interviews, 18 focus group discussions were also conducted in the surveyed districts. Study findings confirmed that male farmers had more access to agricultural extension delivery than their female counterparts because of their relatively better financial standing, large farm sizes, mobility to access extension and rural advisory service providers outside their communities. The study identified gendered associations with some crop types across all the study districts. However, the gendered extension delivery led to a new sociocultural order that seems to break down the gendered associations with the adoption of improved technologies.

T1  - Group membership and certification effects on incomes of coffee farmers in Uganda
AN  - 2306530721
AB  - Discrepancies in certification effects on smallholder incomes have been found in scientific literature. Unobserved farmer-group heterogeneity is a likely reason. For the long-standing Robusta coffee farmer-groups in Uganda, we find no significant effect of certification on net-farm income. But, we find 20 percentage point differences in net-farm income between certified and non-certified farmers explained by membership duration. In contrast, the recently founded certified Arabica coffee farmer-groups have positive net-farm income effects of 151 per cent, partly explained by a higher degree of vertical integration. With or without certification, long-standing group membership is found to have positive income effects.

T1  - Opportunistic Behaviour and Trust: Experimental Results from Broccoli Farmers in Ecuador
AN  - 2168116267
AB  - Linking smallholder farmers to high‐value markets through contract farming has become an important strategy to increase farm incomes in developing countries. However, various forms of opportunistic behaviour have been reported, threatening the sustainability of inclusive supply chains. When formal institutions are weak, informal codes of conduct like trust can be important complements to facilitate market transactions. We explore the effect of opportunistic behaviour on farmers’ trust, using a field‐framed trust experiment with prior signaling with small‐scale farmers in Ecuador. These farmers are linked to different types of markets, including high‐value export chains, and have been exposed to varying levels of opportunistic behaviour in the past. Our unique dataset allows us to control for self‐selection of game participants. We find that a positive signal triggers a positive response increasing trust, while a negative signal has no effect – possibly reflecting very low overall trust levels. In settings where market linkages have failed previously, ex‐ante credible positive signals could help to build trust and encourage small farmers’ participation in sustainable value chains.

T1  - GENDER INFLUENCE ON PARTICIPATION IN CASSAVA VALUE CHAINS IN SMALLHOLDER FARMING SECTORS: EVIDENCE FROM KIGOMA REGION, TANZANIA
AN  - 2166037490
AB  - SUMMARYWhen the agricultural value chain involves profit making, it results in changes in the production and distribution relationships among men and women in terms of access to and control of markets, resources and benefits emanating from product value chain participation. This affects not only individual incomes but also gender equality. This study examined gender relationships in the cassava value chain in the Kigoma region of Tanzania. The aim was to assess gender participation in the cassava value chain. Multi-stage sampling was used to select the respondents in four districts. A structured questionnaire was administered to 384 randomly selected household heads. A chi-square test was used to test for significant relationships among the variables. Results indicated that gender was significantly related to socio-economic characteristics. About 34% of the women participating in the cassava value chain were young, some below 17 years of age. There were significant relationships between gender and access to resources (land, extension services and markets), control over resources (land, house and household assets) and benefits (revenue) generated from cassava value chains. Overall, there was gender disparity in participation along the cassava value chain. These results suggest that any intervention in the cassava value chain should consider gender relations to benefit men and women and alleviate household poverty.

T1  - Bridging the gender gap in agricultural development through gender responsive extension and rural advisory services delivery in Ghana
AN  - 2163029465
AB  - Despite the critical role women play in agricultural development their access to extension and rural advisory services delivery is limited. To improve this situation, an in-depth understanding of the importance of gender-responsive extension delivery is required. A case study of the Agricultural Development and Value Chain Enhancement Program that put in extra efforts to reach more female farmers with extension delivery and other rural advisory services was conducted. The study investigates how gender dynamics interact with the agricultural extension delivery with particular reference to the adoption of improved technologies. A total sample of 592 smallholder farmers were interviewed in selected communities in Northern Ghana. In addition to one-on-one interviews, 18 focus group discussions were also conducted in the surveyed districts. Study findings confirmed that male farmers had more access to agricultural extension delivery than their female counterparts because of their relatively better financial standing, large farm sizes, mobility to access extension and rural advisory service providers outside their communities. The study identified gendered associations with some crop types across all the study districts. However, the gendered extension delivery led to a new sociocultural order that seems to break down the gendered associations with the adoption of improved technologies.

T1  - What Awaits Myanmar’s Uplands Farmers? Lessons Learned from Mainland Southeast Asia
AN  - 2582806193
AB  - Mainland Southeast Asia (MSA) has seen sweeping upland land use changes in the past decades, with transition from primarily subsistence shifting cultivation to annual commodity cropping. This transition holds implications for local upland communities and ecosystems. Due to its particular political regime, Myanmar is at the tail of this development. However, with Myanmar’s official strategy of agricultural commercialization and intensification, recent liberalization of the national economy, and influx of multinational agricultural companies, the effects on upland land transitions could come fast. We analyze the current state of upland land use in Myanmar in a socio-economic and political context, identify the dynamics in three indicator commodity crops (maize, cassava, and rubber), and discuss the state driven economic, tenurial and policy reforms that have occurred in upland areas of mainland Southeast Asian countries in past decades. We draw on these insights to contextualize our study and hypothesize about possible transition pathways for Myanmar. The transition to annual commodity cropping is generally driven by a range of socio-economic and technical factors. We find that land use dynamics for the three indicator crops are associated with market demand and thus the opening of national Southeast-Asian economies, research and development of locally suitable high yielding varieties (HYVs), and subsidies for the promotion of seeds and inputs. In contrast, promotion of HYVs in marginal areas and without adequate agricultural extension services may results in agricultural contraction and yield dis-intensification. The environmental impacts of the transition depend on the transition pathway, e.g., through large-scale plantation projects or smallholder initiatives. The agricultural development in upland MSA follows a clear diffusion pattern with transition occurring first in Thailand, spreading to Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. While these countries point to prospects for Myanmar, we hypothesize that changes will come slow due to Myanmar’s sparse rural infrastructure, with uncertainty about tenure, in particular in areas still troubled by armed conflicts, and unwillingness of international investors to approach Myanmar given the recent setbacks to the democratization process.

T1  - The Slow Displacement of Smallholder Farming Families: Land, Hunger, and Labor Migration in Nicaragua and Guatemala
AN  - 2582803363
AB  - Smallholders worldwide continue to experience processes of displacement from their lands under neoliberal political-economic governance. This displacement is often experienced as “slow”, driven by decades of agricultural policies and land governance regimes that favor input-intensive agricultural and natural resource extraction and export projects at the expense of traditional agrarian practices, markets, and producers. Smallholders struggle to remain viable in the face of these forces, yet they often experience hunger. To persist on the land, often on small parcels, families supplement and finance farm production with family members engaging in labor migration, a form of displacement. Outcomes, however, are uneven and reflect differences in migration processes as well as national and local political economic processes around land. To demonstrate “slow displacement”, we assess the prolonged confluence of land access, hunger, and labor migration that undermine smallholder viability in two separate research sites in Nicaragua and Guatemala. We draw on evidence from in-depth interviews and focus groups carried out from 2013 to 2015, together with a survey of 317 households, to demonstrate how smallholders use international labor migration to address persistent hunger, with the two cases illuminating the centrality of underlying land distribution questions in labor migration from rural spaces of Central America. We argue that smallholder farming family migration has a dual nature: migration is at once evidence of displacement, as well as a strategy for families to prolong remaining on the land in order to produce food.

T1  - Does Land Tenure Systems Affect Sustainable Agricultural Development?
AN  - 2562162993
AB  - The current study aims to investigate the agricultural investment differences among three kinds of land lease agreements and their effect on farmers’ decisions regarding sustainable growth in terms of soil conservation and wheat productivity, using cross-sectional data from rural households in Punjab, Pakistan. The “multivariate Tobit model” was used for the empirical analysis because it considers the possible substitution of investment choices and the tenancy status’ endogeneity. Compared to agricultural lands on lease contracts, landowners involved in agribusiness are more likely to invest in measures to improve soil and increase productivity. Moreover, the present study has also identified that the yield per hectare is much higher for landowners than sharecroppers, and thus, the Marshall’s assumption of low efficiency of tenants under sharecroppers is supported.

T1  - Smallholders’ Preferences for Different Contract Farming Models: Empirical Evidence from Sustainable Certified Coffee Production in Vietnam
AN  - 2562160607
AB  - Contract farming is considered as institutional arrangements that manage the coordination of production and distribution between smallholder farmers and agro-industrial firms. Under the market reforms and industrialization process, contract farming links smallholder farmers to a better market through effective farming management and high-quality products. Despite the many benefits attributed to participation, the existing literature addresses the main issues that result in the opposing attitudes and motivations toward contract farming. This study therefore aims to analyze factors that influence the choices of smallholder farmers for different contract faming models using multinomial logistic (MNL) regression. Different contract attributes and socio-economic characteristics of farmer households are used as endogenous variables in the MNL model. Based on a research sample of 183 smallholder farmers involved in certified coffee production in Dak Lak province, Vietnam, the study revealed that there are different typologies of production contract including the informal model, intermediary model, and nucleus estate model. Significant factors that affect smallholders’ preferences for different contract farming models are gender, farm size, the provision of inputs, price option, technical assistance, delivery schedule, and monitoring. Main issues that induce failures of contract farming are farmer’s overdependence and the monopolistic power of industrial coffee firms in the nucleus estate model, as well as the information asymmetry in the informal model. In addition, a cost-benefit analysis symbolizes the role of the cooperative in the intermediary model, which is essential for augmenting win-win outcomes for smallholder farmers and industrial coffee firms.

T1  - Connecting the Dots: Food, Nutrition Security and Policy
AN  - 2560875329
AB  - Hunger and the multiple burdens of malnutrition cause suffering and hold back economic potential. Eliminating food and nutrition insecurity is fundamental to reach all of the SDGs not to leave anyone behind by 2030. Leadership and policy for food system covering inclusiveness ensuring economic and social inclusion, sustainability, improved productivity, nutritious and healthy food are the challenges to sustainably and nutritiously feed 9.8 billion people by 2050, while inclusively lifting millions of smallholder farmers out of poverty. Looking at the value chain of food system, offers a number of potential benefits for addressing those insecurities, where each stakeholder can participate in any respective capacity. There is a vicious cycle of diseases and malnutrition linked to food safety concerning expectation, fact and gap. Panelist would share the facts and highlight of food safety, interlinked with diseases, malnutrition. The focus will be started with the framework of risk management and analysis, data availability, the key stakeholder, policy, laboratory, education, and core key issues that has not been addressed throughly. The recommendation and solution would be shared to the developing countries including Indonesia.

T1  - Social Capital and Adoption of Alternative Conservation Agricultural Practices in South-Western Nigeria
AN  - 2548839729
AB  - The major concern of most African countries, including Nigeria, in recent times is how to increase food production because of food insecurity issues, which by extension, is a major contributing factor to the prevalence of poverty. Therefore, adoption of conservation agricultural practices is regarded as a pathway to drive the achievement of food and nutrition security, as well as the needed optimal performance in the agri-food sector. Reportedly, scaling up of the limited adoption of these practices could be facilitated through kinship ties, peer influence, and social networks that govern mutual interactions among individuals; therefore, this motivated the study. Using cross-sectional data obtained from 350 sample units selected from South-Western Nigeria through a multistage sampling technique, this study applied descriptive statistical tools and cross-tabulation techniques to profile the sampled subjects while count outcome models were used to investigate the factors driving counts of conservative agriculture (CA) adoption. Similarly, a marginal treatment effects (MTEs) model (parametric approach) using local IV estimator was applied to examine the effects of CA adoption on the outcome (log of farmers’ farm income). Additionally, appropriate measures of fit tests statistics were used to test the reliabilities of the fitted models. Findings revealed that farmers’ years of farming experience (p < 0.1), frequency of extension visits (p < 0.05), and social capital viz-a-viz density of social group memberships (p < 0.05) significantly determined the count of CA practices adopted with varying degrees by smallholder farmers. Although, social capital expressed in terms of membership of occupational group and diversity of social group members also had a positive influence on the count of CA practices adopted but not significant owing largely to the “information gaps” about agricultural technologies in the study area. However, the statistical tests of the MTEs indicated that the treatment effects differed significantly across the covariates and it also varied significantly with unobserved heterogeneity. The policy relevant treatment effect estimates also revealed that different policy scenarios could increase or decrease CA adoption, depending on which individuals it induces to attract the expected spread and exposure.

T1  - Vegetable Business and Smallholders’ Food Security: Empirical Findings from Northern Ethiopia
AN  - 2548732015
AB  - In Ethiopia, there have been increased efforts to promote market-oriented vegetable production. Given that food security is a crucial issue in Ethiopia, the question is whether market-oriented vegetable production will actually help farmers to become more food secure. Using a mixed methods approach, the present research gathered empirical evidence on the determinants of participation in the vegetable business and its food security impacts in the Raya Azebo district. The Heckman two-stage selection model was used to identify factors affecting participation in the vegetable business and its effects on several food security outcomes. A thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative data. The results show that a farmer’s participation in the vegetable business increased significantly with adequate household productive resources (e.g., land size and access to irrigation), cooperative memberships and access to extension services. On the other hand, the age of the head of household, the market distance and risk perceptions significantly decreased participation. Additionally, the results indicate participation in the vegetable business results not only in higher food availability and access but also in lower food variety and diet diversity scores. Participation has less of an impact on per capita kilocalorie consumption and child anthropometric measures of food security. The policy implication is that, while Ethiopia is going ahead with inclusive market-driven approaches to food security, alternative mechanisms must be put in place to address the negative impacts and to empower those living in the most vulnerable conditions.

T1  - Drivers of Household Decision-Making on Land-Use Transformation: An Example of Woodlot Establishment in Masindi District, Uganda
AN  - 2548469221
AB  - Land use transformation at the farm level is attributed to household decision-making, reflected by the behavior and activities of smallholder farmers. Unfortunately, household decision-making in local communities and its determinants are site-specific and hardly understood. This study uses multistage purposive selection of households as a unit for the analysis to investigate the transformation from pure agriculture to farm forest mosaics, especially through woodlot establishment. We use key informants, household surveys, and observations to obtain data on decision-making amongst 84 farm households in Nyantonzi parish, Masindi district, Uganda, as an example. Specifically, the study addresses four research questions. Firstly, what is the current status of gender-based decision-making at the household level? Secondly, is decision making within farm households individualistic or collective? Thirdly, which factors are considered to select annual, perennial and tree-crop farm management regimes? Fourthly, what determinants influence the decision-making process and the likelihood of woodlot establishment? A multilevel analysis comprising parametric statistical models and binary logistic regression is applied to assess difference in household natural, physical, human, and social capital, highlight gender roles, and obtain factors associated to selection of crops and determinants of woodlot establishment at the farm level, respectively. Results reveal that gender based decision-making is clearly disaggregated on the basis of husbands and wives and it is individualistic, mostly dominated by husbands with lower participation by wives and other family members. Households consider various factors before making any decisions, e.g., market prices for both annual and perennial crops, food consumption for annual crops, ease of management, and yields from the previous season for the tree-crop management regimes. The likelihood for woodlot establishment is positively influenced by the willingness and intention of households to establish woodlots and relative age of household head. However, knowledge of land use Policies, Laws, and Regulations (PLRs) in relation to tree planting and harvesting and access to non-farm income reduce the likelihood of woodlot establishment. Here, we recommend that current and future forest land restoration initiatives focus on reducing the gender gap and increase women’s participation in decision making, provide market information platforms on wood products, and include woodlot farmers in social organization. Current PLRs on tree tenure should be improved and clearly communicated by using the existing communication assets and social gatherings as channels of change and influence for decision-making.

T1  - Smallholder Farmer Perceptions of Postharvest Loss and Its Determinants in Fijian Tomato Value Chains
AN  - 2548391642
AB  - The Fiji Islands, like many small Pacific island nations, are thought to incur high rates of postharvest loss. Little work has been undertaken to quantify the amount of loss within Pacific horticultural value chains, or identify the key determinants. This study sought to quantify postharvest loss within Fijian smallholder tomato value chains and to examine the relative importance of current on-farm practices as possible contributors to this loss. A semi-structured survey of 115 smallholder tomato farmers in Sigatoka Valley and eastern Viti Levu was undertaken, covering socio-economic and demographic parameters, production and postharvest handling practice, and postharvest loss based on farmer recall. On-farm postharvest loss for smallholder farmer tomato value chains was between 26.1% in Sigatoka Valley and 27.6% in eastern Viti Levu. This finding was consistent with quantification of postharvest loss in Fijian tomato chains by direct determination, but is relatively high when compared to smallholder tomato value chain loss in Sub-Saharan Africa. When Fijian tomato value chains were segregated according to specific postharvest handling practice, the contributors to postharvest loss were often associated with on-farm decision-making. Those value chains that only harvested once a week, or in the early morning (before 7 am) or mid-day onwards, stored harvest product in the field for more than three hours, did not sort or grade prior to on-farm ripening, or used packing sheds that had relatively open designs, all had consistently higher levels of postharvest loss. The prevalence of specific postharvest handling practice in both locations is further reported. While this study highlights the impact of current on-farm postharvest handling practices on tomato value chain loss, what remain unclear are the underlying drivers associated with current postharvest handling behaviour and the decision-making that shapes quality and logistic control activities.

T1  - Avocado Production and Local Trade in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania: A Case of an Emerging Trade Commodity from Horticulture
AN  - 2545588899
AB  - Avocado crop in Tanzania is sparingly investigated regardless of being an important fruit commodity. This study was undertaken to explore the yield and the value chain of this crop in the country. Data were collected mainly by face-to-face interviews with 275 avocado farmers, 231 avocado traders and 16 key informants. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test and one-way analysis of variance were used for data analysis. The average crop yield ranged from 76 to 124 kg plant−1 between regions. The average price for the farmers’ produce ranged from US$ 0.30 to 0.45 kg−1 between regions. About 72% of the farmers were dissatisfied with avocado business whereas 79% of the traders were pleased with it. A number of challenges were found hindering the development of the avocado industry in Tanzania, which in turn affects the fruit yield and the value chain. Addressing these challenges at the national, regional, district and village levels is important for improving the livelihood of Tanzanian farmers growing this crop, given the fact that a good proportion of the country’s population is employed in the agricultural sector and most of the reported challenges also affect the value chain of other crops.

T1  - Durum Wheat (<i>Triticum durum</i> Desf.): Origin, Cultivation and Potential Expansion in Sub-Saharan Africa
AN  - 2545587922
AB  - Durum wheat is an important food crop in the world and an endemic species of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In the highlands of Ethiopia and the oases of the Sahara this crop has been cultivated for thousands of years. Today, smallholder farmers still grow it on marginal lands to assure production for their own consumption. However, durum wheat is no longer just a staple crop for food security but has become a major cash crop. In fact, the pasta, burghul and couscous industry currently purchase durum grain at prices 10 to 20% higher than that of bread wheat. Africa as a whole imports over €4 billion per year of durum grain to provide the raw material for its food industry. Hence, African farmers could obtain a substantial share of this large market by turning their production to this crop. Here, the achievements of the durum breeding program of Ethiopia are revised to reveal a steep acceleration in variety release and adoption over the last decade. Furthermore, the variety release for Mauritania and Senegal is described to show how modern breeding methods could be used to deliver grain yields above 3 t ha−1 in seasons of just 92 days of length and in daytime temperatures always above 32 °C. This review describes the potential of releasing durum wheat varieties adapted to all growing conditions of SSA, from the oases of the Sahara to the highlands of Ethiopia. This indicates that the new breeding technologies offer great promise for expanding the area of durum wheat production in SSA but that this achievement remains primarily dependent on the market ability to purchase these grains at a higher price to stimulate farmer adoption. The critical importance of connecting all actors along the semolina value chain is presented in the example of Oromia, Ethiopia and that success story is then used to prompt a wider discussion on the potential of durum wheat as a crop for poverty reduction in Africa.

T1  - The Alfredo Namitete Agroecology Credit System: A New Business Model That Supports Small-Scale Lending
AN  - 2535371712
AB  - A major obstruction in the development of sustainable agriculture is the weakness of the financial and banking sectors in supporting smallholder farming. While farmers need to invest in their farms, they struggle to find credit schemes adapted to their specific needs. This study explores the literature on a range of credit systems applied in different geographical and historical contexts to analyse the underlying drivers of their successes or otherwise. In light of this review, the study investigates a farmers’ association, Alfredo Namitete (AN), in Mozambique, offering a range of agroecology credit modalities. It is then assessed as to whether a new business model initiated with seed funding could be self-managed by the association itself and lead to greater autonomy. The AN pilot tested three schemes between 2015 and 2019. Based on the findings, i.e., better production, increased revenue and greater self-determination, the study combines elements for a new business model for small-scale lending. It concludes that to be effective, a credit scheme needs to meet several conditions simultaneously: believe in the genuine will to repay, abolish the lender–borrower distance, ensure a role for women in decision making, add a savings mechanism, combine individual and collective investments and, finally, reserve funds for solidarity and climate issues.

T1  - Ocimum Sanctum [<i>Tulsi</i>]—An Alternative Additional Livelihood Option for the Poor and Smallholder Farmers
AN  - 2533155687
AB  - The scope of Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) as an alternative crop and means of livelihood, particularly for the rural poor, has not been extensively explored. Tulsi is in much demand for its medicinal and aromatic properties, particularly in Ayurveda. With increased depredation of cereal crops by wildlife, increased pest incidence, and decreasing availability of water for agriculture, an attempt was made to explore alternative livelihoods through Tulsi cultivation and value chain development. Using cross-sectional survey data of beneficiary households, the study employed the ordinary least squares method to examine the relationship between total crop income and the income from Tulsi for 2016 and 2017. The findings suggest that the average household’s gross profit more than doubled within a span of two years. Total crop income of beneficiary farmers increased by 0.8 percent for every 1 percent increase in income from Tulsi. Most importantly, the intervention has shown a tremendous adoption rate. Initially, in 2013, 200 farmers cultivated Tulsi on 8.72 hectors of unirrigated and fallow land in the five beneficiary villages, but by 2017, towards the end of the intervention period, 400 farmers were cultivating the crop on 19.6 hectors of unirrigated, fallow land in 19 villages in Chamoli District. Tulsi farming and value chain development intervention not only provided marginal and smallholder farmers in these villages with a sustainable alternative additional livelihood option but also an opportunity where they were able to sustainably generate income from unirrigated, fallow land.

T1  - Vulnerability and urban farming: Coping with price volatility in Ejisu-Juaben municipality, Ghana
AN  - 2351048836
AB  - Urban farmers remain vulnerable and trapped in poverty due to urbanisation and food crop and input price volatility. However, studies on the causes and effects as well as coping strategies to the phenomena remain inconclusive amidst diminishing urban farmlands, as the focus has been on smallholders in rural areas. This paper examines the attitudes of urban farmers on the strategies adopted to cope with input and crop price fluctuations in the Ejisu-Juaben Municipality, Ghana. Data obtained from 380 respondents showed that four major factors influence the volatility of input prices: oil prices, exchange rates, cocoa producer prices and inflation. Farmers, however, had no coping strategies to these due to the limited control over them. Two key factors were noted to influence crop price fluctuation: natural and demand and supply factors. Farmers coped with food crop price fluctuations by: adding value to crops; farming in flood plains; diversifying income sources and shifting to cocoa cultivation. A shift to cocoa production and farming in flood plains was however revealed to have adverse environmental and ecological implications. The paper recommends the promotion of contractual farming to safeguard farmers against income falls; and the formulation of an environmental strategy which emphasises drought-resistant crop varieties with shorter gestation periods as well as promoting sustainable land and water management practices.

T1  - An analysis of the smallholder farmers’ cassava <i>(Manihot esculenta Crantz)</i> value chain through a gender perspective: the case of Dak Lak province, Vietnam
AN  - 2351048699
AB  - Many rural women, who are faced with the challenges of low rural incomes and gender inequality, improve their role in the farming system based on participation in the agricultural value chain thus enhancing agricultural productivity, household income and sustainable development. This study investigates the factors which affect participation in the production of cassava in Dak Lak Province and decisions in relation to the cassava value chain from a gender perspective. Data were obtained through a questionnaire-based survey of 300 household farmers, in-depth interviews with key informants, and focus group discussions. Probit and ordinary least squares regression models in a two-stage Heckman model were adopted to determine the factors affecting females’ decisions to participate in cassava cultivation, their level of participation and their participation in other stages of the cassava value chain. The survey results show that men are prominent in all stages of cassava production but there is a more equal gender dynamic in both cassava production participation decisions and decisions relating to the quantity of cassava to be supplied for commercial purposes. This article draws attention to the continuing role challenges of female smallholder farmers, but also shows how women’s empowerment is contingent on equity dynamics in the household as well as social norms in the community and wider society.

T1  - A seminar review on red pepper (Capsicum) production and marketing in Ethiopia
AN  - 2351048590
AB  - In Ethiopia, red pepper is cultivated in many parts of the country and it is an important source of income for smallholder producers. Since the larger proportion of the pepper produced is for the market, it takes a significant share of the national income from commodity export. Even though the country cultivates pepper but its share in the world was insignificant. The pepper sub-sector can be characterized as underdeveloped, unorganized, small scale, and inefficient. Furthermore, farmers output was faced constraints such as lack of improved seeds to satisfy producers demand, lack of advice and technical assistance, non-timely distribution of fertilizer, which leads to delay in sowing and harvesting, traditional way of cultivating, lack of training for experts and shortage of manuals, publications and guidelines for spice production largely hinder the red pepper production. The red pepper value chain suffers from low production, low quality, less value addition and irregularity of supply. The actors were input supplier, producer, merchant agent, processors, wholesaler, retailer, and consumer. These problems of low quality and quantity not only influence the international competitiveness of Ethiopian exporters but also the domestic market as well. The decline of red pepper production is also attributed to poor varieties, poor cultural practices, and diseases. Despite the fact that the significance of pepper in Ethiopian economy and current income-generating capacity of pepper as compared to others has not been given due attention. By 2050 the world’s population expected to be reached 9 billion and demand for food goes to 70% and 100%.

T1  - The determinants of irrigation participation and its impact on the pastoralist and agro-pastoralists income in Ethiopia: A review study
AN  - 2351043649
AB  - This review identified factors that determine the decision of a household to participate in irrigation, and its impact on the income of pastoralists and agro-pastoralists. In Ethiopia, agriculture is the basic economic sector in which the country relies for its social and economic development. In Ethiopia, the majority of population directly or indirectly engaged in agriculture where around 95% of the country’s agricultural output is produced by smallholder farmers. However, the sector has remained in its rudimentary stage, especially in dry lands of Ethiopia. The recurrent drought is the key factor, causes vulnerability to agro-pastoralists and pastoralists. To alleviate the problem, the government of Ethiopia has taken irrigation agriculture subsector as the main strategies in the overall country’s development agenda and gives high priority to irrigation development, including smallholder and large-scale commercial schemes to exploit the untapped resources. Ethiopia is considered as the water tower of Africa. However, currently, only 5% is actually irrigated, which is very low. The basic factors influencing the decision of smallholder farmers to participate in irrigation farming are demographic, socioeconomic and institutional characteristics. Hence, to make considerable improvement on the decision to adopt irrigation, actions should be taken by household heads, government of Ethiopia, national and international organizations.

T1  - Cotton production and marketing trend in Ethiopia: A review
AN  - 2351041769
AB  - Ethiopia is one of the African countries that produce and export cotton. It has a long tradition of cotton cultivation with an estimated area of 2.6 million hectares suitable for this product. Of these 65% is found in 38 high potential cotton-producing areas and the remaining 0.9 million ha or 35% is in 75 medium potential districts. Of the total land under cotton cultivation, 33% is cultivated by small holders, 45% by private farms and 22% are state-owned farms. But, Ethiopia shares only 5% of total cotton produced in Africa. This is because it recently cultivates only 3% of the total suitable land for cotton production. Ethiopia produces an average of 33,842.11 metric tonnes in the year 2000–2018. The production trend shows some declining stage since 2012. Natural and technological constraints were existed for cotton production in this country. The country also participates on the export market and earned an average of $14,336,667 especially in the last decade. Currently the country exports with an average price of $1.45. Cotton market has also some constraints like price disincentives and lack of market information. Despite its inefficiency the cotton sector still has its own vital economic role on textile industry and employment creation. It employs about 52,754 smallholder farmers. Therefore, it is recommended that the government, the producers and other relevant stakeholders should work in collaboration to solve the constraints.

T1  - Small grains “resistance”? Making sense of Zimbabwean smallholder farmers’ cropping choices and patterns within a climate change context
AN  - 2351020900
AB  - This paper aims to understand why smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe are “resisting” to adopt small grains as a strategy for adapting to the negative effects of climate change. The uptake of small grains has been very low among smallholder farmers in climate change affected districts in Zimbabwe in spite of expert advice. The paper seeks to interrogate this “refusal” by smallholder farmers to adapt through small grains. Data were collected using fifty (50) in-depth semi-structured interviews and five (5) key informant interviews in Tsholotsho, Zimbabwe to understand why smallholder farmers are not shifting to small grains production en masse in response to climate change to address food insecurity gaps. The paper finds that there are a plethora of reasons leading to the non-adoption of small grains as a climate change adaptation strategy. The explanations vary. The paper thematically provided a critical overview and analysis of the attitude of smallholder farmers on small grains cultivation. The literature systematically selected, provided a wide coverage of the small grains production value chain. The narratives of farmers through interviews reveal their lived experiences and attitudes on small grains. This paper provides a new understanding of why small grains programming has not been successful in Zimbabwe over the years. The paper recommends that the government takes practical steps to enhance the uptake of small grains production through assisting farmers by training and funding projects of such nature for resilience building.

T1  - Socio-economic factors influencing smallholder farmers’ decision to participate in agro-processing industry in Gauteng province, South Africa
AN  - 2351020831
AB  - Smallholder farmers in South Africa have not been linked successfully to sustainable agro-processing value chains. This study aimed to identify factors influencing smallholder farmers’ decision to participate in the agro-processing industry, as well as the extent of their participation in the Gauteng Province. Data was collected through a structured questionnaire that was administered face-to-face to respondents in a randomly purposive selected sample of 102 smallholder farmers. A double-hurdle model was used to analyse factors influencing the decision to participate and the level of participation in agro-processing. The results show that very few (19%) smallholder farmers participate in the agro-processing industry of the Gauteng Province. The results also revealed that factors such as educational level, land tenure, agro-processing training and information have a positive influence on the decision to participate. Distance to market and off-farm income negatively influence the decision to participate. The level of participation is influenced by socio-economic factors such as age, household size, level of education, grain and livestock producers, farm size and access to training. The study recommends that smallholder agro-processing policy instruments be adjusted to facilitate effective participation in the agro-processing industry and participation in other high market value chains. There is a need to build up local agro-processing plants as a strategy of lowering the costs of transportation and storage when farmers take their farm produce to distant manufacturers or processors.

T1  - NEW FARMING PRACTICE AND ITS SOCIO-ECONOMIC CORRELATES IN ETHIOPIA: A CONTEXT-LEVEL APPROACH
AN  - 2341695486
AB  - Updated farming practices are found to be important in improving the well-being of rural households in Ethiopia. However, the adoption of these practices is low in countries like Ethiopia. Thus, identifying the factors that influence farmers' decisions to adopt them in their geographical and social contexts is pertinent.The study was undertaken in three purposefully selected rural Kebeles of Tarmaber Woreda namely Koso-ber, Yitam-na-kosta and Yizaba-na-woyin. Farm households were categorized into poor (41.5%), medium (52.2%) and rich (6.7%) based on such indicators as land size, livestock holdings (mainly oxen for plough), the number of times that a family feeds its members per day, housing conditions, land renting and/or sharecropping arrangement, household labour force availability, loan status, membership of cooperatives and ability to send children to school. Income loss, vulnerability to crop failure and asset depletion, alcoholism and social isolation are locally believed causes of poverty and extension input adoption. The survey result from a cross-section sample of 125 farm households shows that educational status, availability of labour access to extension service, size of land holding, oxen possession, membership of cooperatives, and perceived distance of the market were found to be positive correlates of adoption of chemical fertilizers and improved seeds.The public services should reach poor households in remote area.

T1  - Pesticide Use Practices in Root, Tuber, and Banana Crops by Smallholder Farmers in Rwanda and Burundi
AN  - 2328965893
AB  - Unlike in non-commercial food crops, which command low prices in the local market, in cash crops in SSA like potato, coffee (Coffea spp.), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), beans and a number of horticultural crops, farmers frequently use pesticides to control pests and diseases [8,9].

Due to the negative effects of pesticides on human health [14,15,16], coupled with the need to introduce environmentally sustainable intervention measures, such as Integrated Pest Management (IPM), this article investigates and compares the use of pesticides among smallholder RTB farmers in Rwanda and Burundi using descriptive statistics and regression analysis.

Findings of this study can be of significant value to several stakeholders in the pesticides value chain, including policy makers, public health professionals, vector control programs, agricultural extension workers, sellers of pesticides, and smallholder farmers.

The questionnaire was designed to capture the following: the type of personal protective equipment (PPE) used by farmers to avoid contact with pesticides during application, the signs and symptoms experienced during or after handling pesticides, knowledge of pesticides (doses, labels, toxicity), frequency of application, negative effects resulting from pesticide use (see part F on page 7–10 and part I on pages 13–14 of the questionnaire in Supplementary Materials).

T1  - Post-harvest groundnut aflatoxin management among smallholder farmers in Malawi
AN  - 2324785447
AB  - Aflatoxin contamination in groundnut production negatively affects health and trade outcomes. Aflatoxin contamination can occur at any stage along the groundnut value chain. However, the stage immediately after harvest has proven to be the most critical stage in aflatoxin management. This study presents knowledge, perceptions and practices in aflatoxin management during groundnut drying and storage among smallholder farmers in Malawi. Using probability proportionate to size random sampling techniques, the study sampled 150 smallholder farmers from three districts in the Central Region of Malawi namely Lilongwe, Mchinji and Kasungu. Descriptive analysis of results indicates that 90% of farmers harvest groundnuts at the right maturity. Results also showed that 59% farmers prefer drying groundnuts inverted in circular patches while 70% store groundnuts in polyethylene sacks on racks. Further, the study found that 97% of the farmers in the sample are aware of aflatoxin contamination but only 28% were able to identify the effects of aflatoxin contamination. These findings have implications in the design of postharvest intervention strategies on management and control of aflatoxin in groundnuts.

T1  - Realizing the Circular Economy for Sanitation: Assessing Enabling Conditions and Barriers to the Commercialization of Human Excreta Derived Fertilizer in Haiti and Kenya
AN  - 2322182801
AB  - Case studies were developed on sanitation ventures which: 1. provide container-based sanitation systems emptied at least weekly (i.e. not pit latrines), 2. cover the full sanitation value chain (provide toilets, collect excreta and treat them), 3. operate in low and middle-income countries, 4. produce fertilizers from human excreta at full scale, 5. were selling the fertilizers in the local market in July 2016.

[...]both companies had built their own in-house labs (in partnership with leading research universities, such as UKZN and UC-Berkeley in Sanergy’s case) to carry out these tests.

In Sri Lanka for instance a fecal sludge composting plant runs successfully in a town of 35,000 people, recovering all waste management costs but the main contributors of this cost recovery are the tax and collection fees [5].

T1  - Inclusive productive value chains, an overview of Indonesia’s cocoa industry
AN  - 2306178296
AB  - PurposeThe inclusiveness of smallholder cocoa farmers in the international cocoa value chain is addressed in the context of institutional voids through linkages with different business models in the region of Bali, West-Sumatra and West-Sulawesi. Being the third highest producer of cocoa, local farmers have a high dependency on cocoa cultivation; however, they lack policies that foster and reward sustainable high-quality cocoa according to international standards. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approachAn explanatory multiple-case study design assessed the relevance of partnerships in contributing to sustainable local development and inclusiveness for smallholder farmers. The selected business models, business supported, NGO supported and government supported, are evaluated through improved access to finance, training, technology, subsidized inputs and markets.FindingsThe paper found that a linkage with a business-supported model, here BT COCOA, achieves the best results in terms of improved yields, quality and farmer’s welfare, indicating improved inclusiveness via successful process upgrading. Yet, future cooperation between stakeholders should improve on access to information and finance.Research limitations/implicationsThe research is a relative research, comparing three models of inclusiveness within one sector (cocoa) in predefined regions of Indonesia. Future research should test the proposed propositions in other agricultural sectors.Practical implicationsThe paper showcases the effect of support model affiliation for smallholder farmer inclusiveness and the circumvention of institutional voids. It selects the business model as best suitable to achieve smallholder inclusiveness, as well a need to prioritize institutional voids.Originality/valueThe research is assessing three models addressing inclusiveness applying value chain assessment tools to measure inclusiveness.

T1  - Economics of Contract Farming in Potato Cultivation: Micro Empirical Evidences from Hooghly District of West Bengal (India)
AN  - 2297150242
AB  - Globalization has opened up several opportunities to the small farmers through organizing commercial mode of cultivation by engaging private sector in the value chain of production. Contract farming can be considered as an appropriate measure for the viable future of the small farmers as they can access input and credit support, technical assistance, assured price, and proper marketing opportunity which otherwise may not be obtainable to them. Under the circumstances, this paper attempts to analyze the potentiality of contract farming as an alternative mode of agricultural production in Hooghly district of West Bengal. Primary survey on a small group of farmers involved in the contract farming with Frito Lays was carried out in a selected region of the Hooghly district of the state of West Bengal. Empirical evidences suggest that contract farming can be an economically viable alternative (i.e. profitable) to large farmers in the study region. However, it has not emerged in a big way to provide means of livelihood to small farmers in the region. Limited participation of small farmers in contract farming can be explained by the stringent restrictions imposed by the contracting agencies.

T1  - Electronic wallet technology and the enabling environment of smallholder farmers in Nigeria
TT  - Electronic wallet technology
AN  - 2293539333
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to critically examine the impact of a growth enhancement support scheme (GESS) on the enabling environment of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. The main aim is to investigate the impact of the GESS on access to rural farm credit and the transport cost of smallholder farmers in the agricultural transformation agenda (ATA) in Nigeria.Design/methodology/approachThis paper adopts a survey research technique, aimed at gathering information from a representative sample of the population, as it is essentially cross-sectional, describing and interpreting the current situation. A total of 1,200 were sampled across the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria.FindingsThe results from the use of a double-hurdle model indicate that the GESS has a significant impact on farmers’ access to credit, but does not significantly impact on rural farm transport cost, which subsequently influences the price of food in the country.Practical implicationsThis implies that if the Federal Government of Nigeria is to work toward an ideal agricultural transformation agenda, transport networks should be closely aligned with the GESS priorities to provide connectivity to rural areas that provide most of the country’s agricultural output.Originality/valueThis research adds to the literature on the agricultural and rural development debate in developing countries. It concludes that embracing a rural finance and transportation infrastructure should form the foundation of the ATA in Nigeria, which, in turn, would provide a conducive environment for a more widespread rural economy in sub-Saharan Africa.

T1  - Tree Seed and Seedling Supply and Distribution System in Uganda
AN  - 2293057275
AB  - In Uganda, the tree seed sector is largely centralized, limiting access by farmers to high quality seedlings due to distant supply locations. This has left suppy of most of the tree germplasm to the informal sector, characterized by road-side tree nurseries and seed dealers who have limited knowledge on seed sourcing and collection and seedling production. Through semi-structured and key informant interviews, a sample survey involving 73 smallholder tree seed collectors, processors and tree nursery operators, this study investigates the role of government, smallholder tree seed collectors, processors and suppliers, nursery operators and the private sector in Uganda’s tree seed and seedling production and supply system. The study also identifies constraints in the seed and seedlings distribution system in Uganda and suggests key policy and institutional reforms. The source of tree germplasm is found to be heavily influenced by ease of access. About 60%) of the germplasm is purchased by individual farmers for their own planting. Low quality seed, limited seed sources and overgrown seedlings remain key deficiencies in the tree seed sector. Potential business opportunities in the tree seed and seedling production and supply value chain are identified, including production and sale of high quality germplasm. These will enhance availability of tree germplasm of high quality to meet the growing need for afforestation and reforestation in Uganda.

T1  - Determinants of postharvest losses along smallholder producers maize and Sweetpotato value chains: an ordered Probit analysis
AN  - 2289612260
AB  - Postharvest loss reduction throughout commodity value chains is an important pathway to food and nutrition security in sub-Saharan Africa. However, lack of understanding of the location and share of the losses and associated factors along the postharvest value chains remains a major challenge to operationalizing postharvest loss mitigation strategies. This paper assesses the determinants of postharvest losses at each postharvest stage of maize and sweetpotato (white fleshed and orange fleshed) value chains for smallholder farmers using our cross-sectional field survey data from two districts in Uganda. An ordered probit model estimation reveals that self-reported perceptions of the level of quantitative postharvest losses at different stages of commodity value chains are influenced by socio-economic factors as well as existing postharvest handling and storage practices. Increased years of education and training received on postharvest management are related to lower perceived levels of postharvest losses at key stages of value chains. Lower perceived postharvest losses are also associated with: at transport to homestead the use of sacks and bicycles as opposed to the use of baskets or transporting by trucks; at drying the use of tarpaulins as opposed to use of plastic sheets; shelling using bare-hands as opposed to beating cobs in sack with sticks; storage in a brick and mortar store as opposed to storing in living room in the house.

T1  - Cooperative membership and coffee productivity in Rwanda’s specialty coffee sector
AN  - 2280621419
AB  - This study uses data from 1,024 coffee producing households to address two critical questions regarding the role of cooperatives in Rwanda’s coffee sector: Does cooperative membership increase adoption of best practices and coffee productivity? and do cooperatives improve farm household welfare? Using a propensity score matching technique to account for selection bias, we find that cooperatives are a critical institution for building farmer capacity, promoting adoption of improved technologies and inputs, and increasing productivity. We discuss the role that cooperatives can play in increasing farmer welfare and reestablishing the coffee sector as a pillar of growth in the country.

T1  - Placing Rwanda’s agriculture boom: trust, women empowerment and policy impact in maize agricultural cooperatives
AN  - 2280619165
AB  - Rwanda has experienced significant economic growth following the 1994 Genocide. This growth is attributed to the expansion of its agricultural sector, specifically farming intensification and the government’s focus on creating strong agriculture cooperatives. While Rwanda’s economic development has been impressive, many academics have argued that Rwanda’s growth comes at the cost of an authoritarian governmental regime, whose policies have too heavy a hand in the daily activities of smallholder farming. This study measures smallholder maize farmer loyalty to their cooperatives using the net promoter scores of five different cooperatives. Results differ from much of the recent research on smallholder farmers in Rwanda in that most cooperative members have high levels of trust in their cooperative leaders. Cooperative members who have high levels of trust in their cooperative president, board and the Government of Rwanda are more likely to recommend their cooperative to friends and family. Furthermore, women cooperative members have higher levels of trust in cooperative leadership, the Government of Rwanda and almost all agricultural input providers mentioned in the study. Findings suggest that cooperative policy, most notably the mandatory inclusion of high numbers of women in cooperative decision-making, is helping to promote strong agricultural institutions as well as sustainable economic development.

T1  - The implications of ignoring smallholder agriculture in climate-financed forestry projects: empirical evidence from two REDD+ pilot projects
AN  - 2269795907
AB  - Changes in agricultural practices can play a pivotal role in climate change mitigation by reducing the need for land use change as one of the biggest sources of GHG emissions, and by enabling carbon sequestration in farmers' fields. Expansion of smallholder and commercial agriculture is often one of the main driving forces behind deforestation and forest degradation. However, mitigation programmes such as REDD+ are geared towards conservation efforts in the forestry sector without prominently taking into account smallholder agricultural interests in project design and implementation. REDD+ projects often build on existing re- and afforestation projects without major changes in their principles, interests and assumptions. Informed by case study research and interviews with national and international experts, we illustrate with examples from Ethiopia and Indonesia how REDD+ projects are implemented, how they fail to adequately incorporate the demands of smallholder farmers and how this leads to a loss of livelihoods and diminishing interest in participating in REDD+ by local farming communities. The study shows how the conservation-based benefits and insecure funding base in REDD+ projects do not compensate for the contraction in livelihoods from agriculture. Combined with exclusive benefit-sharing mechanisms, this results in an increased pressure on forest resources, diverging from the principal objective of REDD+. We note a gap between the REDD+ narratives at international level (i.e. coupling development with a climate agenda) and the livelihood interests of farming communities on the ground. We argue that without incorporating agricultural interests and a review of financial incentives in the design of future climate finance mechanisms, objectives of both livelihood improvements and GHG emission reductions will be missed.Key policy insightsREDD+ is positioned as a promising tool to meet climate, conservation and development targets. However, these expectations are not being met in practice as the interests of smallholder farmers are poorly addressed.REDD+ policy developers and implementers need more focus on understanding the interests and dynamics of smallholder agriculturalists to enable inclusive, realistic and long-lasting projects.For REDD+ to succeed, funders need to consider how to better ensure long-term livelihood security for farming communities.

T1  - Gendered and generational tensions in increased land commercialisation: Rural livelihood diversification, changing land use, and food security in Ghana's Brong‐Ahafo region
AN  - 2248497671
AB  - Many smallholder farmers in Jaman North District, Brong‐Ahafo Region, Ghana are shifting from food crop production to increased cultivation of cashew, an export cash crop. This paper examines gendered and generational tensions in increased commercialisation of land, livelihood diversification, and household food security in the context of globalisation and environmental change. Using qualitative, participatory research with 60 middle‐generation men and women, young people and key stakeholders, the research found that community members valued the additional income stream. Young people and women, however, were apprehensive about the long‐term consequences for food security of allocating so much land to cashew plantations. Young, middle, and older generations were concerned about their weak bargaining position in negotiating fair prices with export companies and intermediaries. Greater integration into the global economy exposed rural actors to multiple risks and inequalities, such as the uneven effects of economic globalisation, rises in food prices, hunger and food insecurity, growing competition for land, youth outmigration and climate change. The shift towards cashew cultivation appears to be exacerbating gender and generational inequalities in access to land and food insecurity and leading to exploitation within the global agri‐food supply chain among already vulnerable rural communities in the global South. With stronger farmer associations and cooperatives, however, cashew farmers stand the chance of benefitting from greater integration into the global economy, through strengthened bargaining positions. Greater understanding is needed about the complex interactions between sustainable food systems, changing land use and gender and generational inequalities in rural spaces.

T1  - Policy-induced price distortions along the small ruminant value chains in Ethiopia
AN  - 2238468497
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to identify sources and quantifying distortions to agricultural incentives to produce along the small ruminant value chains in Ethiopia.Design/methodology/approachNational and district level average nominal rate of protection (NRPs) were computed for a five-year period (2010–2015). The authors developed four scenarios based on combinations of the different data generation processes employed in relation to each of the key variables.FindingsThe NRPs at farm gate and retail market for both sheep and goats are negative indicating a strong deviation of producer and retailer prices from the comparable export prices over the five-year period. Policy induced distortions were separated from market inefficiencies through use of data on access costs throughout the value chain. These access costs are positive and significant in value. It is clear that market inefficiencies are also due to government policy to a certain extent.Research limitations/implicationsThis study focuses only on sheep and goat value chains and covers only five-year period. This certainly limits the extrapolability of the results.Originality/valueThis study presents the extent to which smallholder livestock keepers are discouraged through disincentives in a unique context. This is the first study done on small ruminant value chains in the developing world.

T1  - Availability and use of mycotoxin binders in selected urban and Peri-urban areas of Kenya
AN  - 2231461906
AB  - Aflatoxins are carcinogenic, toxic and immunosuppressive substances produced by some species of the fungal genus, Aspergillus. Consumption of aflatoxins can have serious health effects. Widespread in the tropical and sub-tropical world, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is found in many staple foods and feeds; after ingestion it is metabolized to aflatoxin M1 (AFM1), which transfers to milk. One option for reducing aflatoxin concentration in cow milk is addition of mycotoxin binders to animal feeds, but little is known about this practice in the smallholder dairy systems in developing countries. We undertook a study to investigate the availability and use of mycotoxin binders in selected urban and peri-urban areas of Kenya. Data were collected using key informant interviews with government officials and one-to-one questionnaire-guided interviews with agrovet outlets (shops that sell animal health products (such as antibiotics) and crop inputs (such as fertilizers) and feed processors. Nine different mycotoxin binder types were reported. They were sold by 8% (4/49) of agrovets and 33% (3/9) of feed processors. The binders were purchased by farmers formulating their own feeds and by feed processors. Our review of regulations found that incorporating binders into animal feeds is not mandatory and there are no specific standards governing their use in Kenya. Feed processors are expected to respect the maximum allowable limit of 5 μg/kg for AFB1 in complete feeds. Gaps in the local feed supplies that may potentially lead to increased risks of aflatoxin exposure through milk are discussed. This study provides key data on the availability and local use of mycotoxin binders, which were previously lacking. However, there is a need for continued research on their effectiveness in the local smallholder context, in order to promote their appropriate use.

T1  - Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation of participation in collective actions and adoption of climate-smart farming technologies in South–West Nigeria
AN  - 2229809177
AB  - Enhancing sustainable food security requires agricultural production systems to change in the direction of higher productivity and to mitigate lower output variability in the face of climate extreme related hazards such as land degradation. Adoption of resilient food production system capable of withstanding disruptive events is therefore needed to stabilize farmers’ productivity. Consequently, participation in collective actions has been touted as an effective approach to enhance cooperation among individuals within a social system and to advance adoption of climate-smart farming techniques (conservation agriculture). This study investigated this perspective using heterogeneous treatment effects estimation to analyze the data collected from 350 smallholder farmers selected randomly from the South–West Nigeria. The average treatment effects on the treated estimate revealed that participation in collective actions had adoption-increasing effect for each unit variation in propensity score rank, although, negative selection effect was suspected. Similarly, information acquisition, access to extension service and frequency of visit by extension workers are significant features that predict adoption in the study area. However, rosenbaum sensitivity analysis test revealed that the increasing effect of participation in collective actions on conservation agriculture adoption is insensitive to unobserved bias that may double or triple the odds of exposure to treatment. Hence, the average treatment effect on the treated estimate is a pure impact of the participation in collective actions. The study concluded that farmers with high propensity to participate in collective action have high likelihood to adopt climate-resilient farming practices compared to the counterparts with a lower propensity of participation in collective action.

T1  - Building African Agribusiness through Trust and Accountability
AN  - 2225871807
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to analyze the social institutions of trust, accountability and corporate shared value in creating an enabling environment for private sector investment in African agricultural and food systems.Design/methodology/approachThis paper uses mixed methods. A value chain framework models interactions among stakeholders in the agriculture, agribusiness and food sectors. The social institutions of accountability and trust are introduced into the model, followed by a Rwanda premium coffee value chain case study.FindingsThe conceptual and case study results show that best practices can increase smallholder farmer, agricultural service provider, financial intermediary, and food processor investments in and benefits from the agriculture sector.Research limitations/implicationsFurther research is needed on the economic foundations of development cooperation based on trust, accountability and shared values, best practices and the link with desired societal outcomes, such as the sustainable development goals.Social implicationsMutual accountability processes, as they are maturing in Africa, are at the cutting edge of creating processes where multiple stakeholders, including agribusiness, can come together to make joint commitments to a shared development agenda, and where stakeholders hold themselves and others accountable for meeting these commitments.Originality/valueThis is the first paper to bring together cutting-edge advances in corporate shared values, trust and accountability in the context of African agricultural and agribusiness development.

T1  - Combine harvesting efficiency as affected by rice field size and other factors and its implication for adoption of combine contracting service
AN  - 2205467535
AB  - Small combine harvesters have become popular in SE Asia recently, but small rice fields appear to limit its field operation and hence its wide adoption by smallholders. Combine harvesting efficiency, the area of paddy field harvested per unit time, was determined for 6 seasons in Central Lao PDR for over 400 fields varying in size and toposequence position, rice varieties grown, crop establishment methods and crop conditions particularly lodging at harvest. Combine harvesting efficiency was commonly about 3 ha/day in small fields of less than 1000 m2 and increased with the increase in field size up to 5 ha/day in the size of about 2000–3000 m2, but not beyond this range. Lower efficiency was also found in wet season than dry season, and also crops established from broadcasting compared with transplanting and drill seeding, at least partly because broadcasted crops tended to lodge more often than crops established from other methods. Photoperiod sensitive, long duration varieties grown in lower field positions also tended to have lower combine efficiency. Using the data obtained in this work, net return of combine adoption to farmers was estimated for different combine charge fees and yield levels. Increasing combine harvesting efficiency by 50% with increased field size would increase the net income of combine harvesting contractors by around 50% at current charges, allowing them to reduce the combine harvesting fees they charge. This would aid the adoption of combine harvesting services.

T1  - Sustainable beef production in New England: policy and value-chain challenges and opportunities
AN  - 2185903320
AB  - We review existing challenges and possible solutions for increasing small-scale sustainable beef production in New England. Beef production policies are most effectively implemented when the impacts of regulation, facility accessibility, and seasonality are considered. Limitations surrounding scheduling availability, skill, and services offered create challenges that reduce processing facility accessibility for small-scale producers. Relationship building facilitates trust and communication between all members of the beef value chain. Voluntary certifications offer value translation and financial networks for beef producers. State inspection and slaughter/processing programs provide scale-appropriate policy solutions for sustainable beef in New England.

T1  - Fairness and Efficiency in Smallholder Farming: The Relation with Intrahousehold Decision-Making
AN  - 2117653694
AB  - Agricultural households face collective action dilemmas when making decisions about investments in their common household farm and the allocation of resources and benefits derived from it. We relate intrahousehold decisions, as measured in a lab-in-the-field experiment conducted with spouses in agricultural households in western Uganda, with actual investments and intrahousehold resource allocation. Intrahousehold decision-making that supports cooperation and equitable sharing is associated with greater investment in the intensification of cash and food crop production, and more equitable access and control over income. Freeriding behaviour by husbands is associated with the intensification of cash crop production, but not with equitable sharing.

T1  - Can smallholder avocado production reduce poverty and improve food security through internal markets? The case of Giheta, Burundi
AN  - 2153932708
AB  - The role of agriculture in rural development is widely documented in literature. Many analysts regard agriculture, specifically small-scale agriculture, as an effective instrument for poverty reduction and food security, particularly in rural communities of developing countries where large numbers of poor people are concentrated. However whether the focus of such production should be on export crops or for domestic food security remains an issue for debate. Using the avocado industry in Giheta-Burundi, this paper argues that some emerging tree crops such as avocados present enormous opportunities to income generation and food security for small-scale farmers. This paper suggests that small-scale avocado farming presents the economic, market and health potentiality to contribute to a viable and sustainable rural economy through internal markets thereby reducing levels of poverty and malnutrition in this area. From a policy perspective, the paper suggests that the avocado sector needs to be supported by both the private and public sectors, irrespective of whether the crop is consumed, traded domestically or exported. Increasing the capacity of avocado production and trade will then enable small-scale farmers and vendors to gain greater income from this sector.

T1  - Examining the interface of sustainability programmes and livelihoods in the Semendo highlands of Indonesia
AN  - 2150322860
AB  - Voluntary sustainability standards are used as both a means of securing coffee supply by large coffee firms and a development intervention to address rural poverty and environmental management in the Global South. Using a case‐study approach, we have examined the interface between a value‐chain sustainability programme and the livelihood trajectories of smallholder producers in upland Sumatra. Our research found the programme has had minimal impacts for coffee producers to date. The level of commitment required of producers appears incompatible with the particular way that coffee is currently embedded within local landscapes, livelihoods and poverty alleviation pathways. Various sustainability standards articulate a narrative of rural development underpinned by an assumption that agricultural modernisation is the preferred pathway out of poverty for rural households. As a result, there is some risk that sustainability programmes may be inadvertently attempting to encourage household investment in a particular kind of agriculture, which is intended to assist sustainability of supply, but is poorly aligned with prevailing processes of poverty alleviation. These observations are based on a detailed study of agrarian change among the Semendo people of South Sumatra province, where processes of rural development are far more complex than assumptions presented by mainstream sustainability standards.

T1  - The Fine Line between Trusting and Cheating: Exploring Relationships between Actors in Ugandan Pineapple Value Chains
AN  - 2139803106
AB  - Inclusive food value chain development is particularly challenging when numerous smallholders engage in production and trade of non-standardised food products within spatially dispersed systems. Drawing on the concept of human activity systems with an emphasis on purposefulness, we provide a situated account of the activities and relations that shape the pineapple value chain in Uganda. Based on semi-structured interviews with farmers, brokers and traders, we examined the creation and maintenance of business relationships as well as challenges faced. Findings show how trust unfolds to mediate exchange relations that structure chain organisation. Reflecting the uncertain business environment and vulnerability of actors, trustful relationships are simultaneously threatened by opportunities for short-term gain, referred to as “cheating”. Embracing the importance of trust-based relational exchanges for sustaining local economic systems can provide critical leverage for development that puts smallholder farmers and other small-scale value chain actors at the centre.Alternate abstract:Le développement d’une chaîne de valeur alimentaire inclusive est particulièrement difficile lorsque de nombreux petits exploitants s’engagent dans la production et le commerce de produits alimentaires non standardisés dans des systèmes spatialement dispersés. En nous appuyant sur le concept de système d’activité humaine avec l’accent sur son utilité, nous fournissons un compte rendu des activités et des relations qui façonnent la chaîne de valeur de l’ananas en Ouganda. Sur la base d’entretiens semi-structurés avec des agriculteurs, des courtiers et des commerçants, nous avons examiné la création et le maintien de relations d’affaires ainsi que les défis rencontrés. Les résultats montrent comment la confiance se développe pour faire l’intermédiaire dans les relations d’échange qui structurent l’organisation de la chaîne. Reflétant l’environnement commercial incertain et la vulnérabilité des acteurs, les relations de confiance sont simultanément menacées par des opportunités de gain à court terme, appelées «tricheries». Le fait d’accepter l’importance des échanges fondés sur la confiance pour l’appui aux systèmes économiques locaux peut fournir un levier essentiel pour le développement qui place au centre les petits exploitants et d’autres acteurs de la chaîne de valeur à petite échelle.

T1  - Assessing actors in rural markets of sheep and goats in the Nyando Basin of Western Kenya: a key to improving productivity from smallholder farms
AN  - 2056624118
AB  - Livestock traders are a key conduit for incentives in livestock production systems. Their actions affect producer prices, investment decisions, and their livelihoods. However, smallholder farmers in rural communities of eastern Africa often have limited understanding of the marketing process and the interactions among market actors. This study was undertaken following the introduction of improved indigenous goat and sheep breeds in Climate Smart Villages of Nyando in western Kenya. We sought to understand the marketing of sheep and goats in five key rural markets used by the smallholder farmers of Nyando, to generate information on key market actors, their functions in the value chain, and their preferences for attributes in sheep and goats. Most traders (65%) in all the markets were men. Four different types of traders operated in the markets, producers, retailers, wholesalers, and brokers, each making a profit. Preference for selling sheep or goats and the animal attributes desired by the traders differed depending on the surrounding community. Markets in Kericho County of Nyando traded more goats than sheep while those in Kisumu County of Nyando traded more sheep than goats. There were no clear policies guiding pricing of animals. Prices offered to producers depended on previous days, and the number of animals available for sale at the marketing point. The collaborative group actions of the producers in the Climate Smart Villages did not extend beyond the level of production to the marketing of their livestock. A critical change is required for the smallholder farmers to derive better incomes from improved quality of animals following adoption of improved breeding and management practices. The results illustrate the need to engage rural market actors when implementing livestock improvement programs for smallholder farmers for better farm gate prices of animals, and thus achieve the improved incomes envisioned.

T1  - Risk Preferences and Farmers' Livelihood Strategies: A Case Study from Eastern Ethiopia
AN  - 2213130742
AB  - Low‐return livelihood strategies are crucial drivers of food insecurity that may cause irreversible long‐term damage to livelihoods. Experiments and survey results were used to examine the relative importance of risk preference and socio‐economic characteristics for households' decision to engage in specific livelihood strategies in rural Ethiopia. Agricultural intensification and diversification are prevailing strategies, and farming households who participate in non‐farm activities are better off than others. Education, information access, household income and cooperative membership correlate significantly with high participation rates in non‐farm activities and on‐farm diversification. Risk preference is an especially important barrier to households' participation in these strategies. Therefore, policy interventions that help to expand farmers' asset base and reduce entry barriers to these strategies are required to improve smallholders' welfare.

T1  - Un/associated: Accounting for gender difference and farmer heterogeneity among Peruvian Sierra potato small farmers
AN  - 2166100506
AB  - Recognizing the challenges faced by small farmers, international institutions have encouraged national governments to foster the collective organization of small farmers and farmer membership through policy interventions that target rural populations, and more specifically ‘women’ and ‘marginalized farmers’. Yet, access to membership continues to elude the most disadvantaged small farmers. Based on Peru's 2012 National Agricultural Census, we conduct a comparative analysis of small Peruvian potato farmers to identify the social markers that influence membership status. We conduct cross-group (women versus men) and intra-group (among women and among men) comparisons to tease out gender difference and farmer heterogeneity and the social markers that account for exclusion. We suggest that considering women and marginalized farmers as homogeneous and residual populations obscures the social markers that differentiate small farmers homogenizing women as a group and rendering some men and masculine gendered practices analytically invisible. This study contributes to the literature on gender and the collective organization of farmers by highlighting gender difference and farmer heterogeneity and points to gender-based inequality as well as other forms of inequality that influence the membership status. Our analysis shows that men comprise a larger proportion of potato farmers, yet the membership status of women and men is nearly equal and that associated women farmers hold the highest percentage of land titles while unassociated men hold the lowest. We also find a large number of districts without the presence of associated women potato farmers indicating the existence of gender-based spatial inequality. Our analysis of household composition points to the feminization of women farmer households due to the absence of male partners and a large presence of elderly women in comparison to men farmer households. Unlike for men, the presence of a partner and/or elderly household members has no effect on women's membership status. Similarly, the presence of girls (and not boys) under six years of age has a negative effect only for women's membership. We also find that for women, it is more important to have higher levels of education than men to participate in farmer organizations. Our intra-group comparisons indicate unassociated and associated women are differentiated based on a combination of social markers including education, economic and domestic partnership, language and land ownership. Overall, our analysis shows that while gender-based inequality persists, there are other cross-cutting markers of social differentiation among women and men that influence farmer membership status.

T1  - Production system innovation to ensure raw milk safety in small holder economies: the case of dairy complex in China
AN  - 2127547461
AB  - Food safety becomes an important issue in fast developing economies when a large growing market is supplied by many small producers through a prolonged supply chain. China is facing such a serious problem with its growing dairy market seeing serious food safety scandals. In this article, we examine a new organizational structure recently promoted by Chinese government, dairy complex, and its effects on farmers’ behaviors related to safe production and the effectiveness of such behavior on the raw milk safety, using a joint production function under risk theoretical framework. Results show that farmers’ production practices such as basic production environment and hygienic condition, disease prevention, and source and use of feed all contribute to the food safety of raw milk. Complex is an important factor contributing to farmers’ adoption of such safety production practices, together with the supervision by government, production scale, contracts with processors, and price of raw milk. We, thus, found that dairy complex as an organization structure can influence the safety of raw milk indirectly through its impacts on farmers’ production behaviors. Another important finding is that unsafe milk is a result of uncertainty when less strict production practice is used by risk lover producers, and the complexes work well for such farmers by pushing them to take more conservative safety measurements. This innovative production system can be a good measure for developing economies with similar small producer problems.

T1  - Farmer incentives and value chain governance: Critical elements to sustainable growth in Rwanda's coffee sector
AN  - 2153613094
AB  - Limited producer participation and voice in the governance structures of the coffee value chain in Rwanda, a common occurrence in many agricultural export sectors in the developing world, have resulted in low farm gate prices, restricted competition and few incentives for producers to invest human and capital resources in improved coffee production. A twenty year downward spiral of low productivity and stagnant production has ensued. Survey data from 1024 coffee producing households together with key informant interviews and focus group discussions are used to examine how patterns of investment in coffee affect farmers' productivity and profitability. Findings show that artificially low farm gate cherry prices have driven down coffee production levels and at the same time have enabled a rapid expansion coffee processing capacity. A typology of producers based on capacity to invest and incentives to invest in coffee is constructed to help explain why smallholders are the most productive and largeholder farmers are the least productive when cherry prices are low. Smallholders are ‘pushed’ to produce out of necessity (poverty avoidance) while largeholders are ‘pulled’ to produce uniquely by the lure of higher profit margins, which they achieve only when higher producer prices prevail. Policy recommendations are advanced for greater inclusion of producers in the price negotiation process and for adopting a floor price formula that includes the real cost of production as established by this research.

T1  - Livelihood strategies of cacao producers in Ecuador: Effects of national policies to support cacao farmers and specialty cacao landraces
AN  - 2153609375
AB  - This study identifies the livelihood strategies pursued by small cacao farmers in the Guayas coastal region in Ecuador, where two distinct cacao varieties are grown: the fine flavor variety, Cacao Nacional (CN), and a hybrid variety (CCN-51). Enhancing CN production is regarded as an economic development strategy since CN variety beans are characterized by premium prices in international markets. This study aims to assess the trade-offs faced by small cacao producers in the production of specialty (CN) vs. commodity (CCN-51) cacao and how they affect their livelihoods. A detailed household survey sampled 188 households. Based on activity variables, four latent profiles of livelihood strategies were identified, which were related to capital asset endowment and income share variables. The results show that there was not a clear gap between cultivation of CN and CCN-51, as 60% of the sampled households simultaneously grew both varieties. The results indicate that the variable “share of land allocated to CN” does not significantly contribute to discriminating among profiles. Households with a low share of land allocated to CCN-51 showed higher income diversification strategies and vice versa. Our study also shows that the lack of appropriate incentives may threaten the future cultivation of CN since the National policy for CN rehabilitation has had little impact on the more cacao-driven profiles that have a lower asset endowment. The design, structuring and maintenance of a domestic differentiated value chain for the CN variety, together with income diversification measures and prior improvement on the asset endowment of these profiles, seems to be the pathway to improve the livelihoods of small farmers and increase the success of the current policy for fine flavor cacao rehabilitation at the national level.

T1  - When the State Brings Itself Back into GVC: The Case of the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge
AN  - 2137868001
AB  - During the last decades the role of the state in governance of Global Value Chains (GVC) for sustainability has been largely ignored. This paper contributes to the re‐centering the state in GVC analysis. We provide an analysis of the rise and fall of the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge (IPOP). IPOP is a commitment of some biggest palm oil companies towards zero‐deforestation in Indonesia, but was dissolved after serious critique from the Government of Indonesia (GoI). Our question is: why and how did the GoI decide to put an end to the IPOP? We show that the GoI orchestrated the IPOP's demise by framing it as a danger to smallholder development, as not acknowledging public standards, and as an illegal cartel. The GoI's counter‐framing re‐asserts its sovereignty over producers, rule‐making and economic organization. We argue that when a state perceives that when non‐state‐driven GVC governance threatens its sovereignty over producers, rule‐making and economic organization, it will engage in discursive power struggle with non‐state actors. More specifically, collective action of non‐state actors can particularly trigger a state to engage in discursive power struggle with non‐state actors.

T1  - Cooperatives, contract farming, and farm size: The case of tomato producers in Nepal
AN  - 2125335628
AB  - This study investigates the impact of contract farming (CF) through cooperatives in tomatoes on employment and economic performance of smallholders in a low‐income developing country. Using farm‐level data from Nepal and a nonparametric matching estimator, the study finds a negative and significant effect of CF on employment. However, CF through cooperatives has a positive and significant impact on profits, and yield. We find that small farms (≤0.51 ha) with contracts tend to gain in profits and yield per hectare. However, large farms (>0.85 ha) with contracts employ significantly less hired labor per hectare. Finally, our estimates reveal that, compared to independent producers, smallholder households in Nepal that engaged in CF with both input and output conditions received, on average, higher profits and yield. Findings underscore the importance of cooperatives and CF. [EconLit citations: C31, D23, Q12, Q13]

T1  - Measuring the effect of agricultural cooperatives on household income: Case study of a rice‐producing cooperative in China
AN  - 2125335494
AB  - Agricultural cooperatives in China, known as “Farmers’ Professional Cooperatives” (FPCs), are becoming popular and have been intensely promoted by the Chinese government to improve the economic welfare of small farmers. However, few studies on FPCs have measured the benefits to gain farmers who participate in FPCs after controlling for observable attributes of farmers. This paper investigates the treatment effect of participation in a rice‐producing cooperative in suburban China using the propensity score matching (PSM) method. Estimated results show that a significant difference is observed between participants and nonparticipants of the cooperative in terms of net income from rice production. In addition, there is significant heterogeneity of the treatment effects between large and small farmers. Therefore, we can conclude that the participation in agricultural cooperatives is more beneficial to relatively small farmers who are subject to suffer from higher transaction costs.

T1  - Impact of contract farming on yield, costs and profitability in low‐value crop: evidence from a low‐income country
AN  - 2115540687
AB  - Lentils, a low‐value and highly nutritious crop, are Nepal's largest pulse cash crop. However, the majority of the nation's smallholders produce lentils on very small plots of land. The large gap in lentil yields between Nepal and other lentil‐producing countries underscores the importance of improving yields and income of smallholders. When it comes to the financial viability of small farms, particularly in developing countries, and globalisation, contract farming (CF) may prove useful in achieving efficiency and profitability in smallholder lentil farms in Nepal. This study employs the propensity score matching approach to examine the effects of the adoption of CF on yields, profitability and costs of smallholder lentil farms in Nepal. Findings from this study reveal that contrary to popular belief, CF adoption by lentil producers in Nepal has a positive and significant effect on per‐hectare revenues, profits and yield and a negative impact on variable and transportation costs. The study finds that only very smallholder lentil farms (0.01‐0.05 ha) benefit from CF.

T1  - Production Risks, Risk Preference and Contract Farming: Impact on Food Security in India
AN  - 2306244631
AB  - This article reviews the literature on contract farming (CF) in India and assesses the impact of smallholders’ perceived production risks on the adoption of CF; the impact of CF on smallholders’ food security; and its impact on employment generation in their farming enterprises. We also show the impact of the outcome variables by risk preference of smallholders. Using farm-level data and endogenous switching regression methods, this study presents three key findings. First, the perception of weather and pest risk, access to irrigation facilities, extension visits, and access to institutional credit are the main drivers of CF adoption. Second, CF adoption increases food security and varies with the revealed risk preference of smallholders, and risk-seeking smallholders tend to gain higher food security. Third, regardless of revealed risk preferences, smallholders who did not adopt CF benefit from adoption by reducing their labor requirements, with no significant losses in yield.

T1  - In All Shapes and Colors: Varieties of Contract Farming
AN  - 2306244492
AB  - Contract farming, wherein a processor contracts out the production of an agricultural commodity to a grower, is the first step toward more vertically coordinated—and thus more modern—agricultural value chains. As such, in principle contract farming is a necessary condition for the structural transformation of developing economies to occur. Yet contract farming is far from monolithic, and the institution takes on a variety of forms. In this article, we describe how the institution of contract farming varies in cross-sectional data covering 1,200 households across six regions of Madagascar, half of which are growers in contract farming agreements covering a dozen different crops. In this setting, participation in contract farming has been associated with increases in income, improvements in food security, and reductions in income variability. Given those presumed effects in this setting of participation in contract farming, we then look at the correlates in our data of participation in contract farming. as well as one’s willingness to pay to participate in contract farming as a grower in an attempt to better target policies aimed at encouraging participation in contract farming.

T1  - Integration of small-scale handloom producers into global value chains: Insights from Kannur Handloom Cluster, India
AN  - 2194127601
AB  - This paper examines how a group of small-scale handloom producers from India remain competitive and get integrated into global value chains. Using a case study of a buyer-driven handloom value chain, this paper analyses the nature and characteristics of inter-firm relationships, governance, and upgrading practices in the selected handloom value chain. The study shows how these small-scale handloom producers engage with the handloom exporters and other chain participants, including input suppliers and business service providers, and improve their competitiveness. The results indicate the role of inter-firm relations in facilitating joint and collective actions among the chain participants that lead to collective efficiency. The study identifies two pathways of upgrading in the handloom value chain: a governance-driven and a cluster-driven pathway. The findings have implications for value chain interventions aimed at small-scale handloom and similar producers.

T1  - Is agricultural adaptation to global change in lower-income countries on track to meet the future food production challenge?
AN  - 2135608842
AB  - Agriculture is critical to sustainable development, and agricultural production by smallholders in lower-income countries contributes substantially to the food security of both rural and urban populations. Smallholders face many challenges related to urbanisation, sustainable use of natural resources and climate change. While there will be different ways of achieving sustainable agricultural systems, all will involve adaptation on a massive scale to meet the future food production challenge at greatly reduced carbon cost. Here we evaluate recent progress in agricultural adaptation using surveys in five regions, 21 countries and 45 sites, covering 315 villages and approximately 6300 households. These surveys include information about the changes made to farming systems in the last decade. We synthesise this information by grouping households into types: food insecure, hanging in, stepping up and stepping out. We then profile each site in terms of its proportion of households of these four types. While farmers have made some changes in their farming practices over the last decade, most changes have been incremental and piecemeal. We find little evidence in the study sites in any region of farming changes at the scale needed to enhance food security of significant proportions of the population. Searching for commonalities in the enabling environment among sites with similar proportions of household types, we found collective action at the community level coupled with appropriate climate information provision and the active participation of local organisations to be associated with higher levels of food security. To foster the changes needed in agricultural and food systems, a much stronger focus will be required on the enabling environment if food security goals are to be attainable. Without more nuanced and effective targeting of technological as well as institutional interventions, agricultural adaptation to meet the food production challenge in the coming decades is unlikely to occur.

T1  - Global value chains and traditional supply chains: Evidence from Guatemala
AN  - 2102339191
AB  - Global value chains have been at the centre of recent research, but traditional supply chains have been given much less attention. However, quantitative data on both chain types is scarce. Therefore, it remains unclear how much smallholders, formal and informal sectors in traditional and global value chains contribute to gross domestic product (GDP), employment generation and income distribution. This article, by using a broad primary data set of 28 value chains in Guatemala, evidences that traditional chains contribute substantially to the national economy and that the income generated is much more equally distributed than in global value chains.

T1  - Power Relations and Upgrading in the Cashew Value Chain of Côte d'Ivoire
AN  - 2099267754
AB  - Development organizations are increasingly adopting market‐based approaches to reducing rural poverty and food insecurity in the global South. The value chain approach is particularly popular. Aid donors, governments and non‐governmental organizations are applying value chain concepts originally designed for promoting industrial production to smallholder agricultural production. Cashew development in Côte d'Ivoire illustrates this new approach to rural development in which ‘upgrading’ the production and processing links are top priorities. A core assumption informing this approach is that improvements in product quality at the producer level will yield higher producer prices and incomes. This article examines this assumed quality–price relationship through a comparative analysis of cashew quality and prices in Côte d'Ivoire. The research reveals a disconnect between nut quality and producer prices. The case study demonstrates that power relations are more important than quality in setting producer prices for raw cashew nuts.

T1  - Decoupling from international food safety standards: how small-scale indigenous farmers cope with conflicting institutions to ensure market participation
AN  - 2016176248
AB  - Although inclusion in formal value chains extends the prospect of improving the livelihoods of rural small-scale producers, such a step is often contingent on compliance with internationally-promoted food safety standards. Limited research has addressed the challenges this represents for small rural producers who, grounded in culturally-embedded food safety conceptions, face difficulties in complying. We address this gap here through a multiple case study involving four public school feeding programs that source meals from local rural providers in the Bolivian Altiplan. Institutional logics theory is used to describe public food safety regulations and to compare them to food safety conceptions in the local indigenous Aymara rural setting. We identify a value-based conflict that leads to non-compliance of formal food safety rules that jeopardizes the participation of small farmers in the market. These include: (1) partial adoption of formal rules; (2) selective adoption of convenient rules; and (3) ceremonial adoption to avoid compliance. Decoupling strategies allow local actors to largely disregard the formal food safety regulations while accommodating traditional cultural practices and continuing to access the market. However, these practices put the long-term sustainability of the farmers’ participation in potentially favorable opportunities at risk.

T1  - Can group farms outperform individual family farms? Empirical insights from India
AN  - 2088083050
AB  - Is there an alternative model to small family farming that could provide sustainable livelihoods to millions of resource-constrained and often non-viable smallholders in developing countries? Could group farming constitute such an alternative, wherein smallholders voluntarily pool land, labour and capital to create larger farms that they manage collectively? In South Asia, for instance, over 85% of farmers are small and increasingly female. Potentially, group farming could provide them economies of scale, a dependable labour force, more investible funds and skills, and greater bargaining power with governments and markets. But can this potential be realised in practice? In particular, can group farms economically outperform small family farms? A rare opportunity to test this is provided by two experiments begun in the 2000s in the Indian states of Kerala and Telangana. Constituted only of women, the groups lease in land to farm collectively, sharing labour, the cost of inputs, and the returns. But the states differ in several respects, including the technical support the groups receive, and their institutional base, composition, land access and cropping patterns. Based on the author's primary sample surveys in both states, this paper compares the productivity and profitability of group farms with that of small individual family farms in the same state. Kerala’s groups perform strikingly better than the predominantly male-managed individual farms, both in their annual value of output per hectare and annual net returns per farm, while in Telangana group farms perform much worse than individual farms in annual output, but are equivalent in net returns. In both states, groups do much better in commercial crops than in traditional foodgrains, where the largely male-managed individual farms, owning good quality land and with longer farm management experience, have an advantage. The factors underlying the differential performances of Kerala and Telangana, and the lessons learnt for possible replication, are also discussed. Overall, the paper demonstrates that group farming can provide an effective alternative, subject to specified conditions and adaptation of the model to the local context.

T1  - Determinant in Intensity of Farmers’ Participation in Contract Farming
AN  - 2442852667
AB  - This article examines the intensity of farmers’ participation in contract farming by estimating the allocation of land and family labour for the contract and non-contract crops. In addition, factors that influence farmers’ decision to allocate land for the contract crop was identified. The analysis of this article is based on 159 households of Telangana state. The empirical results indicated that farmer is likely to employ proportionately more family labour for contract crop compared to non-contract ones. Small farmers proportionately allocate more land and family labour for the contract crop compared to large ones. Landholding size, education and income have influenced farmers’ decision to allocate land for growing gherkin, while it is landholding size, family size and income in case of hybrid paddy seed. To increase participation of small farmers, focus should be given to improve the education level and increase the landholding size through implementation of proper land policy.

T1  - Co-designing win-win partnerships between agroindustries and smallholders in the palm oil sector in Cameroon
TT  - Co-construire des partenariats gagnant-gagnant entre agro-industries et planteurs dans la filiere huile de palme au Cameroun
AN  - 2121511318
AB  - Description of the subject. To boost the development of the national palm oil sector, one of the most promising moves for the Cameroonian government would be to improve partnerships between agro-industries and smallholders in order to increase the latter's plantation yields and oil extraction rates. Objectives. Drawing on successful experiences in Southeast Asia, this paper examines the conditions for establishing a winwin partnership between agro-industrial companies and smallholders in the Cameroonian palm oil sector. Method. The study was carried out in three production basins in the Centre and the Southwest regions of Cameroon where such partnerships were initiated before the collapse of the National Aid Fund for Rural Development (FONADER) in the 1970s. In participatory workshops involving at least twelve stakeholders (palm oil producers, artisanal and industrial millers, intermediaries and agricultural extension services), the participants' knowledge was integrated together through individual and collective reflection, with a guarantee of equal expression and consideration of views. Two workshops followed a strict adaptation of Participatory Prospective Analysis (PPA); a third followed a semi-directed participatory approach. Interactions between participants produced definitions of the systems studied and the variables involved, different plausible future scenarios, and recommendations for decision making. Results. Access to technical and managerial capacity building, terms of the contract, access to shareholding in the company by smallholders, and legalization of the terms of the contract emerged as the major items that would influence a sustainable partnership between agro-industries and smallholders. Conclusions. Participatory derived recommendations show that long-term partnerships between agro-industry and smallholders depend on a negotiated contract agreement between the partners to ensure transparency and trust. In addition, a dedicated smallholder department in charge of village plantations within agro-industrial companies can facilitate communication between partners.Alternate abstract:Description du sujet. Afin de développer le secteur de l'huile de palme au Cameroun, une des voies les plus prometteuses pour le gouvernement consiste a améliorer les partenariats entre agro-industries et petits planteurs afin d'augmenter les rendements et les taux d'extraction en huile des plantations villageoises. Objectifs. S'inspirant de l'expérience du développement du secteur de l'huile de palme dans les pays d'Asie du Sud-Est, cet article examine les conditions de mise en œuvre de partenariats gagnant-gagnant entre les entreprises agro-industrielles et les exploitations familiales de la filiere. Méthode. L'étude a été menée dans trois bassins de production des régions du Centre et du Sud-Ouest du Cameroun oü ces partenariats avaient été initiés dans les années 1970 avant l'effondrement du Fonds National d'Aide au Développement Rural (FONADER). Lors d'ateliers participates regroupant au moins douze participants (producteurs d'huile de palme, moulins artisanaux et industriels, intermédiaires et services de vulgarisation agricole), les connaissances des participants sont intégrées, partant d'une réflexion individuelle puis collective, garantissant une expression et une considération égales des points de vue. Deux ateliers ont été organisés suivant une stricte adaptation de la méthode d'Analyse Prospective Participative (PPA) et un troisieme atelier suivant une approche participative semi-dirigée. Les interactions entre les participants se focalisent sur la délimitation du systeme étudié, les énoncés de variables, les différents scénarios plausibles, et des recommandations pour la prise de décision. Resultats. L'acces au renforcement des capacités techniques et managériales, les termes du contrat, l'acces des petits planteurs a l'actionnariat des agro-industries et la légalisation des termes du contrat ressortent comme les éléments majeurs d'un partenariat durable entre les agro-industries et les petits exploitants. Conclusions. Les recommandations élaborées de façon participative montrent qu'un partenariat de long terme entre l'agroindustrie et les petits planteurs dépend d'un accord contractuel négocié entre partenaires susceptible d'assurer la transparence et la confiance. De plus, la création au sein des agro-industries d'un département en charge des plantations villageoises faciliterait la communication entre partenaires.

T1  - Exploring Information Seeking Behavior of Farmers’ in Information Related to Climate Change Adaptation Through ICT (CHAI)
AN  - 2092569103
AB  - In Tanzania, agriculture sector is known for employing more than 70% of the total population. Agriculture sector faces many challenges including climate change. Climate change causes low productivity in agriculture; low productivity is caused due to poor implementation of agricultural policies and strategies. This poor implementation of policies has also caused many farmers to be not competent in climate change adaptation. Over the years, provisions of agricultural advice and extension were provided by various approaches, including training and visit extension, participatory approaches, and farmers' field schools. However, provision of agricultural advisory and extension service is inefficient. Also, in most cases the usage of most agricultural innovations and technologies developed is limited. A literature review indicates that the main reasons given by Tanzanian farmers for not using improved technology are not lack of knowledge or skill, but rather that the technologies do not contribute towards improvements (e.g., the technologies are not profitable or they imply to high risk). Thus, agricultural extension service needs to be geared towards teaching farmers how to develop innovative and cost effective technologies that are contextualized. Limited numbers of agricultural extension staff and less interactivity of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), such as radio and television, have been mentioned to be among the factors limiting the provision of agricultural advisory and extension services to the majority of farmers in Tanzania. The advancements in ICTs have brought new opportunities for enhancing access to agricultural advisory and extension service for climate change adaptation. In Tanzania, farmers and other actors access agricultural information from various sources such as agricultural extension workers and use of various databases from Internet Services Providers. Also there are different web - and mobile - based farmers' advisory information systems to support conventional agricultural extension service. These systems are producing bulk amounts of data which makes it difficult for different stakeholders to make an informed decision after data analysis. This calls for the need to develop a tool for data visualization in order to understand hidden patterns from massive data. In this study, a semi-automated text classification was developed to determine the frequently asked keywords from a web and mobile based farmers' advisory system called  UshauriKilimo after being in use for more than 2 years by more than 700 farmers.
Keywords: agro-advisory service, climate change adaptation, information, needs, seeking, behaviour
Background Information
Agriculture is the backbone of most African countries (Eicher, 2003; Havnevik Bryceson, Birgegård, Matondi, & Beyene, 2007; Salami, Kamara, & Brixiova, 2009; Lwoga, Ngulube, & Stilwell, 2011). In Tanzania, the sector is known for employing more than 70% of the total population, contributing about 25% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), bringing about 66% of the foreign exchange, and providing raw materials for local industries (United Republic of Tanzania [URT], 2008, Haug & Hella, 2013). The sector also feeds the nation and is the source of livelihoods to most rural communities in the country. However, agriculture is identified as one of the sector's most vulnerable to climate change (Mwandosya, Nyenzi, & Lubanga, 1998). This has led to difficulty in maintaining food security in most of the countries including Tanzania (Isinika, Hella, & Moshi, 2016; Haug, 2016). Food security is not only affected by climate change but also other factors including: lack of agricultural support services, weak research-extension-farmer linkages, among others (URT, 2008; Isinika et al., 2016). These factors hinder agricultural policies and strategies, which have been implemented over the years. Consequently, poor implementation of agricultural policies has resulted in rural and farming communities in the country failing to adapt to the impact of climate change. Ospina and Heeks (2010) argue that adaptation is the act of household, communities, regions, or nation to either tolerate, withstand, resist, or absorb the impact brought on by climate change. Examples of impacts that can be brought by the effect of climate change are food security, livelihoods, human settlement, and water supply (Ospina & Heeks, 2010).
Climate change is a threat to human societies and natural ecosystems, yet public opinion research finds that public awareness and concern vary greatly (Lee, Markowitz, Howe, Ko, & Leiserowitz, 2015; Haug, 2016). Shackleton, Ziervogel, Sallu, Gill, and Tschakert (2015) report that to enhance understanding of the process of climate change adaptation and to facilitate the planning and implementation of socially-just adaptation strategies, deeper consideration of the factors that impede adaptation is required. In response, scholars have done much research to identify barriers to adaptation of climate change (Upadhyay & Bijalwan, 2015). However, despite this progress, knowledge of barriers that hamper adaptation in developing countries remains limited, especially in relation to underlying causes of vulnerability and low adaptive capacity (Mutabazi, George, Dos Santos, & Felister, 2014; Mutabazi, Amjath-Babu, & Sieber, 2015). Adaptation goes hand-in-hand with awareness among farmers. One of the approaches used as an awareness technique to deliver climate change adaptation information is the conventional extension service (Tumbo et al., 2015).
The advancements in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have brought a new opportunity for enhancing access to agricultural advisory and extension services (Upadhyay & Bijalwan, 2015). Empirical evidence from other developing countries like India, South Africa, and Ghana has shown that ICT have enhanced access to and usage of agricultural advisory and extension service (Aker, 2011; George et al., 2011). However, ICTs differ in terms of interactivity; thus, ICT can be categorized into traditional (less interactive) and modern (more interactive). The radio, television and the telephony are traditional ICTs most used in Tanzania (Mtega, 2012). Traditional ICTs are less interactive and in most cases they rarely enhance two-way traffic in the communication process, and when a feedback is made possible, it is not synchronous. Moreover, dissemination of agricultural information to farmers through traditional ICTs is always top-down in nature. Cole and Fernando (2012) describe top-down agricultural information dissemination result in an inadequate diagnosis of the difficulties being faced by farmers as the channel used does not facilitate a feedback mechanism. Thus, conventional ICTs are not effective for the provision of agricultural advisory and extension services in some rural areas of Tanzania. Modern ICTs used in Tanzania as mentioned by Sanga, Phillipo, Mlozi, Haug, and Tumbo, (2016) includes Internet, mobile phone applications, and ICT enabled agro-advisory systems. Modern ICTs are more interactive ICTs as they allow more collaboration and provisions for instant feedback from crowd. Studies in Tanzania show that among the modern ICTs, mobile phones are the most used (Mtega & Malekani, 2009; Mtega, 2012; Sife, Kiondo, & Lyimo‐Macha, 2010; Sanga Phillipo, Mlozi, Haug, & Tumbo, 2016).
According to the Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA) second quarterly statistics report of 2016, mobile phone infrastructure and the subscriptions to mobile phone services has grown exponentially over the past 10 years (Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority [TCRA], 2016; TCRA, 2017). This has created an opportunity to use mobile phone services among most of Tanzania from both urban and rural areas. Moreover, TCRA (2016) shows that both the on and off net tariffs have been falling from the year 2005 to 2016 thus making mobile phone services more affordable to the majority in the country. The report showed that subscriptions to mobile networks reached more than 41 million subscriptions registered at the end of June 2017. In this period, more than 3.7 billion text messages (SMS) were used to communicate (TCRA, 2017). This is the evidence why system that supports communication via SMS was opted in this study.
The reporti from workshop on  Improving Climate Services for Farmers in Africa and South Asia  identified challenges that hinder farmers from using climate services in different countriesii. The identified challenges from the report are as follows: traditional climate information is not well documented, there is a lack of accessibility to climate services, there exists ignorance or lack of knowledge on the availability of climate services, an absence of climate education is apparent, climate information not user friendly, there is lack of trust from farmers towards the service providers, at times the type of information is not reliable, there are inconsistencies in the information delivery, climate information is untimely communicated to farmers, channels of communications are not of the same quality depending on who is doing the communicating, when the communication occurs, and by what medium is used; language and technical understanding of the climate forecasts makes it problematic to interpret; there is a failure to analyze the benefits of climate information; there are poor linkages among actors along the value chains (e.g., between seed suppliers and farmers); there is a lack of sufficient capacity to make use of the information; climate information (especially the science-based) is mostly generalized and difficult to localize and access, and understanding of climate information (Tall et al., 2014).
Hence, there is no doubt that there is a need to enhance farmers access to advisory and extension service related to climate change adaptation using a blend of conventional methods, mobile phone applications, and other ICTs (Caine et al., 2015).
Significance of the Research Problem
Agricultural advisory and extension services in Tanzania are ineffective partly because most of the generated knowledge and information aimed to improve agricultural production do not reach farmers (Mkapa, 2005; URT, 2008). Also, farmers in Tanzania argue that the problem is due to lack of capital and labour. Furthermore, farmers cannot afford to take the risk and that farming is not necessarily profitable) (Haug, Hella, Nchimbi-Msolla, Mwaseba, & Synnevag, 2016; Haug, 2016). In most cases usage of developed agricultural innovations and technologies is limited due to limited number of agricultural extension staff with low access to agricultural information (United Republic of Tanzania [URT] 2011). Yet, there is fast growing ICT infrastructure in Tanzania in both rural and urban areas (TCRA, 2017). Several studies have shown that rural farmers in Tanzania have started using ICTs for accessing various services to support their farming (Sanga, Kalungwizi, & Msuya, 2013; Sanga, Mlozi, Tumbo, Mussa, Muhiche, & Haug., 2014; Churi, Mlozi, Mahoo, Tumbo, & Casmir, 2013; Mtega, 2012; Nyamba & Mlozi, 2012; Churi, Mlozi, Tumbo, & Casmir, 2012; Chilimo, 2008; Mtega & Malekani, 2009; Mushi & Nduye, 2012; Alhassan & Kwakwa, 2012). Despite of a number of researches in Tanzania, there are few studies that have been done related to research in developing tools for visualizing data in climate change adaptation (Sanga, Sumari, & Tumbo, 2013). Even though there is potential of ICT for agriculture in Tanzania, enabling farmers to access agriculture information on climate change adaptation has not been addressed well (Mushi & Nduye, 2012; Isinika et al., 2016).
Limited access to timely and accurate information has been identified as a major hindrance to enable farmers to get agriculture information on climate change adaptation (Ajayi et al., 2008). The evidence of this fact is that farmers have no reliable way of knowing when to plant their crops due to change of rainfall patterns (Mwalukasa, 2013). As such, farmers plant before it rains, which leads to destruction of seeds in the soil. Under such circumstances, this deprivation on the farmers could be greatly reduced if they had prior information regarding weather conditions. The forecast of weather need to be done using sophisticated technology since the rain patterns have changed and that the small rainy season has more or less disappeared in some placed (Haug, 2016).
In the light of the above, the Government of Tanzania has taken a number of steps to come up with different ICTs tools, including radio and television, through which farmers could access agricultural knowledge and information (Lwoga, 2010; Mushi & Nduye, 2012). However, there are some drawbacks with regard to the effectiveness of these tools in disseminating and communing climate change adaptation information. First, the broadcast media, such as television and radio, are expensive and most farmers cannot afford to buy them. Second, timing of the information is another problem. To access the information, farmers have to be listening or watching at the same time the programme is broadcasting (Mntambo, 2007). Hence, farmers are adopting mobile phones to access agricultural information which are cost effective, accessible, and cheap (Sanga, Mlozi, Haug, & Tumbo, 2016). Despite the fact that mobile phones-based applications are mostly used to enhance agricultural extension service but have brought a new challenge (Wyche & Steinfield, 2016). This challenge is caused by massive data which are generated (Keim, Kohlhammer, Ellis, & Mansmann, 2010). Thus, the massive data generated call for a need of developing a tool for data visualization. The aim is at helping farmers and other actors to make informed decision out of the user generated massive data. Content analysis using word or content cloud has been studied by many researchers (McNaught & Lam, 2010; Cidell, 2010) but its applicability in analysing massive (or big data) generated in ICT based agro-advisory service systems (with content in Swahili) is not adequately researched. This is the research gap which this study seeks to fill. Thus, the goal of this paper is to evaluate information seeking behaviour/patterns of farmers who used  UshauriKilimo for more than two years in consulting for advisories related to climate change adaptation.
This study tried to answer the following research questions:
1.  What are the information needs of farmers in Tanzania who are using UshauriKilimo in advisory information related to climate change adaptation?
2.  What are the information seeking behaviors of farmers in Tanzania who are using UshauriKilimo in advisory information related to climate change adaptation?
Research Methodology
Description of the Study Sites
The study was conducted in Kilosa District. Kilosa District has good ICTs infrastructure which enable access and use of mobile phones on various uses. Also, this District has been chosen due to high agricultural produce and high arable land for cultivation. In addition, the District is experiencing effect of climate change (Paavola, 2008; Mutabazi et al., 2014; Mutabazi et al., 2015).
Research Design
The research adopted the qualitative research method. Specifically, content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data which is found on  UshauriKilimo server.
Case Study of UshauriKilimo
UshauriKilimo was developed through participatory action research method (Sanga, Phillipo, Mlozi, Haug, & Tumbo, 2016). It allows farmers and other actors to use their mobile phones to access agricultural information from researchers and extension workers (Sanga, Mlozi, Haug, & Tumbo, 2016). The agricultural information consists of different categories of information needed by farmers, including information related to adaptation of climate change. The stakeholders/actors who are using UshauriKilimo have been given capacity building for more than two years. The capacity building and empowerment activities were done through training and workshops. Also, there were visits by farmers from Dodoma Municipal in Dodoma and Kilolo District in Iringa to Kilosa farmers in Morogoro. Currently, there are more than 700 farmers who are using UshauriKilimo. The farmers who are using UshauriKilimo are producing massive data (i.e., big data) relating to different topics in agriculture including climate change.
Figure 1. Data analysis process.
UshauriKilimo is a crowdsourcing platform which allows farmers and other actors (i.e., crowd) to engage in all phases of research process (Sanga, Phillipo, Mlozi, Haug, & Tumbo, 2016). This act of engaging farmers and other actors in scientific investigation is called citizen science. Citizen science refers to the engagement of farmers and other actors (i.e., non-professional volunteers) in scientific investigations (i.e., by asking questions for needs, requirements assessment, or collecting data; developing software, evaluation of software, using the software, or interpreting results (Newman et al., 2012).
Data Analysis
After massive data had been deposited in a crowdsourcing platform, the data mining tool was developed to help farmers search information using different keywords. The tool fetched data from the UshauriKilimo knowledge server (Figure 1). The results from the search were further subjected to data cleaning. The cleaned data were extracted to the data mining tool. The aim of this process was for recognizing a pattern of most frequent words (i.e., word visualization) from the corpus of a crowdsourcing platform.
In order to harvest data for this study, data from UshauriKilimo with keywords, such as climate or weather, were searched. Since the data in UshauriKilimo was in Swahili, the keyword that was used during searching was "hali ya hewa" (Table 1). After that had been collected, the data were analysed using a mixed methods approach (i.e., manual content analysis method and automated text classification, such as semi-automatic text classification).

Results and Discussion
A simple search in a crowdsourcing platform using the keyword "hali ya hewa" (Swahili word for weather and climate), 22 questions and answers were obtained (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Search interface for the system.
Then all 22 statements containing questions and answers were cleaned to remove mobile phone numbers of farmers who asked questions and the dates when the questions were asked. After this data cleaning process, 1148 words were extracted (Figure 3).
Figure 3. Data cleaning of the results from simple search.
The 1148 words obtained were entered or superimposed in a web-based word or text visualization system or word cloud (www.wordle.net).
Limitations of Study
This study has some limitations which need to be noted. According to Zhu, Rodríguez-Hidalgo, Questier, and Torres-Alfonso (2015) the study which deals with analysis of texts has limitations in terms of the following factors, namely: sample size, contextualized environment of the study, and Hawthorne effect. With respect to these factors, the study sample size was small and limited to 22 farmers who asked advisories related to "climate change." Secondly, the result of this study is applied to a specific setting and thus, cannot be generalized. Lastly, the results might be related to the so-called Hawthorne effect as the respondents who are either farmers, extension agents, and researchers were introduced to new method of agro-advisory system using ICT. This system was used to complement a conventional agricultural extension system and was not used on its own.
Figure 4. Word cloud after analysis using Wordle.
Words which appear most in the 22 frequently asked questions were: climate, weather, agriculture, soil, water, teak, forestry, rain, drip irrigation, hot temperature, crops, passion, and advisory (Figure 4). The words like "mazao ya ukame" (drought tolerant varieties) means farmers are aware of elements of climate smart agriculture ("kilimo hifadhi") which include use of drought resistant varieties and crops. Also, the word "drip," which mean use of drip irrigation, is highly recommended for climate smart agriculture. As well, the other frequently used words like "mitiki," which means teak trees, are recommended to conserve soil ("udongo") and water ("maji") so as to sustain smallholder farmers livelihoods (Lacombe, Bolliger, Harrison, & Ha., 2016) were found in word cloud.
With the Wordle analysis, it is not easy to determine the frequency of appearance for each word asked by farmers. Thus, we opted to subject analyse the same texts using a different tool for analysis called "TagCrowd." The results after the analysis using TagCrowd is as depicted in Figure 5.
Figure 5. Word cloud after analysis using TagCrowd.
After triangulation of analysis using two word visualization tools, researchers concluded that the most frequent keywords obtained from TagCrowd almost resemble those which were obtained using the Wordle analysis tool (Figure 4, Figure 5). The keywords obtained from TagCrowd tool are: climate, weather, agriculture, soil, water, teak, forestry, rain, drip irrigation, hot temperature, crops, passion, and advisory. These keywords point to the impact of climate change. This is supported by previous literature from a study area which showed that there is impact experienced by farmers due to climate change. Mayala et al. (2015) argue that farmers in Kilosa indicated that there is change of rainfall pattern and resulted to insufficient food and rise in temperature (Isinika et al., 2016). Even though Kilosa District is experiencing the effects of climate change, a study by Mayala et al. (2015) found that farmers in Kilosa have little knowledge on climate change because one in four understand the word "mabadiliko ya tabia nchi," a Swahili word for climate change.
When we searched UshauriKilimo using keyword "mabadiliko ya tabia," we found 4 results. Three farmers asked about the type of crops which they can grow well under limited rainfall. The fourth farmer asked about "why wild animals from Mikumi National Park invade their crops? Is it because of climate change?"
Results from this study show that even though mobile and web-based agro-advisory service systems, after being in use for two years, produced bulk data, evaluating the pattern of data (in terms of words and texts) from its database is a difficult process (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Different researchers have used various qualitative and quantitative data analysis techniques, such as concept mapping, social networks analysis, and content analysis using word visualization tools (Zhu et al., 2015; Cho & Tobias, 2009; Berlanga, Van Rosmalen, Boshuizen, & Sloep, 2012). In our case study, we developed a decision support system (DSS) for data visualization. Also, data visualization was done using Wordle and TagCrowd tools. Furthermore, Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to do additional analysis. This was done by compiling SPSS template with the data related to climate/weather, drought, and irrigation keywords in the questions asked by farmers using their mobile phones. The key words "Hali ya hewa," "ukame," and "umwagiliaji" were used to capture questions on climate change asked by farmers. There were 38 questions and answers related to these three keywords. Table 2 shows the date when the questions were asked, frequency, percentage, and the cumulative frequency (Table 2).

T1  - Econometric analysis of income, productivity and diversification among smallholders in Brazil
AN  - 2082633063
AB  - Family farming plays important roles in agricultural production and the world’s food security. This paper provides an econometric analysis of income, productivity and diversification of Brazilian smallholders. Using the most updated data from the Ministry of Agrarian Development (MDA) enables a more precise analysis than traditional agri-census data. The database contains approximately 4.7 million family farmers from all regions of the country. We used linear and tobit regression to untangle useful information behind these large datasets. The results demonstrated that the smallholders that are part of an agricultural cooperative or a member of a farmer’s association positively affect income, productivity and diversification. The age of household heads is shown to have a non-linear relationship in the three cases, while the household head being female presented a negative effect in all regressions. Although recent technical assistance showed negative impacts on income and productivity, farmer’s assistance positively affected the likelihood of a smallholder diversifying their production and, therefore, becoming less subject to price imbalances. The results support current views in the field of smallholder farming while presenting marked regional differences of a continental country, enabling policy makers to make better, more informed decisions.

T1  - Bio-economic and operational feasibility of introducing oestrus synchronization and artificial insemination in simulated smallholder sheep breeding programmes
AN  - 2056419093
AB  - Low selection intensity due to few selection candidates available at any one time due to thinly spread year-round lambings in villages and prohibitively large nucleus requirements to provide sufficient improved rams to the production tier are the major challenges for designing effective village-based and central nucleus-based breeding programmes, respectively, for smallholder sheep farmers. To tackle these challenges, we used deterministic simulation to design three schemes in village-based programmes introducing hormonal oestrus synchronization (natural oestrus (VNE), single oestrus synchronization (VSE1) and double oestrus synchronization (VSE2)) and three schemes in central nucleus programme introducing artificial insemination (AI) (natural mating with nucleus sizes of 5% (CNM1) and 1% (CNM2) of the total ewe population and natural mating in breeding tier and AI in production tier (CAI)). The schemes were evaluated for their bio-economic and operational feasibility, taking Bonga sheep of Ethiopia as a case study. The selection intensities achieved in VNE, VSE1 and VSE2 were 2.0, 2.3 and 2.4, respectively, for selecting rams for the breeding tier and 0.0, 0.8 and 1.0, respectively, for the production tier. The profits per ewe per year from VNE, VSE1 and VSE2 were Birr 12.2, 21.7 and 24.5, but the profit from VNE for the production tier was zero. CAI generated more genetic gains in the breeding objective (Birr 4.8) than CNM1 (Birr 2.5) and CNM2 (Birr 0.0) in the production tier. However, CAI was less profitable than CNM1 and CNM2. In conclusion, hormonal oestrus synchronization was found to be a feasible technological aide to accelerate genetic progress in village-based programmes. CNM1 and CNM2 could not be recommended as CNM1 requires large nucleus of 10 325 ewes and CNM2 results in zero genetic gain in the production tier. CAI could overcome the challenge in central nucleus programmes, namely unaffordable large nucleus, but the scheme needs to be subsidized by the public sector to be economically feasible for farmers.

T1  - Contested commons: Agricultural modernization, tenure ambiguities and intra-familial land grabbing in Ghana
AN  - 2082633143
AB  - Agricultural land in northern Ghana is a common pool resource predominantly governed by longstanding customary land tenure provisions. Following the renewed emphasis at achieving a new green revolution for Africa since the last decade, the government of Ghana has prioritized the provision of improved land preparation technologies to smallholder farmers. Although the uptake of these technologies has introduced speed and efficiency in land preparation, there are concerns about the impacts on customary land tenure systems. Drawing on the experiences of smallholder farmers (n = 60) in northern Ghana using in-depth interviews, we examine the dynamics in contemporary agricultural land access and governance following decades of progressive agricultural modernization. Our findings show that agricultural modernization has intensified agricultural land use and exposed the customary land governance system to more rival claims over agricultural commons that were previously owned and cultivated collectively under the extended family system. Given the current ambiguities in the interpretation of customary tenure and concomitant intra-familial land grabbing among smallholder farmers which we term ‘intimate dispossession’, most farmers have resorted to diverse personal tenure protection strategies towards enhancing their land use rights at the expense of co-family members. We advocate a land reform that prioritizes formal registration of agricultural lands to avoid future ambiguities in ownership and a cycle of farmland take-overs. With increasing pressure from other competing land uses, land banking should be prioritized to ensure tenure security for smallholder farmers, particularly weaker social groups and individuals within families who are often at risk of intra-familial land grabbing.

T1  - Limits of the New Green Revolution for Africa: Reconceptualising gendered agricultural value chains
AN  - 2047416282
AB  - In order to address food insecurity, the New Green Revolution for Africa (GR4A) promotes tighter integration of African smallholder farmers, especially women, into formal markets via value chains to improve farmers’ input access and to encourage the sale of crop surpluses. This commentary offers a theoretical and practical critique of the GR4A model, drawing on early findings from a five‐year study of value chain initiatives in Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, and Mozambique. It highlights the limitations of a model that views heightened market interactions as uniformly beneficial for smallholder farmers. We challenge the notion that there is a broadly similar and replicable process for the construction of markets and the development of gender‐sensitive value chains in all recipient countries. Instead we build upon the feminist network political ecology and coproduction literatures to conceptualise value chains as complex assemblages co‐produced by a broad set of actors, including socially differentiated farmers.

T1  - IMPACT OF COOPERATIVES MEMBERSHIP ON ECONOMY IN EASTERN OROMIA: THE CASE OF HARAMAYA AGRICULTURAL FARMERS’ COOPERATIVE UNION (HAFCU): ANNALES DE L'ECONOMIE COLLECTIVE
AN  - 2033893961
AB  - This study attempts to analyse the impact of cooperatives on the smallholders’ income, productivity, marketed surplus and saving in East Hararghe Zone of Haramaya District. The study is based on primary cross‐sectional data collected from cooperative member and non‐cooperative member household heads. The propensity score matching (PSM) estimates complemented by a bias correction matching (BCM) and Lewbel instrumental variable (IV) regression estimation shows that cooperatives have a positive impact on smallholders’ income and productivity. The findings have strong policy implications. The rural development of the country should work toward strengthening and expanding the existing rural organizations through training and capacity building programmes. It is important particularly establishing new rural‐based organizations that enable rural households to engage in business activities. Doing that may help reduce poverty and increase smallholders’ income, productivity, and capital accumulation.

T1  - The emerging roles of agricultural insurance and farmers cooperatives on sustainable rice productions in Indonesia
AN  - 2559538193
AB  - Rice is the main staple food of most Asian countries including Indonesia. Most of the rice producers are constituted by small individual farmers characterized with mostly landless, have a less farming capitals and less access to pool resources and of course are confronted with various risk. Agriculture is faced with a lot of uncertainly most of which are not within the control of farmers. Global climatic change, climatic disasters, fluctuation of global economic and competitiveness of multinational company make difficulties of farmers to pursue his sustainable farming activity. The challenge and the role of government is to reduce uncertainly and to improve resiliency of the small farmer. Agriculture insurance shall focus on risk factors that are difficult to manage or cannot be managed by small farmers and it is should be viewed as just one aspect of the “holistic” risk management strategy. Technology, market, consumer, behaviour, development will always move forward, and no individual farmers can adapt this change alone, so small farmers need to corporate with each other that can optimized the resources they have. Cooperative could create possibilities, value added, shortening the supplied chain, made a product more effective and efficient, and finally can complete in domestic and global markets. Therefore, agriculture insurance as well a farmer cooperative may play an important role on sustainability of rice production in Indonesia. Nowadays and in the future agriculture sustainability is a not merely of technology problems but also a matter of economic-social-culture and politic issues within local, national, and international context.

T1  - Farmer groups and inorganic fertiliser use among smallholders in rural South Africa
AN  - 2058577593
AB  - Smallholder farmers in developing countries are characterised by low uptake of improved farm inputs and weak links to markets. Among other reasons, the high transaction costs that these smallholder farmers incur, as a result of their location in remote areas, inadequate information and missing credit markets, inhibit them from participating in both input and output markets. Organising farmers into groups has been suggested as a potential mechanism for reducing transaction costs. Accordingly, farmer groups have been preferred channels for smallholder farmer support in South Africa, both by the government and donors. However, the impact of these groups on smallholder outcomes such as technology adoption is largely unknown. We investigated the extent to which membership in farmer groups influences the use of improved farm inputs such as inorganic fertiliser among smallholder farmers in South Africa. A sample of 984 households was analysed using the propensity score matching method. Group membership was found to play a positive role in inorganic fertiliser use with a 14% higher chance of inorganic fertiliser use among group members. Among fertiliser users, group members used 170 kg more inorganic fertiliser than did non-members. Further analysis indicated that the effect of group membership on inorganic fertiliser use was heterogeneous among group members. The results suggest that farmer groups play a positive role in the use of improved farm inputs in South Africa. For greater effectiveness of group membership, policymakers should target the less educated, increase the assets of the poor and improve access to extension and information.

T1  - Analysis of pearl millet market structure and value chain in India
AN  - 2049557957
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine the market structure and value chain of pearl millet grain and fodder in India. There is a decline in demand for human consumption, with an increase in demand for non-food uses like cattle and poultry feed, raw material for starch and breweries industry. This paper explores alternative channels, uses and value chains of pearl millet grain and fodder. The paper examines in what ways small farmers can benefit from the evolving alternative uses for pearl millet grain in cattle and poultry feed industry, breweries and starch industry. The paper also analyses the impact of aggregators in increasing the efficiency of the value chain.Design/methodology/approachThe study collected primary data from farmers, traders, commission agents and exporters and importers with innovative marketing channels with aggregators (Self-Help Groups) and without aggregators to analyze the prospects for improvements in marketing channels and value chain.FindingsGiven that the production of pearl millet is scattered and thin, there is a lot of scope for market aggregators to increase scale economies to reduce market costs to supply in bulk to food and industrial uses. Although there was some demand for human consumption high-quality grain, most of the future demand will come from cattle and poultry feed industry, breweries and starch industry. To tap these larger potentials, farmers need to aggregate their produce and ensure regular supply in bulk quantity at least to compete the cost with alternative grains like maize and broken rice.Research limitations/implicationsThe research is based on the field-level data collection and observations obtained from Western India. This paper provides insights how the value chain of pearl millet is working and what improvements are needed to make value chain more efficient and inclusive. Although the results are applicable to similar neglected crops and area, more caution is needed.Social implicationsThrough the formation of farmer aggregators, farmers can enhance their bargaining power vis-a-vis industry.Originality/valueTill now, there is no study that explored the pearl millet value chain in detail in India, and the paper tries to fill this literature gap.

T1  - Contract farming: opportunity cost and trade‐offs
AN  - 2033698173
AB  - An important literature has established that participation in contract farming leads to higher incomes and has a number of other beneficial effects on the welfare of participating households. Yet no one has looked at the opportunity cost of and the various trade‐offs involved in participating in contract farming. I look at the relationship between participation in contract farming and income from (i) livestock, (ii) labor markets, (iii) nonfarm businesses, and (iv) agricultural sources other than livestock and contract farming and (v) unearned income. Using data from Madagascar, I find that participation in contract farming is associated with a 79% decrease in how much income per capita the average household derives from labor markets and a 47% decrease in how much income per capita it derives from nonfarm businesses, but also with a 51% increase in how much income per capita the average household derives from agricultural sources other than livestock and contract farming, possibly due to technological spillovers. Thus, even though contract farming has been shown to improve welfare in multiple ways in this context, it looks as though those gains come at the cost of an “agricultural involution” on the part of participating households, who seem to turn away from non‐agricultural activities. This has important implications for structural transformation narratives.

T1  - Redesigning oilseed tree biofuel systems in India
AN  - 2068016128
AB  - Liquid biofuel production has been widely promoted as a rural development strategy in the South. Yet, the development of biofuel value chains faces many context-specific challenges. In this empirical study we use a labelled choice experiment to assess smallholder farmer preferences for alternative production systems, value chain organisations and market developments for a biofuel program using oilseed trees (neem (Azadirachta indica), pongamia (Millettia pinnata), mahua (Madhuca longifolia)) in Karnataka state, India. Our results demonstrate that biofuel programs can benefit from ex ante analyses to improve their design. We find that most farmers (71%) are likely to adopt biofuel trees in most scenarios, especially species with relatively high yields, low labour requirements and high oilseed prices. Nevertheless, value chain reorganization through contracting and labour provision proves to be the key lever to stimulate adoption. This calls for further research on effective contract design and implementation, and for developing alternative business models. Our results imply that next to high opportunity costs of land, also high opportunity costs of labour can be a barrier to biofuel tree adoption. If biofuel programs are to succeed, they have to move beyond the idea of smallholder biofuel production on marginal lands with surplus labour.

T1  - Panama disease and contract farming in the Philippines: Towards a political ecology of risk
AN  - 2017694279
AB  - Despite the vast research on contract farming by agrarian scholars, little is known about interactions between biological risks and the social–political effects of contracts. This study analysed contract farming arrangements in the export banana industry in the Philippines amidst an expanding epidemic of Panama disease. We developed a political ecology of risk approach to investigate how ideas about technological and biological risks are influenced by contractual arrangements, and we borrowed from Cultural Theory the insight that risk and blame are connected concepts, always political, and disadvantage marginalized groups through disproportionate risk burdens. Data collection involved the study of contracts, interviews with decision‐makers, and focus group discussions with agrarian cooperatives. The views of both large corporations as well as organized smallholders were recorded. We found that the former contractually compel the latter to bear the burden of the disease, while blaming them for its spread. Risk decisions were embedded in the dynamics of agrarian social relationships, and economic and political arrangements between actors influenced possibilities and limitations for disease control. We argue that the contractual stipulations, in concert with blaming processes, create a discursive environment that both allow inequitable relations to remain unquestioned, and constrain possibilities for control of Panama disease.

T1  - How Participation in Vegetables Market Affects Livelihoods: Empirical Evidence from Northern Ethiopia
AN  - 2016567892
AB  - Vegetable farmers face a number of challenges in marketing. Having first-hand information about vegetable marketing is essential to devise appropriate strategies aimed at enhancing the value of the vegetable chain. It was in line with this view that the study was conducted to characterize vegetable markets in Northern Ethiopia. In an effort to identify the factors influencing vegetable marketing among farmers, data were collected from 283 farm households who were selected using stratified random sampling. Furthermore, the data were triangulated through focus group discussion (FGD) and key informant interviews. Descriptive statistics and the binary logistic regression model were used to identify the variables and test the probability of their influence in regard to farmers' decisions in vegetable marketing. From the 13 explanatory variables included in the binary logistic regression model, six predictors were found to be statistically significant in determining the effects of participation decision on vegetable market. These variables are as follows: household family size, total land holding of the household, amount of vegetable produced and marketed, use of irrigation technologies, contact with extension agents, and access to market information. Relying on a survey result and observations, the findings of the study indicated that vegetable marketing is significantly improving the livelihood of smallholder producers.

T1  - Macro-Economic and Product Challenges Facing Vietnamese the Pangasius Industry
AN  - 2015348184
AB  - Vietnamese pangasius achieved global status as a highly competitive whitefish as exports to Europe, United States, Asian, and Latin American countries have grown at a rapid pace. Accelerated growth rates have met with a number of challenges that can be potentially converted to opportunities to foster further progress and expansion in exports. This study is a review of literature that examines the various economic and market issues facing the industry in the EU market. The review suggests that at the domestic level farmers must be organized alongside vertical integration to improve quality and supply consistency. Vertical integration may help reduce farm operating costs and increase farmer profit. High interest rates, fluctuating exchange rates, access to credit, lack of capital acquisition by small farmers, and product risks are key economic issues confronting the industry, whereas product quality and standards, product image, and rejection pose financial pressure on farmers, processors, and exporters. The fish, pangasius competes well in the white fish market and key product characteristics are well suited to vertical integration and horizontal differentiation in various and diverse EU markets. The industry may employ a combination of vertical and mixed product differentiation for improved product image and market share expansion in the EU white fish market.

T1  - Trade patterns facilitating highly pathogenic avian influenza virus dissemination in the free‐grazing layer duck system in Vietnam
AN  - 2009435139
AB  - Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses continue to threaten smallholder poultry producers in several South‐east Asian countries, including Vietnam. In particular, the free‐grazing duck system has been repeatedly highlighted as a major risk factor for HPAI outbreaks. Free‐grazing ducks, which scavenge on rice paddies after the harvest, account for a large proportion of the duck population in Vietnam and the wider South‐east Asian region. However, the structure and dynamics of the free‐grazing duck production from farm to consumption has not been described for Vietnam. In this study, we used a value chain approach to provide a complete picture of the actors involved in the production and marketing of free‐grazing duck eggs and spent layer ducks, as well as to investigate the governance structure of this food system. Group interviews and key informant interviews were conducted in two provinces located in the Mekong River Delta (MRD) and the Red River Delta (RRD). The results presented here highlight similarities and differences in farming and trade practices between the two provinces. The trade of spent layer ducks involved large volumes of live ducks being sent to China and Cambodia for consumption, generating a substantial risk of transboundary spread of pathogens, including HPAI viruses. We describe the major role of “duck yards”, which act as hubs in the northbound trade of spent layer ducks. These yards should be considered as essential links in the value chain of spent layer ducks when considering HPAI surveillance and control. The veterinary authorities are only marginally involved in the value chain activities, and their influence could be strengthened by increasing surveillance activities for instance in duck yards. Last, we discuss the dynamics of the duck value chain and further implications for future HPAI management policies.

T1  - Unfair incentives: A behavioural note on sharecropping
AN  - 2009133067
AB  - We conducted a laboratory‐in‐the‐field experiment with real‐life tenants in Ethiopia to test the incentive effects of fixed wage, sharecropping, fixed rent, and ownership contracts. The experimental task resembles a common process in agricultural production. The sharecropping contract is a piece rate scheme framed as a profit‐sharing agreement. Sharecropping output was about 12 percent smaller than the fixed rent output. Surprisingly, it is statistically indistinguishable from the fixed wage output, despite substantial piece rates. This effect is driven by real‐life sharecroppers. Their sharecropping output was smaller than that of non‐sharecroppers, especially in a region where a controversial land reform took place. We argue that our subjects dislike sharecropping contracts because of the unfair profit sharing and the disputed allocation of land. Fairness concerns, therefore, may be another impediment to efficiency under the sharecropping contract.

T1  - Sustainable development of smallholder crop-livestock farming in developing countries
AN  - 2559577440
AB  - Meeting the growing demand for animal-sourced food, prompted by population growth and increases in average per-capita income in low-income countries, is a major challenge. Yet, it also presents significant potential for agricultural growth, economic development, and reduction of poverty in rural areas. The main constraints to livestock producers taking advantage of growing markets include; lack of forage and feed gaps, communal land tenure, limited access to land and water resources, weak institutions, poor infrastructure and environmental degradation. To improve rural livelihood and food security in smallholder crop-livestock farming systems, concurrent work is required to address issues regarding efficiency of production, risk within systems and development of whole value chain systems. This paper provides a review of several forage based-studies in tropical and non-tropical dry areas of the developing countries. A central tenet of this paper is that forages have an essential role in agricultural productivity, environmental sustainability and livestock nutrition in smallholder mixed farming systems.

T1  - Improving Indonesian cinnamon (c. burmannii (Nees & t. nees) Blume) value chains for Greater Farmers Incomes
AN  - 2558798671
AB  - Genus Cinnamomum (Lauraceae) regroups some species whose stem bark are harvested, conditioned and traded as cinnamon in an international market. Over the centuries, the species have been domesticated so that now at least six different ones are grown in Southeast Asia countries. One of the species is Cinnamomum burmannii, also known as Korintje Cinnamon, which generates income for most smallholder farmers in Kerinci district, Jambi, Indonesia. Most cinnamon consumed in the world originates from this Korintje Cinnamon products. It is recognized for its unparalleled quality that comes with its sharp and sweet flavor, with a slightly bitter edge. However, international market requirements for product certification and quality standards make it difficult for a farmer to comply. Our research will address issues related to (improvement of) productivity, sustainability and value chains faced by cinnamon producers in Kerinci, to strengthen their product’s value chains. Smallholder farmers are very vulnerable to climate change impacts, and thus empowering the value chains of agricultural products will increase farmers resilience to climate change. The research will analyze the development of agricultural value chains, certification & standards on trade mechanism to help farmers earn a better income and future prospects.

T1  - Inclusive Businesses and Land Reform: Corporatization or Transformation?
AN  - 2305946012
AB  - Inclusive businesses (IBs), embodying partnerships between commercial agribusinesses and smallholder farmers/low-income communities, are considered to contribute towards rural development and agricultural sector transformation. Structured as complex organizational set-ups consisting of, and overcoming the limitations of, standard inclusive instruments (collective organization, mentorship, supply contract, lease/management contract and equity), they allow for the inclusion of smallholders and low-income communities into commercial agricultural value chains. IBs are a way for governments to engage private agribusinesses in agricultural and rural policies. However, will the commercial sector, through IB partnerships, contribute towards the government’s transformation and developmental objectives? Based on case studies in South Africa—a country engaged in land and agrarian reforms—the effects of IBs at the project level appear positive, illustrated by an increase in production and growth in agricultural assets. However, individual beneficiaries experience only a marginal change in income and livelihoods. Whereas land reform, project development and market integration are generally achieved, the transformation and beneficiary development objectives are compromised. Although commercial agribusinesses contribute to investment needs in the sector and smallholder exposure to commercial markets, IB partnerships allow commercial entities control over the smallholders’ assets. Ownership and secure rights, especially of land, and support of external parties to capacitate beneficiaries and adjust power asymmetries, are essential starting points. Without these aspects, IBs will not lead to effective transformation and development.

T1  - Collective action and rural poverty reduction: Empirical evidence from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
AN  - 2030200633
AB  - Organising smallholder farmers into groups has become an important and preferred mechanism through which the South African government and other rural development agencies seek to address rural poverty and household food insecurity. This study investigates whether collective action through farmer groups has improved incomes among rural farming households in South Africa. The propensity score matching (PSM) method and the treatment effect approach were used to analyse a sample of 984 rural households from four districts in KwaZulu-Natal. The PSM results indicated that participation in farmer groups significantly and positively influenced household incomes. Group membership increased the average household incomes per adult equivalent by about R3000. However, the Rosenbaum bounds tests indicated that the impact estimates obtained using the PSM approach were not robust to hidden bias. The treatment effect regression model, which controls for hidden bias, was estimated, and the results supported those of PSM. The results also indicated that groups benefit more those who are educated and are males, suggesting a bias against the females and those less educated. The results suggest that organising smallholder farmers into groups can play a positive role in rural poverty reduction. For greater impact, policy makers should promote group formation and participation among smallholder farmers as well as introduce adult literacy classes to improve education levels.

T1  - Procedural Justice in Value Chains Through Public–private Partnerships
AN  - 2019057701
AB  - This paper is about making agricultural value chains work for smallholder farmers, and the way that governments can achieve this aim through public-private partnerships (PPPs). Applied to agricultural value chains, PPPs seek to catalyze new investments, support chain upgrading, or improve the performance of poorly functioning chains through joint activities that capitalize on the complementary resources and competencies of public and private partners. Smallholder farmers are frequently the intended beneficiaries. However, there is little understanding of how the terms of value chain participation affect farmer perceptions of and behavior within chains, or the role of the public sector in influencing these arrangements. This paper analyzes in-depth case studies from Ghana, Indonesia, Rwanda, and Uganda to better understand a surprising empirical finding: that farmers that experience strong PPP results in terms of productivity and incomes may nevertheless remain dissatisfied, while those experiencing much more modest gains can view the PPP favorably. At the heart is an analytical framework based on five attributes of "procedural justice". It finds that public sector actors, through PPPs, are able to shape governance within value chains, influencing the relative skills, knowledge, and resources which different actors possess, the way that farmers are organized to engage in the value chain, and the attributes of procedural justice reflected in chain arrangements. Where procedural justice is weak, farmers are more likely to exit or neglect the arrangements, leaving the value chain underperforming with sub-optimal outcomes for all: for farmers, for lead firms, and for government agencies. Government involvement in value chains should be premised on facilitating relationships that are more procedurally just than those which would be expected to arise through the market alone.

T1  - Dynamics of smallholder participation in horticultural export chains: evidence from Ecuador
AN  - 2010065895
AB  - We study the dynamics of smallholder participation in export value chains focusing on the example of small‐scale broccoli producers in the highlands of Ecuador. Combining cross‐sectional data from a household survey with 11‐year longitudinal data on export market transactions, we explain the hazards of dropping out of a high‐value export chain. We apply a multispell cox duration model that allows us to consider multiple entries and exits from the supply chain. We also provide evidence on the welfare impacts associated with participation. The results suggest that small‐scale farmers’ exit from the export sector is accelerated by high transaction risks experienced in the past. While we find no particular evidence for the exclusion of small‐scale farmers from the export sector, we do find that poorer households and female‐headed households tend to drop out faster, especially as long as the sector is still prospering. Finally, when considering welfare effects, we do not find evidence that participation translates into tangible benefits for broccoli farmers. We discuss some measures that could help improve the long‐term sustainability of smallholder integration in high‐value chains.

T1  - Classification of elite cassava varieties (<i>Manihot esculenta</i> Crantz) cultivated in Benin Republic using farmers’ knowledge, morphological traits and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers
AN  - 2259758798
AB  - Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important food security crop or resource for poor rural communities particularly in Africa. The crop’s ability to produce high yields even under poor conditions and storability of its roots underground for longer periods or until needed makes it a model ‘food security crop’. In Benin Republic, cassava has been recognized as one of the major crop contributing towards dynamic value chains generating incomes for small-holder farmers. The crop is grown all over the country, however, the increased production are mainly recorded from far south and central parts of the country. Genetic improvement of cassava in Benin Republic is limited because of poor knowledge of genetic diversity present within the country. The main objective of this study was to assess the genetic diversity and relationships among elite cassava varieties collected from different regions of Benin using fluorescently labelled simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and to compare the results with farmer’s knowledge and morphological traits. A total of 96 cultivars collected from major cassava growing areas such as Southern and Central Benin were classified into 24 different groups using farmers’ knowledge, while classification based on 18 morphological traits resulted in five groups. In total, sixteen SSR markers were tested for molecular analysis of the ninety-six cassava varieties. Among the sixteen, twelve SSR markers gave good banding pattern and were used to genotype the varieties. An average of 3.58 and 0.47 for number of alleles and polymorphism information content respectively was observed. The observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0.23 to 1.0 with an average of 0.66 indicating moderate level of diversity among the cultivars. Based on the proportion of shared alleles and hierarchical clustering, the 96 elite cassava varieties were classified as 74 unique varieties. Principal component analysis and analysis of molecular variance revealed no significant variation between the regions thus, explaining regular exchange of planting materials among cassava farmers across various regions. The moderate level of genetic diversity in famer’s field, revealed in the present study, is a good indication of the need for broadening the genetic base of cassava in Benin Republic and establishing a formal breeding program in the country.

T1  - Smallholders at a crossroad: Intensify or fall behind? Exploring alternative livelihood strategies in a globalized world
AN  - 2121819004; 2018-05492-004
AB  - The chocolate market is experiencing a wave of market differentiation thanks to the emergence of the bean-to-bar movement. Cacao is seeing both a rise in demand for mass markets and a process of market bifurcation into more specialized, high-quality products for wealthy urban consumers. For the specialized market, the quality and origin of the beans are important attributes. Direct trading between chocolate makers and famers seeks to promote the conservation of rare cultivars and traditional agroforestry systems, while lifting farmers out of poverty. Here we assess whether these alternative configurations of the global value chain truly offer smallholders new opportunities, beyond the traditional intensification or marginalization pathways that are generally offered to them. We conducted detailed socio-economic and biophysical surveys with a sample of farms in three of the largest cacao producing provinces of Ecuador. Our results show that, even though smallholders lack the assets needed to join mainstream commodity markets, they have been able to capitalize on the qualities of their traditional varieties to access niche markets. Through strong cooperatives, the knowledge held by buyers about what constitutes a high-quality bean has been transferred to farmers. A unique natural capital may provide smallholders with rewarding pathways to develop their agriculture, exploiting new market opportunities offered by globalization.

T1  - Quality as a driver of sustainable agricultural value chains: The case of the relationship coffee model
AN  - 2121818586; 2018-05492-002
AB  - Specialty coffee markets that recognize coffee-quality price premiums can improve business conditions for smallholders and promote agro-ecological practices. We studied the Relationship Coffee Model (RCM), a business model that supports long-term partnerships between coffee buyers and smallholders based on product quality. We examined how biophysical conditions and production practices affect smallholders’ ability to participate in this model. Furthermore, we considered common unobservable variables driving growers’ participation such as farm soil quality and connection to social networks. In turn, we evaluated key environmental, socioeconomic and technological outcomes, including tree and bird population diversity. Our estimations indicated that RCM participants employed more sustainable resource management practices, had better access to credit and were more informed and optimistic about the coffee business. However, we did not find significant farm-gate price differences. Increased adoption of organic farming and shade-grown systems to elevate coffee quality can stimulate sustainable business strategies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Mapping cassava food value chains in Tanzania's smallholder farming sector: The implications of intra-household gender dynamics
AN  - 2072295082
AB  - A gendered mapping of the structure and coordination (functioning) of traditional cassava value chains is important for marginalized groups such as women in rural development. In contrast to global high value chains, traditional food value chains and associated gender relations as well as power dynamics within households have received little attention. We conducted a cross sectional study in Kigoma, Mwanza, the coastal region, and Zanzibar Island in Tanzania. Data were collected through structured interviews conducted with 228 farmers, combined with key informant interviews, direct observations, repeated household visits, and literature review. The results of the study revealed that there are weak linkages within the cassava value chain, which is highly gendered. While production and processing nodes of the chain, which commenced from villages, were dominated by women and children, women were not well-integrated within high value nodes such as marketing in urban areas and cross-border trading, which were dominated by men. Transportation of cassava to highly lucrative markets was also dominated by men. Cassava processing was conducted at the household level as well as within small-scale cooperatives, with the major portion of this work being done by women. Supporting institutions were found to be involved in the supply of planting material, training, and the provision of processing equipment. In general, men played a prominent role in the control of resources, marketing, and income. In conclusion, the mapping of cassava value chains could help to identify avenues for understanding of poverty, enhancing food security, upgrading capacities, reducing gender inequality, and enhancing women's participation in marketing and income control in the cassava value chains.

T1  - Limitations of Contract Farming as a Pro-poor Strategy: The Case of Maize Outgrower Schemes in Upper West Ghana
AN  - 2007969147
AB  - Contract farming (CF) arrangements have the potential to address market failures and improve technology adoption, productivity, and welfare. In Ghana, government and donors use CF as a strategy for increasing adoption of new agricultural technologies and developing value chains. Yet to date, there has not been a rigorous assessment of these CF schemes. The focus in this paper is on different maize-based CF schemes in the poorest and most remote region in Ghana. It assesses the profitability and potential impact of these CF schemes, utilizing a unique plot-level dataset that covers two periods of data and two maize plots (scheme and non-scheme) per household, and employing matching techniques and an instrumental variable approach to address selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity across farmers. These are complemented by a community-level survey, in-depth interviews with scheme operators, and a series of key informant interviews. Results show that these schemes led to improved technology adoption and yield increases. In addition, a subset of maize farmers with high yield improvements due to CF participation have high profits. Maize CF schemes also enabled market coordination and consistent supply of quality maize to downstream industries. However, on average, the impact of the CF schemes on profitability is negative, even when input diversion is accounted for. Yield increases are not high enough to compensate for higher input requirements and the cost of capital under the schemes. Despite higher yields, the costs to produce one metric tonne of maize under CF schemes are higher than on maize farms without CF schemes, twice that of several countries in Africa, and more than seven times higher than that of major maize-exporting countries (the United States, Brazil, and Argentina). Sustainability of these CF schemes will largely depend on developing and promoting much-improved varieties and technologies that boost yields in order to compensate for the high input and credit costs.

T1  - Smallholders at a Crossroad: Intensify or Fall behind? Exploring Alternative Livelihood Strategies in a Globalized World
AN  - 1994685335
AB  - The chocolate market is experiencing a wave of market differentiation thanks to the emergence of the bean-to-bar movement. Cacao is seeing both a rise in demand for mass markets and a process of market bifurcation into more specialized, high-quality products for wealthy urban consumers. For the specialized market, the quality and origin of the beans are important attributes. Direct trading between chocolate makers and famers seeks to promote the conservation of rare cultivars and traditional agroforestry systems, while lifting farmers out of poverty. Here we assess whether these alternative configurations of the global value chain truly offer smallholders new opportunities, beyond the traditional intensification or marginalization pathways that are generally offered to them. We conducted detailed socio-economic and biophysical surveys with a sample of farms in three of the largest cacao producing provinces of Ecuador. Our results show that, even though smallholders lack the assets needed to join mainstream commodity markets, they have been able to capitalize on the qualities of their traditional varieties to access niche markets. Through strong cooperatives, the knowledge held by buyers about what constitutes a high-quality bean has been transferred to farmers. A unique natural capital may provide smallholders with rewarding pathways to develop their agriculture, exploiting new market opportunities offered by globalization.

T1  - Connecting supermarkets and farms: the role of intermediaries in Walmart China's fresh produce supply chains
AN  - 1992858243
AB  - This paper identifies and describes the recent emergence of a new class of private sector intermediaries in fresh fruit and vegetable (FFV) supermarket supply chains in China. These intermediaries play key roles that determine the ways in which farm households participate in and the benefits they derive from new retail-led market opportunities associated with the supermarket sector's shift from FFV procurement through wholesale markets towards more direct contracting with farm communities. This paper provides a comprehensive description of 198 FFV supply chain intermediaries working with Walmart China in 2014, including their historical background, infrastructure investments, downstream marketing and upstream sourcing. We find that these actors play an increasingly critical role in the organization of land, labor and production through contracts. Our study provides critical insights for understanding both the trends in vertical coordination of China's developing agricultural sector and the pace of the country's agricultural modernization. Walmart is a leading international supermarket chain with a growing presence in China, and evidence suggests that their supply chain strategies are similar to other large supermarkets in the region. Results are also relevant to understanding current challenges in China related to food safety and quality, a top priority in recent years.

T1  - Structure and impact of cattle manure trade in crop-livestock systems of Vietnam
AN  - 1992858241
AB  - Cattle manure value chains play important biological and economic roles in smallholder crop-livestock systems in developing countries, but relative to other livestock products our understanding of the nature and impact of manure sales is limited. In regions with an active manure trade, farmers face a choice between manure use on-farm and sales, which affects nutrient flows and participant incomes. We analyzed the manure value chain operating in south-central Vietnam as an example of the function and role of manure trade in crop-livestock systems. Lowland cattle farmers sell manure through a network of chain participants, including small-scale collectors, lowland and highland traders, to pepper, coffee, dragon fruit and rubber farms in the central highlands and southeast coast. We collected and summarized quantitative data (e.g., manure-related labor, manure transactions, and fertilizer and manure use) gathered in semi-structured interviews with value-chain participants [lowland cattle owners (n = 101), traders (n = 27) and end users (n = 72)]. Lowland cattle owners were selected by stratified random sampling, and subsequent participants were identified in preceding interviews. One key finding concerns the seasonality of the manure value chain: most manure flowed between February and August (lowland dry season and period of peak highland demand) from lowland communes to highland coffee and pepper farms for use as organic soil amendments. Fewer sales occurred, at a lower price, to southeast coastal dragon fruit farms and rubber companies. Value addition to manure occurred via drying, bagging, collection, transport and composting. The presence of local traders facilitated market sales for smallholder cattle owners, and prices through the value chain generally reflected costs for value addition. The geographic distribution of cattle relative to agricultural land influenced the flow of manure, with net outflows from regions with higher animal density to regions with lower density and higher value crop production. Manure trade was an important source of supplementary income for farmers and a primary livelihood activity for traders. Value chain participant net incomes ranged from near US$100 yr-1 for lowland farmers to over US$13,000 yr-1 for traders, and returns to labor were just over US$0.50 h-1 for lowland farmers and US$2 h-1 for traders. The quantitative information generated during our descriptive assessment provides an important first step toward manure value chain improvement, indicates survey methods that can be applied in other areas, and identifies next steps necessary to evaluate chain evolution and resilience.

T1  - Building value chains for indigenous fruits: lessons from camu-camu in Peru
AN  - 1992858237
AB  - Governments and NGOs have enthusiastically promoted value chains for lesser-known indigenous fruits in the pursuit of poverty reduction and other development goals. This paper examines experiences in Peru in building the value chain for camu-camu--a fruit native to the Amazon that is in the process of being domesticated. We look at interventions to build the chain, the environment in which the chain operates, the implications of chain development on livelihoods, and prospects for future chain development. Information was collected from gray literature as well as from primary data from household and key informant interviews. The results of this study suggest that the emergence of the camu-camu chain has led to higher farm income without generating large trade-offs in livelihood activities or the environment. However, the results also demonstrate an unrealized potential to achieve greater impact at scale due to gaps in services and inputs, limited coordination among farmers and chain actors, and a risky business environment. Building value chains for lesser-known fruits will require more than a techo-managerial focus on smallholder production. Greater attention is required to build stronger public-private collaboration to expand and diversify markets, with particular attention on strengthening institutions and growing local markets for high-value products.

T1  - Contracting and gender equity in Tanzania: using a value chain approach to understand the role of gender in organic spice certification
AN  - 1992857364
AB  - Value chain development (VCD) initiatives within the horticultural and organic sectors in Africa are promising strategies to improve smallholder welfare. Contracting institutional arrangements are a common feature of VCD initiatives and are increasing in number in sub-Saharan Africa as a way to source organic products from smallholder producers. The objective of this study is to better understand men and women's participation in spice producing households that sell under contract and in conventional market chains in the East Usambaras, Tanzania. We draw on New Institutional Economics, political economy and the value chain analysis framework to assess the potential role of contracting to promote gender equity among smallholder organic horticultural producers. We describe intra-household decision making over resources and marketing, access to benefits of contracting, and labor distribution between men and women in contracting and non-contracting households. We then extend the gender analysis to evaluate the role of gender in contracting and conventional value chains operating within the community and district. Using a cross-sectional research design and data collected through 13 focus group discussions, 54 personal interviews and 156 household questionnaires, we show that contracting reduces transaction costs in the chain compared with the conventional trade. However, norms in the wider political economic context give rise to gendered patterns of participation in both household and chain activities in contracting and non-contracting households. Our findings suggest that contracting does not provide significant opportunities for women in married households to participate and benefit based on limited participation in decision-making and access to trainings. Divorced women and widows gain access to contract employment opportunities to earn income. This study highlights the importance of understanding gender relations in the household and community to guide the development of gender equitable VCD initiatives and contracting approaches.

T1  - Linking Individual and Collective Agency for Enhancing Community Resilience in Northern Ghana
AN  - 1984282593
AB  - This article aims to explore the relationship between individual adaptive actions and enhancement of community resilience to climate change as a communal objective. It proposes to pay attention to the concept of reflexivity as the primary individual capacity to link adaptive actions and community resilience. Drawing on the field research conducted in northern Ghana in 2015, this article specifically examines life histories of four small farmers and shows that they individually take adaptive actions and reflect on these actions. However, little opportunity exists for them to systematically communicate the reflections with others to learn from their experiences, nurture collective agency and enhance community resilience. The article concludes by outlining new strategies needed to facilitate the communication in particular cultural and policy contexts.

T1  - Capital Strategy in Diversification Farming Efforts Using SWOT Analysis
AN  - 2571965396
AB  - Wetland farm diversification program in the district of Bojonegoro, Tulungagung, and Ponorogo can not provide an optimal contribution to the income of farmers caused because farmers are not able to cultivate high value-added commodities due to limited capital. This study aims to identify the characteristics of farming, capital pattern, stakeholder role, to analyze farming to know the pattern of planting suggestions and prospects, and to formulate capital facilitation strategy. Farming capital is obtained through loans in financial institutions with different patterns. Small farmers tend to utilize savings and credit cooperatives, microcredit, and loan sharks, while farmers with large wetland holdings tend to utilize commercial banks. P enelitian using descriptive method of farming profit analysis, and SWOT. The government through the banking institutions have provided much facilitation in the form of low-interest loans with flexible payment method. The generic strategy of selected capital facilitation is to empower farmers through farmer groups who have the capability in managing the capital needs of their members.

T1  - Effect of input credit on smallholder farmers’ output and income: Evidence from Northern Ghana
TT  - Effect of input credit
AN  - 2534619160
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of input credit on smallholder farmers’ output and income using Masara N’Arziki support project in Northern Ghana.Design/methodology/approachA cross-sectional primary data set was used to estimate the effect of project participation on farm output, yield and income using propensity score matching (PSM) methods.FindingsThe findings are that project participation is skewed towards experienced farmers with big-sized households and farms. The effect of project on outcomes is somewhat unsatisfactory in the sense that participation only raises output and yield, but not income.Research limitations/implicationsThe paper only examined the project effect on farm outcomes among smallholder farmers participating in the programme in just one operational area in the Northern region. Future research should consider all the operational areas for an informed generalisation of findings.Practical implicationsGreater benefits to farmers from programme participation would require project management to review the contractual arrangement so that the high cost of input credit is significantly reduced.Originality/valueThe paper applied the PSM to estimate the effect of project participation on farm output, yield and income among smallholder farmers which is non-existent in the literature on the study area, at least as far as we know. This paper can inform future policy on the direction and nature of support for smallholder farmers in Northern Ghana.

T1  - Unlocking the Household ‘Black Box’: A Gendered Analysis of Smallholder Farmers' Participation in the Cassava (Manihot esculenta crantz) Value Chain in Tanzania
AN  - 2209691485
AB  - Women in developing countries are often omitted from key parts of the agricultural value chains. We used household survey data in bi‐probit and ordinary least squares regression models to estimate the determinants of women's participation in cassava cultivation and marketing in Tanzania. Land size and region, among other factors, were significant determinants of household decisions to grow cassava. Policies for improving women's land rights and infrastructure would help to promote their participation in cassava production, processing and marketing. Improved methods of delivering extension information would also improve women's participation in the cassava value chain markets. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - How to improve smallholder market access: Evaluation of Mercados Campesinos in Colombia
AN  - 2184517192
AB  - This paper presents an analysis of the results obtained in the project called “Mercados Campesinos” carried out in the central region of Colombia between 2004 and 2015. This analysis was performed to evaluate the impacts of this short food value chain experience and its influence on economic, social and political dimensions of smallholders’ market access.
The analysis included two complementary research methods: quantitative and qualitative approaches. These methods were stated to identify the benefits accrued to participants using
three different methodologies: i) t-test analysis; ii) an impact evaluation known as difference-in-difference and iii) multilevel regressions. On the other hand, qualitative analysis was based on semi-structured interviews and informal dialogues to investigate the perceptions of a selected group of beneficiaries regarding how project goals have been achieved. The results showed that one of the most influential elements in smallholders’market access has been the role of peasant organizations, associations and local farmer committees. These administrative structures greatly affected the economic efficiency, political participation and, to a lesser extent, commercial improvements. Project outcomes have been extremely influenced by participants’ expectations of improvements in wellbeing, life quality, production rates, and income. The project was not able to reach a good level of financial sustainability; however, it provided peasants with well-designed tools to self-coordinate their actions. Proof of that is that farmers started to organize themselves autonomously to exert pressure at municipal and local levels.

T1  - Analysing the value chain for African leafy vegetables in Limpopo Province, South Africa
AN  - 2178531106
AB  - The aim of this study has been to analyse the value chain of African leafy vegetables in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. This was done by identifying the prominent value chain actors, institutions governing the chain, the infrastructural endowments, key factors and challenges affecting the success or failure of the value chains for African leafy vegetables. Relationships among the value chain actors were weak, with transactions based mostly on spot markets. While smallholder farmers attain high gross margins, their intention to take part in the mainstream markets are prevented by lack of technical advice on production, lack of packaging and processing services, poor infrastructure, deficiency of contractual agreements between actors, and lack of access to finance. Although producers currently attain relatively higher gross margins, more benefits might be realized if government services (such as training, seed production and distribution) could either be decentralized or privatized. Future policy interventions should focus on promoting value addition along the African leafy vegetable chain, provision of cold storage facilities by municipalities closer to smallholder farmers in the rural areas and this will stabilize farm gate prices to encourage continuation of production.

T1  - Maize value chain analysis: A case of smallholder maize production and marketing in selected areas of Malawi and Mozambique
AN  - 2176699735
AB  - This article analyzes maize value chain performance in Malawi and Mozambique using data collected from a market study commissioned by the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture. The results show that although smallholder maize productivity is slightly higher in Malawi, a maize value chain analysis indicates that smallholder maize in Mozambique is more competitive. Mozambique has a relatively higher competitive advantage with regard to maize production because of the relatively lower input costs, perhaps due to its proximity to the coast, which invariably reduces input costs relative to its land-locked neighbor, Malawi. However, smallholder maize productivity is low in both countries, when compared to the regional average. The article concludes that interventions aimed at raising smallholder productivity would invariably make smallholder farmers more competitive. It proposes policy implications aimed at raising the productivity and trade competitiveness of maize, as this will ensure the overall productivity of the maize-based smallholder farming system in the two countries.

T1  - Income diversification and food security situation in Ethiopia: A review study
AN  - 2169556956
AB  - This review was conducted to examine the income diversification and food security situation in Ethiopia. The objective is specifically to identify the determinants of income diversification of smallholder farmers, and its effect on food security status of rural households and to review the determinants of food security status of households. Agriculture is the basic economic sector in which the country relies for its social and economic development. In spite of the fact that 80% of the population has been employed in food production, it fails to feed relatively large proportion of population from its domestic production. In Ethiopia, 83% of small-holder farmers participated in farming activities and only 27% were engaged in non-farm/off-farm economic enterprises. Non-farm employment provides additional income that enables farmers to spend more on their basic needs include food, education, cloth and health care services. Food security exists when all people at all times have the physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for active and healthy life. The basic factors influencing the food security status of small-holder farmers are the socioeconomic characteristics and resources of individual households. To make considerable improvement on food security situation, action should be taken by household heads, government of Ethiopia, national and international organizations.

T1  - Factors affecting market outlet choices of pepper producers in Wonberma district, Northwest Ethiopia: multivariate probit approach
AN  - 2169555961
AB  - Pepper is an important cash crop for its contribution to income-generating, employment opportunity and improvement of food security to the majority of the rural households. However, enhancing pepper producers to reach the market is a key issue needed in Wonberma district. This study sought to analyze determinants of market outlet choices among smallholder pepper producers in Wonberma district of West Gojjam Zone of Amhara Region, Ethiopia. Both primary and secondary source of data were used to collect qualitative and quantitative data. Two-stage sampling method was used and data were collected from 130 pepper producers. Multivariate probit (MVP) model was used to analyze factors affecting market outlet choices of smallholder pepper producers. The MVP model results indicated that quantity of pepper produced, pepper farming experience, extension contact, year of schooling, bargaining power of the producer; post-harvest value addition, market distance, and livestock ownership had a statistically significant influence on choices of the market outlet. Therefore, this study underscores increasing productivity of pepper; enhancing post harvest value addition practices, improve farmers bargaining power through cooperative; strengthen institutional services and infrastructure development like road and transportation facility for policy implication.

T1  - Factors affecting market outlet choice of wheat producers in North Gondar Zone, Ethiopia
AN  - 2158441798
AB  - Background 
Selecting the appropriate channels to deliver farm products is not an easy task because there are various factors that affect producers to select such relevant channels. Hence, the study was aimed to investigate the factors that influence market channel choices among wheat producers in Northwestern Ethiopia.
 Methods 
Using multistage sampling technique, 163 smallholder wheat producers were selected to collect primary data through semi-structures questionnaires. Combinations of data analysis methods such as descriptive statistics and econometrics model (multivariate probit model) were used.
 Result and conclusion 
The study identified four major wheat market channel choices such as retailers, assemblers, consumers and wholesalers as alternatives to wheat producers to sell majority of their products. Thus, retailers who accounted for 40.49% of total sold, assemblers (39.2%), consumers (37.5%) and wholesalers (23.93%). The results of a multivariate probit model indicated that age of household, education status, credit access; livestock number, off-farm income and total land-holding size of farmers significantly affected the market channel choice decisions in one or another way. Therefore, strengthening institutions to deliver timely and appropriate credit service and training to a farmer is among the major recommendations from this study.

T1  - Exploring the integration of business and CSR perspectives in smallholder souring
AN  - 2126927759
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of smallholder supply chains on sustainable sourcing to answer the question how food and agribusiness multinationals can best include smallholders in their sourcing strategies and take social responsibility for large-scale sustainable and more equitable supply. A sustainable smallholder sourcing model with a list of critical success factors (CSFs) has been applied on two best-practise cases. In this model, business and corporate social responsibility perspectives are integrated.Design/methodology/approachThe primary data of the value chain analyses of the two smallholder supply chains of a food and agribusiness multinational have been applied. Both cases were of a join research program commissioned by the multinational and a non-governmental organization using the same methods and research tools. Similarities, differences and interference between the cases have been determined and assessed in order to confirm, fine tune or adjust the CSFs.FindingsBoth cases could be conceptualized through the smallholder sourcing model. Most CSFs could be found in both cases, but differences were also found, which led to fine tuning of some CSFs: building of a partnership and effective producers organization, providing farm financing and the use of cross-functional teams in smallholder supplier development programs. It was also concluded that the smallholder sourcing model is applicable in different geographical areas.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings of this study are based on just two cases. More best-practise cases are recommended in order to confirm or to adjust the developed sourcing model and the CSFs.Originality/valueThis paper/research fills the need in sustainable supply chain management literature to study supply chains that comply with the triple bottom line concept, rather than supply chains that are just more “green.”

T1  - Determinants of livelihood diversification strategies in Eastern Tigray Region of Ethiopia
AN  - 2109047602
AB  - Background 
In Ethiopia, farm households engage and pursue diverse off-farm and non-farm livelihood activities to cope with diverse challenges such as drought. Due to the unstable and meagre agricultural context of the study area, farm income alone could not feed the ever increasing population. Without adopting context based livelihood diversification strategies; the challenge it presents could neither meet nor attain household food security and improve livelihood security. The objective of the study was to analyse the determinants of livelihood diversification strategies among rural households in Eastern Tigray Region of Ethiopia.
 Methods 
Multistage sampling technique was used in selecting the study sites and 485 sample respondents. Data were triangulated with information collected using focus group discussion and key informants interview to draw qualitative conclusion.
 Results 
Majority (83.1%) of the farmers were able to diversify their livelihoods into either off-farm or non-farm or combined income activities, whereas the remaining 16.91% of the households were unable to diversify; often lacking the means to engage in any form of income-generating activity apart from agricultural activities. Results of the multinomial logistic regression model revealed that households choice and adoption of livelihood diversification strategies were positively affected by households level of education, access to credit, income, membership to cooperatives, land size, and farm input use, whereas age, dependency ratio, family size, access to extension services, distance to market, livestock ownership and agro-ecology negatively affected.
 Conclusions 
Diversification into non-farm activities plays a significant role in the context of inadequate and rain-fed-dependent agricultural income households. Households who diversified their livelihood activities are the ones who able to build better asset and less vulnerable than the undiversified ones. Smallholder farmers’ food security and livelihood improvement can only be realized if the government give due attention and put the right policy measures in place that support non-farm livelihood diversification as part of national job creation for saving life of many people and better livelihood.

T1  - Prevalence and mitigation of aflatoxins in Kenya (1960-to date)
AN  - 2105084583
AB  - Aflatoxins are highly toxic metabolites of several Aspergillus species widely distributed throughout the environment. These toxins have adverse effects on humans and livestock at a few micrograms per kilogram (μg/kg) concentrations. Strict regulations on the concentrations of aflatoxins allowed in food and feed exist in many nations in the developing world. Loopholes in implementing regulations result in the consumption of dangerous concentrations of aflatoxins. In Kenya, where ‘farm-to-mouth’ crops become severely contaminated, solutions to the aflatoxins problem are needed. Across the decades, aflatoxins have repeatedly caused loss of human and animal life. A prerequisite to developing viable solutions for managing aflatoxins is understanding the geographical distribution and severity of food and feed contamination, and the impact on lives. This review discusses the scope of the aflatoxins problem and management efforts by various players in Kenya. Economic drivers likely to influence the choice of aflatoxins management options include historical adverse health effects on humans and animals, cost of intervention for mitigation of aflatoxins, knowledge about aflatoxins and their impact, incentives for aflatoxins safe food and intended scope of use of interventions. It also highlights knowledge gaps that can direct future management efforts. These include: sparse documented information on human exposure; few robust tools to accurately measure economic impact in widely unstructured value chains; lack of long-term impact studies on benefits of aflatoxins mitigation; inadequate sampling mechanisms in smallholder farms and grain holding stores/containers; overlooking social learning networks in technology uptake and lack of in-depth studies on an array of aflatoxins control measures followed in households. The review proposes improved linkages between agriculture, nutrition and health sectors to address aflatoxins contamination better. Sustained public awareness at all levels, capacity building and aflatoxins related policies are necessary to support management initiatives.

T1  - Nucleus-outgrower schemes as an alternative to traditional smallholder agriculture in Tanzania – strengths, weaknesses and policy requirements
AN  - 2098067504
AB  - The public debate about the right type of agriculture for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) often constructs a dichotomy between smallholders and large-scale agriculture. This over-simplification ignores some important intermediary forms for organising agriculture, including nucleus-outgrower schemes (NOSs). NOSs promise to combine the benefits of both while potentially reducing, though not avoiding, (part of) their drawbacks. This article analyses the conditions under which NOSs are feasible and beneficial for investors, outgrowers and rural development for selected value chains in Tanzania. It is based on an empirical study comprising 276 qualitative interviews with various stakeholders conducted in central Tanzania in spring 2015 on 10 NOSs in three subsectors (rice, sugar cane and tea) in different stages of realisation (planning, establishment, full production and failure or near-failure). The study examines why investments succeed or fail in different stages, the socio-economic impacts and various policies important for their fate. Findings show that there are many challenges to successfully implementing NOSs in Tanzania, including national policies on the business environment, on agriculture in general and on specific subsectors, and, especially, on land issues. Nevertheless, these schemes seem to have considerable potential to support local development, particularly by providing employment and salaries, incomes for outgrower farmers, infrastructure and corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects as compensation for loss of access to land for the community. The specific details of a particular business model influence the opportunities and risks, but no single model seems to be superior; much depends on the subsector structure and the services already available. In general, policies to attract and steer NOSs in Tanzania are not yet sufficiently developed, coordinated or implemented.

T1  - Maize seed systems in different agro-ecosystems; what works and what does not work for smallholder farmers
AN  - 2098066342
AB  - Maize is a food field crop with a highly developed formal seed sector. The study reported here, involving 4 case studies in Malawi, Zambia, the state of Chiapas in Mexico and the state of Bihar in India, indicates that smallholder farmers are increasingly purchasing seed from the formal maize seed system in these different parts of the world. Points of sale vary from seed agent and agro-dealer to the local rural market. Many farmers are growing hybrid varieties, although, in particular, under conditions where higher yields justify seed costs, and with the objective of maize grain sales rather than home consumption, for which traditional varieties continue to be grown. While the findings indicate well-functioning seed value chains in the areas of study, producer surveys and seed value chain analysis also pointed to significant weak links in the formal maize seed systems that need to be improved, such as certification and seed quality control at point of sale, and the availability of financial services to support investments by farmers in quality seed and in seed entrepreneurship. The seed subsidy programs in Malawi and Zambia are likely to have stimulated the use of hybrid seed, but it is questionable whether farmers will continue to purchase hybrid seed if subsidies cease to be available. Although the 4 areas of study are relatively well developed, still a genuine demand for improved open pollinated varieties (IOPVs), local varieties and/or on-farm seed saving was identified. Therefore it should be recognized that even for maize, in addition to the private formal seed value sector based on hybrid varieties, there remains a task for public maize breeding efforts and farmer based maize seed systems for the foreseeable future.

T1  - Food value chain linkages and household food security in Tanzania
AN  - 2098066335
AB  - This article investigates smallholder market linkages in food value chains in sub-Saharan Africa, using Tanzania as a case study. Specifically, we analysed the status and drivers of market linkages among farmers, and their impact on agricultural income and food security. The analysis is based on nationally representative household survey data, using a combination of descriptive statistics and econometric approaches. Although most farmers in Tanzania are integrated into agricultural markets, their level of commercialization is very low, with an average of only 30% of their crop production sold. Around 15% of farmers who sell crops have access to potentially more rewarding market linkages (e.g. through cooperatives or contract farming). The econometric results show that, controlling for a number of confounding factors, farmers with market linkages are more commercialized, and receive significantly higher producer prices and crop income than those without such linkages. However, in spite of these positive results, we did not find significant differences in terms of household food security.

T1  - ScalA-FS: expert-based ex-ante assessments of local requirements and success potential of upgrading strategies for improving food security in rural Tanzania
AN  - 2098065792
AB  - Enhancing food security is the main goal of subsistence farmers, who are vulnerable to food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa. Participatory research across food value chains (FVC) can help stabilize and enhance food security by developing upgrading strategies (UPS). However, prior to successful widespread adoption and geographical upscaling, such practices need in-depth understanding of their suitability in target areas and their particular local requirements. Ex-ante assessments of selected UPS were carried out by German and Tanzanian agricultural scientists using the “ScalA-FS” tool. The participating experts included those responsible for implementation. The tool aims to systematically evaluate, at the community level, UPS that have been successfully implemented elsewhere, evaluate their potential for dissemination, and identify entry points for adjustments during implementation. Assessment indicators were developed through a participatory process. UPS relate to a) natural resource management and crop production; b) food processing and bioenergy; c) income generation and market participation; and d) food consumption. Here we present the ScalA-FS assessment results on UPS suitability as well as on its implementation requirements. We focused on the local context needed to enable a productive collaboration between smallholder farmers and implementing research and/or development organizations. Implementation requirements for the selected UPS were assessed as generally low to medium, and projected suitability in most cases was high. Local knowledge and education (human capital) along with visible success after a short time were important criteria of success of UPS. Here, careful consideration of the challenges before and after implementation of UPS is suggested. ScalA-FS should be applied early in the implementation process of UPS in order to support adaptations and successful upscaling at other locations.

T1  - Small farmers’ preferences for weather index insurance: insights from Kenya
AN  - 2090350529
AB  - BackgroundSmallholder farmers in developing countries are particularly vulnerable to climate shocks but often lack access to agricultural insurance. Weather index insurance (WII) could reduce some of the problems associated with traditional, indemnity-based insurance programs, but uptake has been lower than expected. One reason is that WII contracts are not yet sufficiently tailored to the needs and preferences of smallholder farmers. This study combines survey and choice-experimental data from Kenya to analyze the experience with an existing WII program and how specific changes in the contractual design might encourage uptake.ResultsMany smallholders struggle with fully understanding the functioning of the program, which undermines their confidence. Regular provision of relevant rainfall measurements and thresholds would significantly increase farmers’ willingness to pay for WII. Mechanisms to reduce basis risk are also positively valued by farmers, although not to the same extent as higher levels of transparency. Finally, offering contracts to small groups rather than individual farmers could increase insurance uptake.ConclusionsBetter training on WII and regular communication are needed. Group contracts may help to reduce transaction costs. Farmer groups can also be important platforms for learning about complex innovations, including novel risk transfer products. These concrete results are specific to Kenya; however, they provide some broader policy-relevant insights into typical issues of WII in a small-farm context.

T1  - Factors affecting marketing channel choice decisions of smallholder Citrus growers
AN  - 2088867268
AB  - PurposeDespite the fact that citrus industry is growing in Pakistan where production is dominated by small-scale citrus growers, no research has been done to evaluate and analyse the marketing channel choice decision-making process of these citrus growers. The purpose of this paper is to review the existing factors affecting decision making of small-size citrus growers in citrus supply chain in Pakistan and also measures and analyses the factors that affect the marketing channel decisions of these small size growers.Design/methodology/approachA multivariate decision analysis technique, conjoint analysis, was used to analyse and evaluate the major factors affecting marketing channel choice decisions of small-size citrus growers.FindingsIt was concluded that among nine very important factors, six factors played a major role in the marketing channel choice decision making. Only three factors namely, “price”, “time of complete fruit picking” and “number of fruit pickings” were considered highly important factors and reflected that citrus growers not only want to secure his payments but also to save their orchards for next season(s).Research limitations/implicationsThe research would provide valuable information about citrus grower’s marketing decision-making process and thus would contribute to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of citrus industry in Pakistan.Originality/valueThis analysis would suggest them to make rational decisions and help choosing them the most appropriate combination of different levels of different factors which would increase their profits. This study identifies the most relevant factors and their levels which citrus growers and pre-harvest contractors preferred in citrus marketing channel choice decision making, thus, server as a guideline for the buyer’s to deal with them accordingly. This would improve the efficiency and reduce the transaction cost along the citrus supply chain in Pakistan.

T1  - Does contract farming improve profits and food safety? Evidence from tomato cultivation in Nepal
AN  - 2088474169
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to quantify the benefits of contract farming (CF) on farmers’ income and adoption of food safety measures (FSMs) at the farm level. The paper also investigates the determinants of participation in CF.Design/methodology/approachThe study is based on a survey of 600 tomato farmers from Nepal. Descriptive statistics, regression analysis (using instrumental variable) and propensity score matching have been used to accomplish the objectives of the study.FindingsThe study found that the CF ensures higher returns to farmers as well as higher adoption of FSMs at the farm level. The contract farmers earned about 38 per cent higher net returns and had 38 per cent higher adoption of FSM as compared to independent farmers. Caste, occupation, farm size and cropping intensity significantly affected farmers’ participation in CF.Research limitations/implicationsThe analysis based on cross-section data has limitations to consider unobserved farmer-level individual heterogeneity.Originality/valueThis study will provide an empirical base to promote CF in Nepal. The study will also contribute to bridge the gap in literature on the drivers of CF and its impact on smallholders’ income and compliance with FSM in Nepal.

T1  - Coordinating cereal farmers and buyers: evidence from Mali
AN  - 2049558557
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine how various transaction-cost characteristics influence the choice of vertical coordination (VC) structures (e.g. different contract types) and horizontal coordination (HC) structures (e.g. different farmer organization types) to link smallholder farmers efficiently with buyers. It analyzes the relationship between vertical and horizontal structures, and the economic sustainability of different structure combinations.Design/methodology/approachThe paper develops a conceptual framework to predict coordination structures as a function of transaction-cost characteristics, compares predictions for the Malian cereals market to empirical evidence using 15 case studies, and then analyzes structure combinations.FindingsAsymmetric scale between farmers and buyers; uncertainty in production, prices, policy, and contract enforcement; and quality and quantity debasement lead to selections of structures with high levels of control. Vertical and horizontal structures demonstrate a complementary relationship in certain core coordination roles, while exhibiting substitutability in the provision of other coordination activities. The marketing cooperative and marketing contract pairing is the most prevalent combination.Research limitations/implicationsThe conceptual framework is useful for explaining the selection of coordination structures, and can be applied in other contexts to strengthen external validity.Originality/valueThe framework facilitates predictions and explanation of both VC and HC structures, with empirical application on a country and value chains receiving little attention in the literature.

T1  - Strengthening Collective Action to Improve Marketing Performance: Evidence from Farmer Groups in Central Africa
AN  - 2034281222; EJ1171994
AB  - Purpose: Several development organisations have implemented programs to enhance smallholder farmers' crop productivity and market access through collective action with mixed results. Therefore, this study examines the drivers of success of collective action initiatives as a pathway to improving farmers marketing performance using data from Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses primary data collected from 30 farmer groups through focus group discussions. These groups are assessed for differences in their marketing performance using descriptive and cluster analysis techniques. Findings: Most of the group members are poor (67%) and few are considered as rich (2%) or middle class (28%), while the rest are destitute. The destitute community members are often excluded from the groups due to their own passivity and inability to contribute financial resources for joint activities. Mature farmer groups with strong internal structures and greater participation in product bulking as well as formally organised groups with stable external links significantly have higher marketing performance. Practical implications: We recommend that for farmers to maximise the benefits of collective action, supportive policies are necessary to encourage the formation of groups and transform existing ones into business entities to access high-value markets and perhaps even export markets. Farmer groups need to intensify their market research to access ready and stable markets such as supermarkets and institutions with larger volumetric requirements. Theoretical implications: The study shows that collective action is important for smallholder farmers in developing countries to sustainably access markets and increase their marketing performance. Originality/Value: Few studies have examined how social capital and collective action are utilised to improve smallholder farmers marketing performance, particularly in Central Africa.

T1  - Wealth Creation and Distribution along the Emerging Chisumbanje Sugarcane Bio-ethanol Value Chain in Zimbabwe
AN  - 2033756789
AB  - Within the context of large scale investments on agricultural land for biofuels, this paper analyses the creation and distribution of value added and gross margins along the emerging Chisumbanje sugarcane bio-ethanol value chain in Zimbabwe. Using empirical data collected using different approaches, the study customised inputoutput modelling and multiple gross margin analysis to analyse wealth creation and distribution along this chain. The evidence shows that income distribution is skewed towards vertically integrated large corporates and this value chain in general is not inclusive of smallholder farmers. The private investor is getting more than seventy-three percent of the income that is generated along the whole chain while the rest is shared among the settler farmers, war veterans and the government agency. The pricing of US$4 per tonne makes primary production of sugarcane a loss-making enterprise, systematically this incentivising any potential entrants into primary sugarcane production. The emerging sugarcane bio-ethanol value chain is not inclusive.

AB  - PurposeThe decision by the Government of Kenya in 2013 to increase tax revenue by imposing excise duty of 50 percent on sorghum beer resulted in economic losses for smallholders, the brewery, and the government itself because it effectively killed the value chain. In 2015, the government reversed the policy decision and reduced excise duty to 10 percent. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of this policy decision on the value chain, adaptation by growers and the brewery, and the rationale for this policy change and its reversal.Design/methodology/approachThe author analyzes this episode using a conceptual framework derived from complex adaptive systems, focusing on four properties of such systems: sudden, endogenous shocks, interacting agents, and adaptation.FindingsThe author shows how the nature of politics in Kenya exposed the value chain to endogenous shocks as the result of conflicts between interacting agents, where smallholder farmer organizations were important for successful adaptation. Conflicts between development and political objectives in neo-patrimonial states are sources of complexity and uncertainty in smallholder value chains.Research limitations/implicationsComplex adaptive systems proved a useful framework to understand decision making by government and business actors in the value chain.Originality/valueThe paper applies a novel conceptual framework to the analysis of an important value chain in Kenya.

T1  - Ambition meets reality: lessons from the taro boom in Nicaragua
AN  - 2007935448
AB  - PurposeBetween 2006 and 2011, Nicaragua shipped an average of US$9.4 million per year of smallholder-produced fresh taro (Colocasia esculenta) to the USA; however, by 2016, the US market for Nicaraguan taro had effectively collapsed. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the short-lived taro boom from the perspective of complex adaptive systems, showing how shocks, interactions between value chain actors, and lack of adaptive capacity among chain actors together contributed to the collapse of the chain.Design/methodology/approachPrimary data were collected from businesses and smallholders in 2010 and 2016 to understand the actors involved, their business relations, and the benefits and setbacks they experienced along the way.FindingsThe results show the capacity of better-off smallholders to engage in a demanding market, but also the struggles faced by more vulnerable smallholders to build new production systems and respond to internal and external shocks. Local businesses were generally unprepared for the uncertainties inherent in fresh horticultural trade or for engagement with distant buyers.Research limitations/implicationsExisting guides and tools for designing value chain interventions will benefit from greater attention to the circumstances of local actors and the challenges of building productive inter-business relations under higher levels of risk and uncertainty.Originality/valueThis case serves as a wake-up call for practitioners, donors, researchers, and the private sector on how to identify market opportunities and the design of more robust strategies to respond to them.

T1  - Classification of elite cassava varieties (<i>Manihot esculenta</i> Crantz) cultivated in Benin Republic using farmers’ knowledge, morphological traits and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers
AN  - 1993415501
AB  - Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important food security crop or resource for poor rural communities particularly in Africa. The crop’s ability to produce high yields even under poor conditions and storability of its roots underground for longer periods or until needed makes it a model ‘food security crop’. In Benin Republic, cassava has been recognized as one of the major crop contributing towards dynamic value chains generating incomes for small-holder farmers. The crop is grown all over the country, however, the increased production are mainly recorded from far south and central parts of the country. Genetic improvement of cassava in Benin Republic is limited because of poor knowledge of genetic diversity present within the country. The main objective of this study was to assess the genetic diversity and relationships among elite cassava varieties collected from different regions of Benin using fluorescently labelled simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and to compare the results with farmer’s knowledge and morphological traits. A total of 96 cultivars collected from major cassava growing areas such as Southern and Central Benin were classified into 24 different groups using farmers’ knowledge, while classification based on 18 morphological traits resulted in five groups. In total, sixteen SSR markers were tested for molecular analysis of the ninety-six cassava varieties. Among the sixteen, twelve SSR markers gave good banding pattern and were used to genotype the varieties. An average of 3.58 and 0.47 for number of alleles and polymorphism information content respectively was observed. The observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0.23 to 1.0 with an average of 0.66 indicating moderate level of diversity among the cultivars. Based on the proportion of shared alleles and hierarchical clustering, the 96 elite cassava varieties were classified as 74 unique varieties. Principal component analysis and analysis of molecular variance revealed no significant variation between the regions thus, explaining regular exchange of planting materials among cassava farmers across various regions. The moderate level of genetic diversity in famer’s field, revealed in the present study, is a good indication of the need for broadening the genetic base of cassava in Benin Republic and establishing a formal breeding program in the country.

AN  - 1977751954
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine the efficiency of vegetable farmers within the tree-crop based rainforest agro-ecological zone in Southwest region of Cameroon.Design/methodology/approachThe non-parametric data envelopment analysis method was used to evaluate technical and scale efficiencies while the Tobit model was used to identify factors affecting efficiency of vegetable production.FindingsAn econometric analysis result indicates that family size, education and extension service have significant impact on both technical and scale efficiencies, whereas credit service has significant impact on scale efficiency.Practical implicationsFuture agricultural policies could include measures to improve the capacity of farmers to efficiently use existing resources.Social implicationsThe study highlighted that encouraging more people to engage in farm labor and facilitating smallholder access to microcredit could render vegetable farmers more efficient.Originality/valueIn Cameroon, only a few studies have been conducted on technical efficiency. These encompass mainly cash and food crops. To the best of our knowledge, no single study has measured technical efficiency of vegetable farmers in forest-based farming of Cameroon.

T1  - Women's empowerment in traditional food value chains at the micro-level: Evidence from cassava smallholder farming in Tanzania
AN  - 1969032313
AB  - Empowering women improves household food productivity and security. We examined women's empowerment within the cassava value chain according to the five domains of empowerment of the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index, using data from 228 respondents in Tanzania. Disempowerment indices for women and men were 0.95 and 0.14, respectively. Women were disempowered in the production, leadership, and time domains. Women were empowered in the resources domain, which entailed joint ownership and decision making. Marital status and educational levels were significantly associated with women's empowerment. Policies to improve women's empowerment should focus on securing ownership of resources and access to credit.

T1  - Approaches and tools for inclusive value chain development: lessons from Uganda for improved impact
AN  - 2055207141
AB  - Value chain development (VCD) with smallholders forms a central element of the poverty reduction strategies of governments and NGOs in developing countries. Nevertheless, too little is known about how VCD interventions are designed and implemented, the approaches and tools used, and the challenges faced in the process. This paper helps to fill this gap with evidence from six cases in Uganda. For each case, data was collected from interviews with NGOs, government organizations, buyers, and smallholder business organizations. Results indicate that use of available VCD guides and tools facilitated productive partnerships among chain actors, engagement with support organizations, and feedback mechanisms on intervention processes. Results also challenge NGOs, government agencies, and researchers to better understand the circumstances of resource-poor chain actors, the implications of VCD on gender relations, and the cultural and business context when designing and implementing VCD. This calls for stakeholders to employ a broader approach to VCD, using a combination of available and new tools, and to seek out deeper collaboration with key actors within and outside the value chain.

T1  - Harnessing local strength for sustainable coffee value chains in India and Nicaragua: reevaluating certification to global sustainability standards
AN  - 2051053431
AB  - Coffee is generally grown in areas derived from forest, and both its expansion and management cause biodiversity loss. Sustainability standards in coffee are well established but have been criticized while social and environmental impact is elusive. This paper assesses the issue-attention cycle of coffee production in India and Nicaragua, including producer concerns and responses over time to concerns (sustainability standards, public regulations and development projects). Systematic comparison of the socioeconomic, environmental and policy context in both countries is then used to explore potential effects of sustainability standards. Results show limits, in local context, to relevance of global certification approaches: in both countries due to naturally high levels of biodiversity within coffee production systems global standards are easily met. They do not provide recognition for the swing potential (difference between best and worst) and do not raise the bar of environmental outcomes though nationally biodiversity declines. Nicaraguan regulations have focused on the socioeconomic development of the coffee sector via strengthening producer organizations, while India prioritized environmental and biodiversity conservation. In India, externally driven sustainability standards partially replace the existing producer-buyer relationship while in Nicaragua standards are desired by producer organizations. The temporal comparison shows that recently local stakeholders harness improvements through their unique local value propositions: the 'small producer' symbol in Nicaragua and certification of geographic origin in India. Nicaragua builds on the strength of its smallholder sector while India builds on its strength of being home to a global biodiversity hotspot.EDITED BY Beria Leimona

T1  - Unpacking 'sustainable' cocoa: do sustainability standards, development projects and policies address producer concerns in Indonesia, Cameroon and Peru?
AN  - 2051052213
AB  - 'Sustainable cocoa' has attracted considerable attention. However, stakeholders in cocoa development may differ in their understanding of sustainable cocoa, their interests and actions taken in advancing sustainable cocoa. This article analyses cocoa sustainability at nested scales and analyses to what extent sustainability standards, policies and development projects address sustainability concerns and contribute to ecosystem services. The analysis is based on literature reviews and key informant interviews in Sulawesi (Indonesia), Ucayali (Peru) and Centre Region (Cameroon). Producers in all three countries shared concerns of price volatility, weak farmer organizations and dependence on few buyers. Producers in Sulawesi and Centre Region compensated low returns to cocoa production by diversification of cocoa systems. Public and private development actors were concerned with low production volumes. Research has so far focused on biodiversity loss, which differed depending on the cocoa sector's age in a country. Policies and development programs in all countries have focused on cocoa sector expansion and productivity increases, irrespective of smallholder needs for economically viable farming systems and existing market structures resulting in little bargaining power to farmers. Sustainability standards have spread unevenly and have converged in compliance criteria over time, although initially differing in focus. Recently added business and development criteria of sustainability standards can potentially address farmers' concerns. Competing interests and interdependencies between different actors' responses to concerns have so far not been openly acknowledged by public and private sector actors.EDITED BY Beria Leimona

T1  - Unpacking Indonesia’s independent oil palm smallholders: An actor-disaggregated approach to identifying environmental and social performance challenges
AN  - 1975983842
AB  - Processes of globalization have generated new opportunities for smallholders to participate in profitable global agro-commodity markets. This participation however is increasingly being shaped by differentiated capabilities to comply with emerging public and private quality and safety standards. The dynamics within Indonesia's oil palm sector illustrate well the types of competitive challenges smallholders face in their integration into global agro-commodity chains. Because of public concern over the poor social and environmental performance of the sector, many governments, companies and consumers are attempting to clean up the value chain through self-regulatory commitments, certification and public regulation. As a result, many of Indonesia's oil palm smallholders face compliance barriers due to informality and poor production practices, and threaten to become alienated from formal markets, which could in turn lead to a bifurcation of the oil palm sector. Recognizing that many oil palm smallholders lack compliance capacity, myriad public and private actors have begun designing initiatives to address compliance barriers and enhance smallholder competitiveness. However, failure to properly account for the heterogeneity of the smallholder oil palm sector will undermine the effectiveness and scalability of such initiatives. By developing a typology of independent smallholder oil palm farmers in Rokan Hulu district, Riau province, this article reveals the wide diversity of actors that compose Indonesia's smallholder oil palm economy, the types of compliance barriers they face and the sustainable development challenges they pose. In doing so, this article illustrates how global agro-commodity chains can drive agrarian differentiation and offer new insights into the complex dynamics of agricultural frontier expansion.

T1  - Small Farms Survival and Growth: Making Investments Despite Credit Constraints
AN  - 1967379464
AB  - This article argues that we know little about how small farmers in post-communist Europe survive and even grow while having little access to credit markets. In approaching small farmers, this paper builds on ideas of self-provisioning, contending that the tendency among small farmers is not one of growth towards and through economies of scale, but one of internalising and de-monetising costs, by growing in order to control upstream and downstream links in the value chain. It asks what is it that makes self-provisioning possible in two post-communist regions (located in Romania and Ukraine) and identifies various assets in the smallholders' environments, such as most importantly a diverse scene of intermediaries supplying smallholders with cash incomes. The implication of the research is that the existence of these assets is crucial for the smallholders' survival and growth, and these assets should be valued accordingly rather than dismissed in favour of integrating smallholders into modern, retailer-dominated, value chains.

T1  - The Character of Emerging Biofuel Value Chains: Focus on the Chisumbanje Sugarcane Bio-ethanol Chain in Zimbabwe
AN  - 2032463828
AB  - The investments in large scale sugarcane production for processing into ethanol fuel that have occurred in Zimbabwe have generated debate in the media and the public in general. This paper characterises the typology and key elements of the emerging Chisumbanje sugarcane bio-ethanol value chain using empirical data on supply utilisation accounts (SUA) and value chain governance. It is concluded that the value chain is characterised by the pervasiveness of monopolistic tendencies and dominance of powerful private corporates being supported by government. Legislative changes and involvement of powerful Government and political institutions has created strong opportunities for rent seeking as the investor lobbies powerful players in pursuance of high private economic benefits. The value chain systematically excludes the smallholder farming community from directly participating in the productive aspects of the chain. Production systems have changed for the local communities that have been displaced and there are indications of losses of traditional livelihood sources.

T1  - Investigating factors responsible for farmers' abandonment of Jatropha curcas L. as bioenergy crop under smallholder out-grower schemes in Chibombo District, Zambia
AN  - 1985904567
AB  - The early 2000s witnessed a global awareness on adoption of renewable and environmentally friendly energy with anticipated socio-economic benefits in developing countries. Jatropha curcas. L. (Jatropha) was the main bioenergy crop adopted for production under out-grower schemes in Zambia. However, recent studies report worldwide abandonment of Jatropha production. This study therefore investigated factors responsible for the abandonment of Jatropha production under out-grower schemes in Chibombo District, Zambia. A total of 110 smallholder farmers who participated in these out-grower schemes and one key informant were selected using snowball sampling. Primary data was collected using field observations and a cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire administered through face-to-face interviews. Findings reveal that abandonment of Jatropha production was mainly driven by lack of market for the produce, and non-commitment of the sponsoring firm to contractual agreements under the out-grower schemes. Thus, more than 90% of the farmers did not earn income from the sale of Jatropha. To achieve optimal performance of these out-grower schemes, a supporting policy environment and legal framework enforcing compliance to contractual agreements are required. Further, such should be accompanied by creation of market opportunities for the crop as well as its price regulation.

T1  - Value Chain Upgrading and the Inclusion of Smallholders in Markets: Reflections on Contributions of Multi-Stakeholder Processes in Dairy Development in Tanzania
AN  - 1966281267
AB  - Increasingly, value chain approaches are integrated with multi-stakeholder processes to facilitate inclusive innovation and value chain upgrading of smallholders. This pathway to smallholder integration into agri-food markets has received limited analysis. This article analyses this integration through a case study of an ongoing smallholder dairy development programme in Tanzania. Value chain upgrading and innovation systems perspectives were combined in an analytical framework to interpret the findings, which show that multi-stakeholder processes enhance horizontal and vertical coordination but limit process and product upgrading. The main conclusion is that, although such processes may catalyze smallholder market inclusion, their effects are largely bounded by existing value chain structures (e.g. production system, fragmented markets), timeframe and how prevailing institutional constraints are addressed, which may constrain the intentions of such collaboration action. This calls attention to the starting points of value chain interventions and the socio-political dynamics that are part of multi-stakeholder processes.Alternate abstract:De plus en plus, on intègre l’approche de la chaîne de valeur à celle de l’étude des processus de diverses parties prenantes, afin de faciliter l’innovation inclusive et l’amélioration de la chaîne de valeur des petits cultivateurs. Le trajet d’intégration des petits agriculteurs aux marchés agroalimentaires n’a pas été très analysé. Cet article examine cette intégration à travers une étude de cas, celui d’une petite exploitation agricole et laitière, faisant partie d’un programme de développement en Tanzanie. Au sein d’un cadre analytique d’interprétation des résultats, on a intégré les perspectives d’amélioration de la chaîne de valeur et des systèmes d’innovation. On a vu que les processus impliquant divers parties prenantes renforcent la coordination horizontale et verticale, mais au même temps ils limitent la valorisation des produits et des procès. La conclusion principale est que même si ces processus servent de catalyseurs a l’intégration des petits cultivateurs au marché, leurs effets sont délimites par la structure existante de la chaîne de valeur (par exemple, le système de production, la fragmentation des marchés), par la période considéré, et par comment les contraintes institutionnelles sont abordés, puisqu’elles peuvent limiter les intentions de ces actions collaboratives. D’ici on veut porter l’attention sur le point de départ des interventions sur les chaînes de valeur, et aussi sur les dynamiques socio-politiques qui font partie des processus avec diverses parties prenantes.

T1  - Connecting smallholder farmers to local markets: Drivers of collective action, land tenure and food security in East Chad
AN  - 1966077450
AB  - The paper deals with the drivers influencing smallholder farmers' access to local markets in developing countries, assuming that collective actions along with food security and land tenure are related and interconnected aspects that could facilitate market access. Data were collected in 26 Chadian villages in the Sila region; 98 questionnaires were submitted to peanut and sesame farmers belonging to associations. An ordered logistic regression was adopted to estimate our model where the dependent variable, access to market, is operationalized in terms of perceived improvement to market access. Our research contributes to the present understanding of the determinants of market access and its links with collective actions, land and food security through a comprehensive view of association support activities, structural features and household assets. Our main findings highlight that the role of secure land tenure is crucial in order to achieve a better access to local markets, confirming that strong relationships within local value chain stakeholders have positive effects on the capability to sell products, whereas the role of food security is circular: the more food secure a farmer is, the more he or she has access to markets but on the other side access to markets guarantees a higher food security.

T1  - Costs, revenues and profits: an economic analysis of smallholder tobacco farmer livelihoods in Malawi
AN  - 1954885384
AB  - Background 
The preservation of the economic livelihood of tobacco farmers is a common argument used to oppose tobacco control measures. However, little empirical evidence exists about these livelihoods. We seek to evaluate the economic livelihoods of individual tobacco farmers in Malawi, including how much money they earn from selling tobacco, and the costs they incur to produce the crop, including labour inputs. We also evaluate farmers' decisions to contract directly with firms that buy their crops. 
Methods 
We designed and implemented an economic survey of 685 tobacco farmers, including both independent and contract farmers, across the 6 main tobacco-growing districts. We augmented the survey with focus group discussions with subsets of respondents from each region to refine our inquiries. 
Results 
Contract farmers cultivating tobacco in Malawi as their main economic livelihoods are typically operating at margins that place their households well below national poverty thresholds, while independent farmers are typically operating at a loss. Even when labour is excluded from the calculation of income less costs, farmers' gross margins place most households in the bottom income decile of the overall population. Tobacco farmers appear to contract principally as a means to obtain credit, which is consistently reported to be difficult to obtain. 
Conclusions 
The tobacco industry narrative that tobacco farming is a lucrative economic endeavour for smallholder farmers is demonstrably inaccurate in the context of Malawi. From the perspective of these farmers, tobacco farming is an economically challenging livelihood for most.

T1  - Is contract farming an inclusive alternative to land grabbing? The case of potato contract farming in Maharashtra, India
AN  - 1966397856
AB  - In the recent explosion of attention given to the land grabbing phenomenon, contract farming has been identified as a potentially inclusive alternative for smallholders to outright acquisition of farm land by agri-business capital. This paper responds to these claims by resituating contract farming as an equally important form of land control. The focus of the paper is a case study of potato contract farming in Maharashtra, India. While there is 'nothing new' about contract farming as a mode of agriculture production in India, its influence on patterns of agrarian change is poorly understood. Adopting an agrarian political economy-informed livelihoods approach, the paper argues that rather than an inclusive alternative to land grabbing, contract farming in the study site represents another way that capital is coming to control land in rural India, with just as important implications for agrarian livelihoods. While some individual households have improved their livelihoods through participation, the contract scheme acts to reinforce already existing patterns of inequality. In particular, the unequal power relations between firm and farmer skew the capture of benefits towards the firm, and render participating households vulnerable to indebtedness and loss of autonomy over land and livelihood decisions.

T1  - The economic impacts of agricultural cooperatives on smallholder farmers in rural China
AN  - 1949496136
AB  - This paper examines the impacts of agricultural cooperative membership on output price, gross income, farm profit, and return on investment (ROI) utilizing a recent household survey data of 481 apple producers in China. We employ a treatment effects model to account for potential selection bias that arises from the fact that cooperative members and nonmembers are systematically different in terms of both observable and unobservable factors. Our analysis reveals that cooperative membership has a positive and statistically significant impact on apple price, gross income, farm profit, and ROI. In addition, we find that the highest profit effect of cooperative membership does not in fact result in the highest ROI effect of the membership, revealing differences in farm income and profitability of investment.

T1  - Household nutrition and income impacts of using dairy technologies in mixed crop-livestock production systems
AN  - 1945033309
AB  - Technologies like improved breeds of dairy cows and improved forages have the potential to significantly increase dairy cow productivity and farmers' profits in developing countries. However, adoption of such technologies has been low in Ethiopia, despite numerous efforts to disseminate the technologies in the past. Some studies argue that adoption of technologies is low because welfare effects of the technologies could be insignificant or negative to certain groups of farmers. This article employed propensity score matching and inverse probability weighting estimator with regression adjustment to examine the difference in household nutrition and income between adopters and nonadopters of dairy technologies in rural Ethiopia. We find that adoption of cross-bred dairy cows and improved forages increases household nutrition and income. The significant household nutrition and income impact for adopters support the notion that many Ethiopian smallholders have not adopted dairy technologies because adopters and nonadopters of dairy technologies have inherent differences in welfare outcome potentials. The results suggest that interventions that enhance access to farm resources and address barriers to input and output value chains could improve adoption of dairy technologies.

T1  - Agroecology accounting: biodiversity and sustainable livelihoods from the margins
AN  - 1940145103
AB  - Purpose 
The purpose of this paper is to provide a socio-ecological counter account of the role that agroecology plays in supporting the sustainable livelihoods of a co-operative of smallholder coffee farmers, where very little value is created at their end of the coffee commodity chain. Agroecology may be defined as the science that provides the ecological principles and concepts for the design and management of productive agricultural ecosystems that conserve natural resources. 
Design/methodology/approach 
This study uses a case study design of a coffee-producing co-operative in India using data collected from participant observation, focus groups and unstructured interviews with indigenous smallholder farmers. It combines the science of agroecology with the labour theory of value as a theoretical framework. 
Findings 
An agroecological approach supports agricultural biodiversity, while promoting sustainable livelihoods since members of the co-operative are able to reduce their use of external inputs. However, an agroecological transformation is curtailed by the continued dependence on corporate value chains. A framework using the labour theory of value is used to explain the extraction of surplus value from the labour of both the smallholder farmers as well as nature. This study provides evidence of the role of government policy and practice in perpetuating the status quo by not promoting either research on agroecology or direct consumer to producer value chains while providing subsidies for the inputs of industrial agriculture. 
Originality/value 
There have been very few studies that have provided an account of the limited value generated in agricultural commodity chains for smallholder farmers due to the need to purchase the inputs of industrial agriculture supported by government subsidies. This study extends the field of accounting for biodiversity into agriculture using the science of agroecology to explain the role played by biodiversity in increasing the amount of value generated by smallholder farmers. By utilising the labour theory of value, the authors have introduced the notion of the labour power of nature as represented by the environmental services that nature provides.

T1  - Market organization and animal genetic resource management: a revealed preference analysis of sheep pricing
AN  - 1939715601
AB  - Farm animal genetic resources are threatened worldwide. Participation in markets, while representing a crucial way out of poverty for many smallholders, affects genetic management choices with associated sustainability concerns. This paper proposes a contextualized study of the interactions between markets and animal genetic resources management, in the case of sheep markets in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. It focusses on the organization of marketing chains and the valuation of genetic characteristics by value chain actors. Marketing chain characterization was tackled through semi-structured interviews with 25 exporters and 15 butchers, both specialized in sheep. Moreover, revealed preference methods were applied to analyse the impact of animals' attributes on market pricing. Data were collected from 338 transactions during three different periods: Eid al-Adha, Christmas and New Year period, and a neutral period. The neutral period is understood as a period not close to any event likely to influence the demand for sheep. The results show that physical characteristics such as live weight, height at withers and coat colour have a strong influence on the animals' prices. Live weight has also had an increasing marginal impact on price. The different markets (local butcher, feasts, export market, sacrifices) represent distinct demands for genetic characteristics, entailing interesting consequences for animal genetic resource management. Any breeding programme should therefore take this diversity into account to allow this sector to contribute better to a sustainable development of the country.

To prepare for the development of a national action plan for the improvement of bovine genetic resources in Burundi, we aimed at performing genetic characterization of Ankole and Ankole × European crossbred individuals and assessing the effect of European ancestry on milk productivity of cows kept under the mixed crops livestock system. To that end, we genotyped 37 Ankole and 138 crossbred individuals on 42 636 SNPs and combined these genotypes with those from 21 cattle breeds, representative of the bovine genetic diversity. We also measured milk yield not suckled and estimated suckled milk. Given the results, we confirmed the indicine × African taurine admixed origin of the Ankole in Burundi and showed that crossbred individuals present a high proportion of European ancestry (i.e. 57% on average). As the proportion of European ancestry increased, milk yield increased by 0.03 ± 0.01 l/day, at a lower extent than expected. We also observed that breeders were unable to correctly evaluate the European proportion in their livestock. Our results may provide useful information for objective dairy breeding in Burundi. As an example, an ex-situ conservation program of Ankole within the framework of value chains is proposed as an accompanying strategy to improve the sustainability of the crossbreeding program.

T1  - Rural transformation, cereals and youth in Africa: What role for international agricultural research?
AN  - 2033287705
AB  - Young people are increasingly linked to targeted agriculture and food security interventions. In Africa, the argument is that the combination of agricultural value chains, technology and entrepreneurship will unlock a sweet spot for youth employment. This article examines this argument from a rural transformations perspective. A framework is proposed with which to analyse young people’s economic room to manoeuvre in different rural contexts and the differential abilities of young people to exploit associated opportunities. Using cereal agri-food systems as an example, the article identifies two new research areas that address important knowledge gaps: how young rural people in Africa engage with these systems and what pathways they use to become engaged. To address these questions, we propose an analytical framework built around key contextual factors that constrain or enable young people’s economic activity. By pursuing the proposed research agenda, international agricultural research could make important contributions to both agricultural policy debates and development-oriented interventions.

T1  - Value supply chains at the base of the pyramid: studies of past and present textile networks
AN  - 1970545663
AB  - PurposeBillions of entrepreneurs at the Base of the Pyramid (BoP) operate as small-scale producers within multi-tiered supply chain networks. Unfortunately, a majority of these entrepreneurs are simply unable to derive sufficient value from the network and are vulnerable to disasters and poverty. The purpose of this paper is to develop a typology that examines dynamic and triadic power relationships in order to create value chains for BoP producers.Design/methodology/approachThis paper builds upon the available literature and a relevant historical case study to develop a typology. The validity of the typology is ascertained by examining and comparing two current BoP silk weaver communities in India.FindingsThe typology captures essential environmental variables and relates them to mediated and non-mediated forms of power which, in turn, shape the value derived from the supply chain network.Practical implicationsThe typology provides specific recommendations for BoP producers, such as the formation of cooperatives, engaging in political unionization and ensuring that their social networks expand beyond local communities.Originality/valueThe typology brings together structuration theory and power and provides a framework for understanding supply value. This typology is generalizable to dynamic multi-tiered supply chain networks.

AB  - PurposeIn Africa, poverty and food insecurity is pervasive due to intertwined factors including, declining crop yields, land degradation and inadequate policy and institutional support. With ever-increasing populations, climate change effects will be intensified, and a major crisis is inevitable unless measures to sustain land resources are urgently taken. This paper aims to argue that vibrant rural institutions are necessary to ensure food security and environmental protection, consequently contributing to climate change resilience.Design/methodology/approachThe paper demonstrates the role of institutions by evaluating two types of institutions and their impacts the “status quo” and “hybrid” institutions using case studies from the African Highlands Initiative in Uganda and International Forestry Resources and Institutions in Kenya. It further discusses a model that highlights factors affecting smallholder investment in natural resources management and how these can be used to strengthen local institutions in building their resilience against climate change effects.FindingsWeak grassroots institutions characterized by low capacity, failure to exploit collective capital and poor knowledge sharing and access to information, are common barriers to sustainable land management and improved food security.Research limitations/implicationsCase studies from Uganda and IFRI in Kenya barriers in data collection instruments and language.Practical implicationsIn Africa, poverty and food insecurity is pervasive due to intertwined factors including, declining crop yields, land degradation and inadequate policy and institutional support.

T1  - Broiler production in South Africa: Is there space for smallholders in the commercial chicken coup?
AN  - 1948428375
AB  - It is agreed that agriculture provides avenues for impoverished households to produce and trade their way out of poverty. However, this requires market access and value chain integration of small-scale farmers. This paper explores the possibilities for integration of small-scale farmers into the mainstream commercial broiler value chain in South Africa. Production costs of small-scale producers are evaluated within the context of their commercial counterparts, with a case study approach. It revealed that small-scale producers pay more for inputs but also receive a substantial premium for sales of live birds in the informal market. This results in attractive gross margins for small-scale producers. There is, however, a production ceiling, due to demand and production considerations, associated with small-scale broiler production. This ultimately results in a dualistic industry with an informal (live sale) value chain at the one end of the spectrum and a sophisticated large-scale commercial value chain at the other. Given the salient production features and investment requirements associated with large-scale broiler production, organic growth from the small-scale value chain into the commercial value chain seems improbable. The dual nature of this industry should therefore be considered when developing policy geared towards development, poverty alleviation and value chain integration.

T1  - African farmers' market organizations and global value chains: competitiveness versus inclusiveness
AN  - 1939860649
AB  - This conceptual paper discusses the challenges smallholder producer cooperatives in developing countries face while trying to access agricultural global value chains. We assess the problem of competitiveness related to lack of commitment and improper selection. Prioritization of open membership over selection is generally taken for granted in the policy debate on farmers' market organizations (FMOs). We argue that open membership may work in community-driven organizations, however, it becomes a major threat for entrepreneurial FMOs. Inclusion facilitates free riding, which forms a barrier for investments of members. This is one of the major reasons why so many of these organizations are so much resource constrained, i.e. are not able to compete in the market without external support. FMOs should take targeting and selection serious if entrepreneurial activities are intended. Otherwise, they miss the opportunity to create a committed member base willing to invest in a potentially competitive organization.

T1  - Deploying strategic resources: comparing members of farmer cooperatives to non-members in sub-Saharan Africa
AN  - 1939813765
AB  - Primary producers in global value chains, like any other firm, aim for entrepreneurial success through deploying strategic resources, collective action, strategic intent, and a supportive institutional environment. In the current article, we analyze the extent to which members of farmer cooperatives in Ethiopia succeed in deploying strategic resources. We find that non-members utilize resources more efficiently and that the potential for collective action is not realized. The potential for collective action remains unrealized due to the institutional environment. We suggest pathways for further research.

T1  - Global value chains in Africa and development of opportunities by poor landholders
AN  - 1939812738
AB  - In an effort to help address severe levels of poverty, multinational firms are increasingly seeking to include African smallholders in their global value chains (GVCs). Despite efforts of multinationals to provide such opportunities, the number of successful inclusions remains limited. We draw from the entrepreneurship domain to approach this important issue from an opportunity perspective. At the heart of our effort to develop a greater theoretical understanding is the insight that opportunities can both be discovered and created by smallholders. The key implication of this insight is that multinationals will gain more from their efforts to include small landholders in their GVCs if they adapt their value chain systems in ways that also accommodate joint creation of opportunities with smallholders rather than expect that all smallholders adapt to the systems developed by the large global firms for their large suppliers.

T1  - An economic evaluation of SPREAD on Rwanda's rural population
AN  - 2010953973
AB  - Sustainable Partnerships to Enhance Rural Enterprises and Agricultural Development (SPREAD) was a programme to enhance the value chain for commodities in Rwanda including coffee. The implicit concept was that improving the value chain would increase the incomes for smallholders and, hence, reduce the poverty rate. The results indicate that Rwanda coffee prices increased relative to an index price for traded coffee with the implementation of SPREAD. In addition, the results indicate that participation in the coffee market at this time was associated with higher household income and lower rates of poverty.

T1  - Impacts of extension access and cooperative membership on technology adoption and household welfare
AN  - 1962277707
AB  - This paper examines the impacts of access to extension services and cooperative membership on technology adoption, asset ownership and poverty using household-level data from rural Nigeria. Using different matching techniques and endogenous switching regression approach, we find that both extension access and cooperative membership have a positive and statistically significant effect on technology adoption and household welfare. Moreover, we find that both extension access and cooperative membership have heterogeneous impacts. In particular, we find evidence of a positive selection as the average treatment effects of extension access and cooperative membership are higher for farmers with the highest propensity to access extension and cooperative services. The impact of extension services on poverty reduction and of cooperatives on technology adoption is significantly stronger for smallholders with access to formal credit than for those without access. This implies that expanding rural financial markets can maximize the potential positive impacts of extension and cooperative services on farmers' productivity and welfare.

T1  - Collective action in a smallholder oil palm production system in Indonesia: The key to sustainable and inclusive smallholder palm oil?
AN  - 1962258887
AB  - Indonesian smallholder oil palm generally yield much less than corporate plantations. We analysed a smallholder oil palm production system in West Sumatra which outperformed its nucleus estate plantation, consistently producing yields far above the national average for over 25 years. Its institutional setup allowed farmers to combine the advantages of smallholder and plantation agriculture by capitalizing on collective action. Collective action design principles (Ostrom, 1990; Cox, 2010) are used to assess the institutional setup of a smallholder production system. This case study demonstrates that with a strong institutional arrangement, smallholder oil palm farmers can participate in supply chains on advantageous conditions and substantially increase productivity, thereby contributing to both rural development and land sparing.

T1  - Triangle of Linkages among Modernising Markets, Sprayer-traders, and Mango-farming Intensification in Indonesia
AN  - 1961825902
AB  - The domestic mango value chain in Indonesia is transforming rapidly. This article examines the triangle of linkages among farmers' participation in modernising markets, the emerging use of outsourced services by sprayer-traders (STs), and farm technology intensification. The key findings are as follows. First, small farmers-not just larger farmers-participate in modernising markets. However, the participation is by the upper tier of small farmers, defined in non-land asset terms. Second, although both small and larger farmers use STs, the strongest determinant of use of an ST is the interaction between having non-farm employment (thus, demand for substitution for own labour on the farm) and having a medium-sized commercial farm (thus, demand for skilled agronomic services). Farmers in mango cluster areas also tend to use STs. Finally, use of STs and participation in modernising markets spur farming intensification through the use of modern inputs.

T1  - Agriculture and Structural Transformation in Africa: An Overview
AN  - 1948462275
AB  - Agriculture is the mainstay of most African economies and economic performance in these countries is intricately linked to the performance of the agricultural sector. Indeed, in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the majority of the population resides in rural areas and the majority of farmers (up to 80%) are smallholders. However, productivity of these smallholder farmers is low compared to other developing regions, and this has perpetuated poverty in rural Africa. Agriculture has the greatest potential to reduce poverty in rural Africa. This special issue looks at efforts to transform agriculture in rural SSA to not only raise incomes of farmers, but to also foster broader structural transformation of African economies. The focus is on what needs to be done from a policy and practical point of view to kick-start, and in some cases, entrench structural transformation of the agricultural sector, taking cognizance of the need to transform across the value chain. Commitment by African governments, through initiatives such as the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, is a starting point. Over and above this, there is need to better understand why smallholder farmers are reluctant to invest in modern agricultural technologies, including use of modern seeds and fertilisers. Further, there are several constraints to be overcome for structural transformation of African agriculture to be a reality. These include: investing in development and diffusion of new and appropriate agricultural technologies; investing in infrastructure, including irrigation; addressing post-harvest challenges that small holder farmers face, etc. To better entrench the impacts, structural transformation in agriculture should happen concurrently with structural transformation of the rest of the economy, thus allowing for better allocation of scarce resources throughout the economy.

T1  - Assessing the sustainable development and intensification potential of beef cattle production in Sumbawa, Indonesia, using a system dynamics approach
AN  - 1930441960
AB  - The intensification of beef cattle production in dryland areas of East Indonesia has the potential to substantially raise the incomes of smallholder farmers that dominate the sector. In this study we assess the potential for intensifying beef production on Sumbawa Island, by introducing a household feedlot production system (2–20 animals) based on the Leucaena leucocephala (leucanea) tree legume as an improved source of feed. We used a system dynamics approach to model the entire value chain, accounting for herd dynamics, demand dynamics and seasonality. Our findings complement the growing body of biophysical evidence about the potential success of this intervention, by simulating improvements in the annual profitability for beef farmers in the project area of up to 415% by 2023. Increases in farm profit were shown to depend near equally on the higher productivity of the leucaena feeding system and an associated price premium, demonstrating the importance of supporting improved agricultural production with better marketing practices. The intervention was also shown to generate positive or neutral benefits for the main post-farm value chain actors. Importantly, it also reduced the GHG emission intensity of outputs from the beef herd by 16% by 2020. We explored number of scale-out pathways, including a relatively moderate pace of autonomous adoption for our main analysis, resulting in the accumulation of 3,444 hectares of leucaena 20-years after the initial project phase, which could sustain the fattening of 37,124 male cattle per year. More ambitious rates of scale-out were found to be possible without exceeding the animal and land resources of the island.

T1  - Linkages and Trust in the Value Chain for Small-scale Aquaculture in Asia
AN  - 1925084053
AB  - The small-scale aquaculture (SSA) sector is recognized as making an important contribution to food security, poverty alleviation, and socioeconomic development. A value chain analysis can uncover insights into the linkages and trust within a value chain and constraints and challenges that face the sector. This paper examines the linkages and trust between SSA producers and traders in Asia in order to better understand the constraints and opportunities faced by small-scale producers. The perspective revealed by the value chain analysis provides response strategies that can enhance the sustainability and competitiveness of the entire value chain and the actors that comprise it.

AB  - Recent scholarship on land grabs has begun exploring the complexity of local dynamics of land control, with emphasis on the concepts of access and exclusion and the social processes that influence these two. In this paper, I emphasize that a nuanced examination of broader social-ecological transformations would enrich our understanding of land control and exclusion. Drawing from field research in the Philippine province of Palawan, this paper examines how the combined effects of the practices of conservation enclosures, the uneven land accumulation brought about by oil palm expansion, and the use of legitimizing upland discourses all contribute to social-ecological transformations in swidden and the exclusion of indigenous smallholders from benefiting from integral forms of swidden agriculture. These practices of land control and the associated social-ecological transformations are not just interconnected, but also characterized by feedback mechanisms. The more smallholders decide to alter (or abandon) swidden practices, participate in oil palm contract farming, and/or sell their land to oil palm growers, the greater the tendency for land to accumulate among migrant settlers and absentee landowners. This, in turn, may lead to further reduction in the availability of fallow land and exclusion of more indigenous smallholders over time.

T1  - Sugar-Cane and Oil Palm Expansion in Guatemala and its Consequences for the Regional Economy
AN  - 1909564328
AB  - Corporate-owned sugar-cane and oil palm plantations in Guatemala are expanding at the expense of smallholder agriculture. Land control grabs are not only having consequences for local communities and ecosystems, but also for regional economies. The present study compares the value chains of smallholder products with those of sugar and palm oil. Primary data were collected from agricultural producers and their backward and forward sectors in the agricultural regions where the plantations are most prominent. The results show that on a regional level, sugar and palm oil generate fewer jobs in comparison to the products of small-scale agriculture, which have important forward linkages to small and medium trading and processing sectors. In addition, the wealth created by small-scale farming remains within the regions, whereas profits from the sugar and palm oil industries are being transferred out of them. Therefore, to achieve inclusive regional development, smallholder agriculture should be strengthened rather than promoting monoculture expansion.

T1  - Preparation of value added composite boards using finished leather waste and plant fibers--a waste utilization effort in Ethiopia
AN  - 1905384889
AB  - Preparation of composite materials with better mechanical properties and agreeable use is a need of the time for the reason that it is eco-friendly. Having this objective in mind, the work of preparing value-added leather composites using finished leather waste and various plant fibers as raw materials is done in the laboratory of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Central Leather Research Institute, India. In the leather goods and footwear manufacturing industries, about 20-30% of leather is discarded as waste, and presently it is imperative to make effort to utilize this waste in Ethiopia because it is huge and untapped resource. The recycled leather (RCL) as control and its composite boards (CBs) which are the mixtures of leather fibers with plant fibers like jute (Corchorus trilocularis L.), hibiscus (Hibiscus cannabinus), sisal (Agave sisalana), palm (Phoenix dactylifera) and enset (Ensete ventricosum) in the proportion of 10, 20, 30, and 40% are characterized for their physicochemical properties (tensile strength, elongation at break, stitch tear strength, water absorption, water desorption, and flexing strength), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). Composites exhibited better mechanical properties compared to those of control boards. SEM pictures showed the composite nature of the boards. TGA studies revealed better thermal stability for composites. In the DSC study, the CBs of RCL-S and RCL-P exhibited higher melting point values than those of RCL-J, RCL-H, and RCL-E samples. Based on these results, all the composite boards may be used as raw material for the preparation of consumer products such as insoles, chapel-uppers, wallets, light hand bags, mouse pads, roofing, wall partitioning, and components of furniture and interior decorations.

T1  - Beyond sustainability criteria and principles in palm oil production: addressing consumer concerns through insetting
AN  - 1943097933
AB  - Palm oil is one of the most controversial agricultural commodities of our time. To its supporters, it is the golden crop that catalyzes smallholders out of poverty and brings salvation to the global food and energy crisis. For its critics, it is the single biggest threat driving the wholesale destruction of peatlands and rainforests as well as adding to greenhouse gas emissions. Hailed as a turning point in 2004, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) has been widely criticized as being unable to change the industry fast enough. We argue that certification, although certainly important, will not be able to deliver expected environmental and social benefits because of (1) an uneven distribution of incentives along the value chain, (2) traceability issues, (3) difficulties associated with an expanding market, and (4) alternative low standard markets to the standard large Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) markets. We argue that the sustainability debate has actually failed to address the fact that oil palm landscape as a whole would be more sustainable if smallholders for whom palm oil is not an economic viable avenue would engage in other forms of land use. An important starting point for change is to move beyond narrow business interests of satisfying customers and shareholders interests only and tackle the implicit contract between palm oil marketers and importers and the smallholder agricultural communities in palm oil producing areas. We introduce the concept of livelihood “insetting” that goes beyond the pure sustainability aspect by also addressing the issue of mutuality along the global value chain.

T1  - Size isn't everything: narratives of scale and viability in a Tanzanian irrigation scheme
AN  - 1898588500
AB  - This paper explores tensions over scale and viability in irrigated agricultural development in Tanzania. A revival of ambition to transform African agriculture has reawakened debate over what type of agriculture can best deliver increased production and poverty reduction for rural populations. This paper examines these debates through the lens of an ethnographic study of an irrigated rice farm in Tanzania. With a chequered history of state and donor intervention management, Dakawa, Rice Farm in Mvomero District is now collectively farmed by a cooperative society of 'small farmers'. It is widely hailed as a success, both of irrigation production, and of 'small farmers' in delivering this. However, such narratives of smallness and success obscure a more complex reality in which smallness of scale may be more of a discursive tool than a reflection of empirical reality. Although notions of 'viability' and 'success' in such development interventions are themselves also contested and depend on perspective, there is evidence that there are fundamental problems of both short- and long-term viability.

T1  - The triple burden: the impact of time poverty on women's participation in coffee producer organizational governance in Mexico
AN  - 1891693177
AB  - In the mid-1990s, fairtrade-organic registration data showed that only 9 % of Oaxaca, Mexico's organic coffee 'farm operators' were women; by 2013 the female farmer rate had increased to 42 %. Our research investigates the impact of this significant increase in women's coffee association participation among 210 members of two coffee producer associations in Oaxaca, Mexico. We find that female coffee organization members report high levels of household decision-making power and they are more likely than their male counterparts to report control over their coffee income. These significant advances in women's agency within the household are offset by the fact that the women experience significant time poverty as they engage in coffee production while bearing a disproportionate share of domestic labor obligations. The women coffee producers view organizational labor as a third burden on their time, after their reproductive and productive labor. The time poverty they experience limits their ability to fully participate in coffee organizational governance and consequently there are few women leaders at all levels of the coffee producer businesses. This is problematic because it limits women's ability to fully benefit from organizational membership: when women fully participate in governance they gain valuable business and leadership skills and producer associations with active female members may also be more likely to develop and maintain programs and policies that enhance gender equity. Our findings indicate that targeted agricultural development programs to improve gender equity among agricultural smallholders should involve creative ways to ease women's labor burdens and reduce their time poverty in order to facilitate full organizational participation. The research findings fill a gap in existing studies of agricultural global value chains (GVCs) by demonstrating how the certified coffee GVC depends on women's under and un-paid labor not only within the household but also within producer organizations.

T1  - Conservation agriculture and gendered livelihoods in Northwestern Cambodia: decision-making, space and access
AN  - 1891693106
AB  - Smallholder farmers in Rattanakmondol District, Battambang Province, Cambodia face challenges related to soil erosion, declining yields, climate change, and unsustainable tillage-based farming practices in their efforts to increase food production within maize-based systems. In 2010, research for development programs began introducing agricultural production systems based on conservation agriculture (CA) to smallholder farmers located in four communities within Rattanakmondol District as a pathway for addressing these issues. Understanding gendered practices and perspectives is integral to adapting CA technologies to the needs of local communities. This research identifies how gender differences regarding farmers' access to assets, practices, and engagement in intra-household negotiations could constrain or facilitate the dissemination of CA. Our mixed-methods approach includes focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews, farmer field visits, and a household survey. Gender differences in access to key productive assets may affect men's and women's individual ability to adapt CA. Farmers perceive the practices and technologies of CA as labor-saving, with the potential to reduce men's and women's labor burden in land-preparation activities. However, when considered in relation to the full array of productive and reproductive livelihood activities, CA can disproportionately affect men's and women's labor. Decisions about agricultural livelihoods were not always made jointly, with socio-cultural norms and responsibilities structuring an individual's ability to participate in intra-household negotiations. While gender differences in power relations affect intra-household decision-making, men and women household members collectively negotiate the transition to CA-based production systems.

T1  - Risk Factors for African Swine Fever in Smallholder Pig Production Systems in Uganda
AN  - 1891691465
AB  - Summary              Smallholder pig production in Uganda is constrained by poor management and high disease burden, with African swine fever (ASF) being one of the most important contributors. However, data to develop appropriate evidence-based disease mitigating interventions along the pig value chain are lacking. This study aimed at determining risk factors associated with the occurrence of outbreaks of ASF in selected districts. A cross-sectional survey of 1195 pig-keeping households in three districts was carried out between April and July 2013. Households were classified into one of three value chain domains (VCDs) based on where the production was located and where most of the products were sold: rural-rural (R-R), rural-urban (R-U) and urban-urban (U-U). Findings revealed that crop farming is the most common primary activity in the R-R and R-U VCDs, while pig keeping was the most common primary activity in the U-U VCDs. Pigs are mostly kept tethered or left to roam in the R-R and R-U VCDs, while in the U-U VCDs, they are mostly confined in corrals. Nearly 20% of the farmers whose farms were hit by an ASF outbreak subsequently sold all their pigs (healthy and sick) to the market in panic. Factors that positively correlated with recent ASF outbreaks were prompt disposal of dead pigs on farms (P < 0.001, OR = 2.3), wild animals present in the village (P < 0.001, OR = 1.7) and farmers sourcing drugs from stockists (P < 0.001, OR = 1.6); while protective factors were the presence of perimeter fences (P = 0.03, OR = 0.5), attendance of farmers at secondary-school level and above (P < 0.001, OR = 0.6), routine cleaning of the pig pens (P < 0.001, OR = 0.6) and pigs being the only livestock kept by farmer (P = 0.01, OR = 0.7). Given the current situation, there is a need to raise awareness among farmers and other value chain actors of biosecurity measures and create incentives for farmers to report ASF cases.

T1  - Outgrowers and Livelihoods: The Case of Magobbo Smallholder Block Farming in Mazabuka District in Zambia
AN  - 1889751076
AB  - Outgrower schemes are increasingly seen as a way to empower smallholders economically, while addressing their production constraints. This article examines an outgrower sugar cane scheme in Zambia officially launched in 2008 with substantial grant funding from the European Union. In this case, the outgrowers are not involved in the production, but pass their land in a block to be managed by a company. This acts as an extension of the nucleus estate, with dividends paid according to a collective contract. The scheme, and associated grant funding, has proved highly beneficial for Zambia Sugar Plc, owned by South African multinational Illovo Sugar (which became wholly owned by Associated British Foods in June 2016). The new outgrowers are increasingly differentiated: some are former dryland farmers, whereas others are outsiders from nearby towns. Some have benefited significantly, with opportunities for accumulation. Others have not, as dividends have been shared by an increasing number of family members. Intra-household distribution of sugar income has exposed gender differences, as it is mostly men who are the designated shareholders. Moreover, the new wealth flowing from the scheme has provoked political contestation within the community, as some seek to exert control over the scheme. Thus, the sugar block scheme has radically changed agrarian relations in the area. There are higher incomes for some - and a seeming success of the outgrower model - but this comes at a cost, as land, livelihoods and social relations are reconfigured.

T1  - An innovation platform for institutional change in Ghana's cocoa sector
AN  - 2428028256
AB  - Cocoa is a major source of employment, smallholder farmers' incomes, and export revenue in Ghana. However, by 2010 institutional constraints throughout the value chain were failing to sustain bean quality and cocoa production. A national-level innovation platform, comprising key public and private actors in the cocoa sector, was established in 2010 to analyse and act to address this concern. The members' initial inquiries revealed that: farmers indirectly were paying for the national mass spraying and Hi-Tech input programmes, both provided free at the point of delivery. As the largest components in the cost structure, these programmes to a large extent accounted for the low price paid to farmers for their beans; a volatile exchange rate regime meant that often the prevailing rate was not equal to its equilibrium level; policies that heavily taxed cocoa were destroying farmers' expectation of long-term profitability. This paper draws on data recorded from the beginning 2009 to end 2013 by means of theory-guided process tracing (TGPT), to show how the platform contributed to increased prices for farmers, to subsequent reform of the input supply arrangements, and to changes to the mass spraying programme. The key causal mechanisms identified are policy learning and progressive amendment of existing institutions. The paper concludes by drawing lessons for the role of an innovation platform.Alternate abstract:
Au Ghana, le cacao est une source importante d'emplois, de revenus pour les petits agriculteurs et de recettes d'exportation. Cependant, en 2010, il a été diagnostiqué que des contraintes tout au long de la filière avaient un impact négatif sur la qualité et la production de fèves de cacao. Une plate-forme d'innovation nationale, comprenant les principaux acteurs publics et privés de la filière cacao, a donc été mise en place en 2010 pour analyser le problème et y répondre. Les enquêtes initiales ont révélé : que les agriculteurs payaient indirectement pour les programmes nationaux de « pulvérisation de pesticides » et d'intrants « Hi-Tech », tous deux soi-disant disponibles gratuitement ; or, en tant que composantes les plus importantes dans la structure des coûts, ces programmes étaient en fait largement responsables du faible prix payé aux agriculteurs pour leurs fèves ; qu'un régime de taux de change très fluctuant faisait que le taux en vigueur était rarement à son point d'équilibre ; que les politiques agricoles taxant lourdement le cacao réduisaient les espérances de rentabilité à long terme des agriculteurs. Le présent article utilise des données recueillies de début 2009 à fin 2013 pour montrer comment la plate-forme d'innovation a pu contribuer à une augmentation des prix payés aux agriculteurs, à la modification des contrats d'approvisionnement en intrants et à la réforme du programme de pulvérisation de pesticides. Les principaux mécanismes explicatifs identifiés sont l'apprentissage politique et l'évolution progressive des institutions en place. L'article en tire des conclusions sur le rôle possible d'une plate-forme d'innovation.

T1  - Leveling the field for biofuels: comparing the economic and environmental impacts of biofuel and other export crops in Malawi
AN  - 1896668035
AB  - Biofuels often raise the specter of food insecurity, water resource depletion, and greenhouse gas emissions from land clearing. These concerns underpin the "sustainability criteria" governing access to European biofuel markets. However, it is unclear if producing biofuels in low-income countries does exacerbate poverty and food insecurity, and moreover, whether the sustainability criteria should apply to all agricultural exports entering European markets. We develop an integrated modeling framework to simultaneously assess the economic and environmental impacts of producing biofuels in Malawi. We incorporate the effects of land use change on crop water use, and the opportunity costs of using scarce resources for biofuels instead of other crops. We find that biofuel production reduces poverty and food insecurity by raising household incomes. Irrigated outgrower schemes, rather than estate farms, lead to better economic outcomes, fewer emissions, and similar water requirements. Nevertheless, to gain access to European markets, Malawi would need to reduce emissions from ethanol plants. We find that biofuels' economic and emissions outcomes are generally preferable to tobacco or soybeans. We conclude that the sustainability criteria encourage more sustainable biofuel production in countries like Malawi, but are perhaps overly biased against biofuels since other export crops raise similar concerns about food security and environmental impacts.

T1  - Vulnerability to Cumulative Hazards: Coping with the Coffee Leaf Rust Outbreak, Drought, and Food Insecurity in Nicaragua
AN  - 1895829613
AB  - Recurrent food insecurity in the highlands of Central America has been exacerbated by the recent convergence of a coffee leaf rust outbreak that began defoliating crops in 2011 and a drought that started in 2014. In the context of these multiple challenges, this paper explores how seasonal hunger is related to smallholder organizational affiliation, farm and farmer characteristics, and post-hazard household-level coping strategies. The study integrates qualitative research, hydro-climatic data analysis, and a survey' of 368 households completed in 2014. A number of household capacities correlate significantly with shorter periods of seasonal hunger: households with larger farms, with off-farm employment, and that produce more than half of their food, maintain more fruit trees, and harvest more coffee reported fewer lean months. We find evidence consistent with path dependence in how households cope with a sequence of environmental hazards, as the reported use of less preferred coping responses to past events (e.g., Hurricane Mitch and the 2009 drought) tended to correlate with their continued use after subsequent hazards. A comparison of coping responses of households affiliated with a farmer-to-farmer institution promoting subsistence-oriented production with those affiliated with cooperatives prioritizing sustainable coffee exports shows that farmer institutions were not strongly correlated with the number of lean months or coping mechanisms.

T1  - Plantations, outgrowers and commercial farming in Africa: agricultural commercialisation and implications for agrarian change
AN  - 1883144829
AB  - Whether or not investments in African agriculture can generate quality employment at scale, avoid dispossessing local people of their land, promote diversified and sustainable livelihoods, and catalyse more vibrant local economies depends on what farming model is pursued. In this Forum, we build on recent scholarship by discussing the key findings of our recent studies in Ghana, Kenya and Zambia. We examined cases of three models of agricultural commercialisation, characterised by different sets of institutional arrangements that link land, labour and capital. The three models are: plantations or estates with on-farm processing; contract farming and outgrower schemes; and medium-scale commercial farming areas. Building on core debates in the critical agrarian studies literature, we identify commercial farming areas and contract farming as producing the most local economic linkages, and plantations/estates as producing more jobs, although these are of low quality and mostly casual. We point to the gender and generational dynamics emerging in the three models, which reflect the changing demand for family and wage labour. Models of agricultural commercialisation do not always deliver what is expected of them in part because local conditions play a critical role in the unfolding outcomes for land relations, labour regimes, livelihoods and local economies.

T1  - Agricultural commercialisation models, agrarian dynamics and local development in Ghana
AN  - 1883142753
AB  - The renewed commitment of African states to modernising agriculture has reignited longstanding debates about different models of agricultural commercialisation. Which forms of commercialisation models will reduce land dispossession and the impoverishment of smallholders, and transform smallholder agriculture and the wider economy? Of the three broad models of agriculture commercialisation in this debate - plantation, contract farming and medium-scale commercial farming - contract farming has been identified as central to the future of Africa's commercial agriculture. This paper provides empirical evidence from Ghana on the impacts of these three models on land, labour/employment, livelihoods and local economic linkages. Our findings show that the plantation and the commercial farming areas have highly commercialised land relations, land scarcity and high land prices, compared to the outgrower area where traditional systems of accessing land still dominate, enabling families to produce their own food crops while also diversifying into wage labour and other activities. Food insecurity was highest in the plantation area followed by the commercial area, but lowest in the outgrower area. Here, semi-proletarianised seasonal workers combine self-provisioning from their own farms with wages, and this results in better livelihood outcomes than for permanent workers in plantations and commercial farms. Due to the processing units in the plantation and the outgrower models, they provided more employment. However, the casualisation of labour and gender discrimination in employment and access to land occur in all three cases. All three models generated strong economic linkages mainly because they combined attributes such as processing, provided markets for nearby farmers, induced state infrastructural development and diffused technology in competitive ways. The effects of the models on household and local development are coproduced by their interaction with pre-existing conditions and wider national economic structures.

T1  - The leakage and livelihood impacts of PES contracts: A targeting experiment in Malawi
AN  - 1939229135
AB  - Most evaluations of payments for environmental services programs focus on immediate environmental impacts, and do not measure the effects on socioeconomic outcomes or on other land use activities (leakage). Efficient allocation of land use contracts, through auctions for example, may help mitigate concerns about adverse livelihood or leakage effects. This study reports on a field experiment that varied the allocation of afforestation contracts to smallholder farmers in Malawi. Households were randomly assigned to participate in an auction or in a lottery for the contracts, which provided three years of payment based on tree survival outcomes. Households that did not receive a contract as a result of the lottery form a pure comparison group. The results show evidence for within-farm leakage for households that received a contract at random, in the form of additional land clearing. Randomly contracted households are also more likely to report household labor shortages. These effects are mitigated to some degree when contracts are assigned through an auction. Together, the results point to leakage and livelihood impacts from payments for environmental services that are often overlooked in standard evaluations, but which may be reduced through improvements in contract targeting.

T1  - The role of collective action in leveraging farmers' performances: Lessons from sesame seed farmers' collaboration in eastern Chad
AN  - 1938549228
AB  - In recent decades, the role of farmers' associations in developing countries has been increasing due to a number of projects promoted by local and international governmental and non-governmental institutions and organizations. This paper analyses the effectiveness of collective action in enhancing farmers' market performances in terms of production quantity, production quality and profit. Specifically, the study points out the role of associations in leveraging smallholder market performance by providing learning, production and network support. In-depth interviews with local sesame value chain actors and a structural equation model based on a survey involving 97 farmers in East Chad are implemented. The farmers involved are part of the EU Project "Peanut and sesame food chain support: from production to marketing" led by a governmental organization. Results show that collective action supportive activities can effectively leverage farmers' market performances. Some policy implications for research and development organizations are finally discussed.

T1  - THE VALUE CHAIN OF EXPORTED WHITELEG SHRIMP: CASE STUDY IN KHANH HOA PROVINCE, VIETNAM
AN  - 1926523297
AB  - This study focuses on systematic mapping and verification of benefit distribution among stakeholders in the value chain of white-leg shrimp in Khanh Hoa Province, Vietnam. The question is, can reorganization of small farmer groups enhance participation and efficiency of the value chain? Convenient sampling and face-to-face interview method were employed in 2014 and 2015 to solicit information from 100 shrimp producers, 10 middlemen and 3 exporters. Males account for 98 percent of small independent producers. There is an involvement of middlemen (middlemen type #1 and middlemen type # 2) in the chain. The middlemen are the drivers in the chain and engage in risk shifting on producers. The distribution of shrimp materials by middlemen type #1 to the processing plant is based on shrimp size. An alternate design to assist collective bargaining by unified small farm *groups shows in order to attain a sustainable value chain for white-leg shrimp, one should improve vertical integration and coordination among the market participants; and seek government intervention to build the image of Vietnam seafood in international markets.

T1  - Characterisation of adopters and non-adopters of dairy technologies in Ethiopia and Kenya
AN  - 1882767031
AB  - While there is a general consensus that using dairy technologies, such as improved breeds of dairy cows, can substantially increase farm productivity and income, adoption of such technologies has been generally low in developing countries. The underlying reasons for non-adoption of beneficial technologies in the dairy sector are not fully understood. In this study, we characterised adopters and non-adopters of dairy technologies in Ethiopia and Kenya based on farmers' resources ownership in order to identify why many farmers in Ethiopia and Kenya have not adopted improved dairy technologies. As compared to non-adopters, farmers who adopt dairy technology own relatively more farm resources. The result signals that differences in resource endowments could lead to divergent technology adoption scenarios. Results show that a higher proportion of sample smallholders in Kenya have adopted dairy technologies than those in Ethiopia. Except for the use of veterinary services, fewer than 10% of sample farmers in Ethiopia have adopted dairy technologies--less than half the number of adopters in Kenya. The higher level of dairy technology adoption in Kenya can be ascribed partly to the long history of dairy development, including improvements in the value chain for the delivery of inputs, services and fluid milk marketing. Interventions that deal with the constraints related to access to farm resources and input and output markets could facilitate uptake of dairy technology in developing countries.

T1  - SUPPORTING SMALLHOLDER COMMERCIALISATION BY ENHANCING INTEGRATED COORDINATION IN AGRIFOOD VALUE CHAINS: EXPERIENCES WITH DAIRY HUBS IN KENYA
AN  - 1871719908
AB  - Recent literature suggests that to make value chains in changing agrifood systems in sub-Saharan Africa more inclusive, intermediary institutions should foster coordination. The hub concept has been applied as such an intermediary institution that coordinates advisory services, input supply and smallholder access to markets. This study unravels hub coordination in smallholder dairy in Kenya, conceptualising the hub as a mix between a broker of relationships, a one-stop-shop for services and a cluster of producers and service providers, enabling horizontal coordination (between smallholders) and vertical coordination (between smallholders and value chain actors and service providers). Findings indicate that, in resolving challenges that limit smallholders' integration in value chains, synergies emerged as the hub combined different types of horizontal and vertical coordination. This was done by simultaneously organising clusters of farmers and input and service providers (clustering role) and actively facilitating delivery (broker and one-stop-shop role), where the hub structure stimulated the matching of demand (better articulation) to supply (better organised access). However, tensions emerged in the combination of horizontal and vertical coordination as farmer organisations as hub operators had to balance a role as an honest broker between farmers with the intent of enhancing collective action and as a business-oriented entity which resulted in the exclusion of some farmers who cannot deliver the quantity and quality required to minimise coordination costs. Given these tensions and capacity problems of farmers' organisations, complementary intermediary arrangements may be necessary to fulfil some coordination roles.

T1  - Contract Farming and Food Security
AN  - 2511816938
AB  - Contract farming has often been associated with an increase in the income of participating households. It is unclear, however, whether contract farming increases other aspects of household welfare. We use data from six regions of Madagascar and a selection‐on‐observables design in which we control for a household's marginal utility of participating in contract farming, which we elicited via a contingent valuation experiment, to show that participating in contract farming reduces the duration of a household's hungry season by about eight days on average. Moreover, participation in contract farming makes participating households about 18% more likely to see their hungry season end at any time. Further, we find that these effects are more pronounced for households with more children, and for households with more girls. This is an important result as children—especially girls—often bear the burden of food insecurity.

T1  - Maize-nutrient response information applied across Sub-Saharan Africa
AN  - 2259852338
AB  - The profit potential for a given investment in fertilizer use can be estimated using representative crop nutrient response functions. Where response data is scarce, determination of representative response functions can be strengthened by using results from homologous crop growing conditions. Maize (Zea mays L.) nutrient response functions were selected from the Optimization of Fertilizer Recommendations in Africa (OFRA) database of 5500 georeferenced response functions determined from field research conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa. Three methods for defining inference domains for selection of response functions were compared. Use of the OFRA Inference Tool (OFRA-IT; http://agronomy.unl.edu/OFRA) resulted in greater specificity of maize N, P, and K response functions with higher R2 values indicating superiority compared with using the Harvest Choice Agroecological Zones (HC-AEZ) and the recommendation domains of the Global Yield Gap Atlas project (GYGA-RD). The OFRA-IT queries three soil properties in addition to climate-related properties while the latter two options use climate properties only. The OFRA-IT was generally insensitive to changes in criteria ranges of 20–25% used in queries suggesting value in using wider criteria ranges compared with the default for information scarce crop nutrient response functions.

T1  - Analysis of Barriers to Development of Malagasy Horticultural Microenterprises in Madagascar
AN  - 2124594513
AB  - The malagasy rural environment and the development of agricultural microenterprises are closely linked. For Ambalavao Atsimondrano located in the suburban area of Antananarivo, Madagascar, the horticultural chain appears as a buoyant sector; many rural or urban households are dependent upon it. Despite the reputation of the region in this field and support from different organizations, Rural Microenterprises (RMEs) encounter problems in their development. This study highlights the factors blocking entrepreneurial development including education of horticultural entrepreneurs and their ability to deal with complex situations. The aim of the study was to identify the factors affecting the growth of RMEs. A focus group on 33 small farmers considered as RMEs was conducted taking into account their individual characteristics. A typology and value chain analysis resulted in their classification and in comprehension of their empowerment in management. The results indicated that there were 3 types of entrepreneurs or promoters: the experienced traditional (36%), the educated young (33%), and the professional young (31%). Ishikawa diagrams highlight the problems related to entrepreneurial development in funding and information systems. Our conclusions insist on the necessity of improving communications strategies among microentrepreneurs, guidance for entering the market, and professionalizing the horticultural trade, while emphasizing the importance of cooperation between producers.

T1  - Editorial: Towards leaner and more effective value chain development
AN  - 2055589802
AB  - Value chain development (VCD) is a common term in today’s development lexicon1, where its use tends to conjure passionate ideas about how development programming can support smallholder participation in growing markets in the interest of economic growth, job creation, gender empowerment, and sustainable use of natural resources, among other goals. Since the early 2000s, Enterprise Development and Microfinance (EDM) has featured considerable debate on how to design market-oriented development interventions with smallholders, often based on positive experiences by a given NGO or project in a particular context. Early articles helped to put VCD on the development agenda, while advancing innovation in market-based project design and implementation. However, after more than a decade of it being firmly placed on the agenda, we still know relatively little about VCD. Apart from isolated case studies, the question of whether VCD has lived up to the expectations of smallholders, of the private sector, and of development agencies remains an open one. This double edition of EDM addresses the design, implementation, and impact of VCD support to smallholders and to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as an important, yet under-researched dimension of VCD. The eight articles look into the needs and opportunities for increasing the effectiveness of VCD support services, with discussions on: the role of NGOs or governments in VCD; how large-scale buyers and certification programs shape VCD; and the role of finance and impact bonds in VCD. Advancing ideas on how to get the right mix of services, at the right time, to the right people, taking into account variations in the context in which livelihoods and business activities are embedded, will help stakeholders to effectively deliver on poverty and broader development goals.

T1  - Value chain development in Nicaragua: prevailing approaches and tools used for design and implementation
AN  - 2055575470
AB  - This article draws on four contrasting cases of value chain development (VCD) in Nicaragua to assess approaches and tools used in design and implementation. We interviewed 28 representatives from the international NGOs leading the interventions, the local NGOs that participated in implementation, principal buyers, and cooperatives. Despite the complexity of market systems, results showed a relatively basic approach to VCD, reflected in: 1) reliance on a single tool for design and implementation; 2) expected outcomes based on technical assistance and training for smallholders and cooperatives; 3) local NGOs and cooperatives with key roles in implementation; and 4) limited engagement with other chain actors, service providers, and researchers. We conclude with a call for a broader approach to VCD, based on a combination of tools to account for multiple, context-specific needs of diverse stakeholders, deeper collaboration between key actors within and outside the value chain, and evidence-based reflection and learning.

T1  - Development impact bonds: learning from the Asháninka cocoa and coffee case in Peru
AN  - 2055574662
AB  - Impact bonds effectively allow the risk of implementing social development activities to be shared with private sector investors. Social or development impact bonds replace the upfront financing of charitable activities with a pay-for-success contract. Four actors together agree upon the outcomes and their indicators: outcome sponsor, investor, project implementers, and verifier. Under such a contract, a charitable donor or government (‘outcome sponsor’) takes the obligation to pay the ‘investor’ an amount determined by a set of objective indicators reflecting the outcome desired by the donor. The investor, expecting contract-based future payout, can recruit and pre-finance project implementers (‘service provider’) to achieve the agreed results. The achievements of the outcome indicators are assessed by an independent verifier to conclude the payout from donor to investor according to the contract. The structure allows charitable donors to transfer a significant share of risk to investors and/or financial markets. The Common Fund for Commodities (CFC), the Schmidt Family Foundation (SFF), Rainforest Foundation UK (RFUK), and the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT) were the first to apply the model in the agricultural sector in an emerging economy. The main objective of the impact bond was to increase productivity and market sales of cocoa and coffee produced by the Asháninka people, an indigenous community living in the Peruvian Amazon. This pilot provides valuable lessons learned to contribute to the development of the mechanism.

T1  - Value chain financing: evidence from Zambia on smallholder access to finance for mechanization
AN  - 2055574534
AB  - Smallholder farmers in Zambia comprise 85 per cent of the farmers’ population. Such farmers are regarded as not creditworthy and furthermore their agricultural productivity could be improved. The aim of this paper is to present recent evidence on value chain financing (VCF) as a framework to increase access to agricultural finance for Zambian smallholder farmers. Such financing will act as an enabler to mechanize and, in turn, might improve productivity. Qualitative data collection techniques were followed to provide the results as presented in three illustrative case studies. Each case study highlights the benefits of financing, using the value chain framework, but also emphasizes certain challenges and risks associated with the approach. The Zambian case is not perfect, but provides recent evidence of how various roleplayers in Zambia’s agricultural sector have applied the VCF framework to coordinate the actions of various chain actors, and by doing so allow smallholders access to finance within the local and country-specific context. Although two of the three VCF programmes have been discontinued, they still provide useful learning points: for instance, commercial banks should assign more resources to manage the VCF products; and the risk should be shared between all the VCF participants.

T1  - Value chain development in Vietnam: a look at approaches used and options for improved impact
AN  - 2055573686
AB  - Despite the widespread use of value chain development (VCD) approaches to poverty reduction, there has been limited debate on how VCD is implemented in the field, from the approaches, methods, and tools used, to the investments and partnerships made. The article presents five case studies: tea, dairy, horticulture, cinnamon, and fish in Vietnam. For each case, we conducted interviews with development agencies, producer organizations, and principal buyers. The cases examined how VCD interventions were designed, the role of different stakeholders in the implementation process, and the challenges faced by practitioners and chain actors to achieve impact at scale. Results suggest that VCD interventions tended to focus on supporting smallholder participation in high-value, fast-growing markets, but based on a narrow set of activities, mainly around upgrading smallholder production capacities and establishing producer associations. Overall, collaboration with downstream buyers and service providers was muted and, in a few cases, non-existent. Opportunities for increased impact exist based on increased collaboration between practitioners and researchers to employ VCD tools in specific contexts, as well as to design new tools for addressing specific needs and facilitate joint learning on the implementation process and related outcomes. The findings also suggest a need for dedicated approaches to supporting producer organizations, given their central role in the implementation of VCD interventions.

T1  - Crossfire: 'Private sector engagement in smallholder value chains'
AN  - 2055573357
AB  - Improved access by disadvantaged smallholders and other poor people to lucrative agri-food value chains remains one of the most promising options for reducing rural poverty at scale. There is general agreement that the private sector plays a critical role in building value chains with the rural poor; however, debate in EDM and elsewhere has said little about the conditions under which the private sector is willing and able to lead the way in building inclusive value chains. This crossfire brings together two experts, John Belt of the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT) and Jonathan Hellin of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), to debate the following proposition: Value chains are more likely to include and substantially benefit large numbers of poor producers, and to continue to do so, if they are initiated, financed and managed by private for-profit businesses rather than by donors or NGOs.

T1  - Land grabbing, social differentiation, intensified migration and food security in northern Ghana
AN  - 1884099100; 4797875
AB  - This paper argues that large-scale land appropriation is displacing subsistence farmers and reworking agrarian social relations in northern Ghana. The recent wave of farmland enclosure has not only resulted in heightened land scarcity, but also fostered a marked social differentiation within farming communities. The dominant form of inequality is an evolving class of landless and near-landless farmers. The majority of households cope with such dynamics by deepening their own self-exploitation in the production process. The fulcrum of this self-exploitation is gendered property rights as part of the conjugal contract, with men exerting a far greater monopoly over land resources than had previously been the case. Due to acute land shortages, women's rights to use land as wives, mothers and daughters are becoming insecure, as their vegetable plots are being reclassified as male-controlled household fields. The paper further documents the painful choices that landless farmers have to make in order to meet livelihood needs, including highly disciplined, yet low-waged, farm labor work and sharecropping contracts. In these livelihood pathways, there emerge, again, exploitative relations of production, whereby surplus is expropriated from land-dispossessed migrant laborers and concentrated with farm owners. These dynamics produce a 'simple reproduction squeeze' for the land-dispossessed. Overall, the paper contributes to the emerging land grabbing literature by showing geographically specific processes of change for large-scale mining operations and gendered differentiated impacts.

T1  - Land grabbing, social differentiation, intensified migration and food security in northern Ghana
AN  - 1877540450
AB  - This paper argues that large-scale land appropriation is displacing subsistence farmers and reworking agrarian social relations in northern Ghana. The recent wave of farmland enclosure has not only resulted in heightened land scarcity, but also fostered a marked social differentiation within farming communities. The dominant form of inequality is an evolving class of landless and near-landless farmers. The majority of households cope with such dynamics by deepening their own self-exploitation in the production process. The fulcrum of this self-exploitation is gendered property rights as part of the conjugal contract, with men exerting a far greater monopoly over land resources than had previously been the case. Due to acute land shortages, women's rights to use land as wives, mothers and daughters are becoming insecure, as their vegetable plots are being reclassified as male-controlled household fields. The paper further documents the painful choices that landless farmers have to make in order to meet livelihood needs, including highly disciplined, yet low-waged, farm labor work and sharecropping contracts. In these livelihood pathways, there emerge, again, exploitative relations of production, whereby surplus is expropriated from land-dispossessed migrant laborers and concentrated with farm owners. These dynamics produce a 'simple reproduction squeeze' for the land-dispossessed. Overall, the paper contributes to the emerging land grabbing literature by showing geographically specific processes of change for large-scale mining operations and gendered differentiated impacts.

T1  - Mismatches between mill-cultivated sugarcane and smallholding farming in Brazil: Environmental and socioeconomic impacts
AN  - 1939227390
AB  - Brazil is a country historically characterized by high levels of capital and land ownership concentration, and some areas where family farming is traditionally strong are potentially impacted by the expansion of sugarcane, through land renting contracts between farmers (landowners) and sugar mills (tenants). This paper examines the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of mill-cultivated sugarcane expansion on family farming in the municipality of Ipiranga de Goiás, Goiás state, Brazil, where sugarcane plantations compete with corn, pasture and dairy cattle. Using a questionnaire composed of closed-and open-ended questions, we interviewed 28 family farmers, which were divided into two groups: those with and those without land renting contracts with the ethanol and sugar mill. The results show differences between both groups, such as average area size, main source of income, past and current activities, and perceptions about the pros and cons of sugarcane expansion. Land leasing emerged as a short-term solution to the shortage of on-farm labor and other economic difficulties small farmers continue to face. There are some farmers, however, who have resisted leasing their land for a number of reasons, including revenue is too low due to the small area in question; they also want to avoid loss of autonomy in production and the deep transformation of their rural way of life and landscape.

T1  - Large-Scale Agricultural Investments and Smaliholder Welfare: A Comparison of Wage Labor and Outgrower Channels in Tanzania
AN  - 1884096442; 4798805
AB  - This article evaluates household welfare effects of large-scale agricultural investments in Tanzania, one of the main recipients of such investments in Africa. Specifically, the article compares households participating in sugar and rice investments through out-grower schemes or as agro-industry workers with non-participants in terms of household income and income poverty. Building on primary household data, it is one of the first studies to empirically analyze ex-post impacts of large-scale agricultural investments in Africa. The analysis draws on cross-section survey data of 516 households collected in Kilombero District, a priority cluster for the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT). The results show overall positive household welfare differences between participants of the investments and the respective counterfactual. However, there are large differences between arrangements and subsectors. Estimated effects for outgrowers are largest, yet for land-rich outgrowers more so than for land-poor. Effects for agro-industry workers in the sugar investment are significantly larger than for those in the rice investment, though in both investments land-poor workers seem to benefit. Hence, the study results suggest potential benefits of outgrower schemes and potentials of agro-industry wage employment for the land-poor to escape extreme poverty. Yet, it also stresses particularly the need to address the constraints of land-poor outgrowers. Qualitative interviews, for example, pointed to growing risks for land-poor outgrowers in the context of rising elite capture by larger outgrowers. All rights reserved, Elsevier

T1  - Quantitative risk assessment of human salmonellosis in the smallholder pig value chains in urban of Vietnam
AN  - 1876677926
AB  - Objectives

              
To quantify salmonellosis risk in humans through consumption of boiled pork in urban Hung Yen Province, Vietnam, using a quantitative microbial risk assessment.

              
Methods

              
We collected 302 samples along the pork value chain in Hung Yen between April 2014 and February 2015. We developed a model in @Risk, based on microbiological, market, and household surveys on cooking, cross-contamination and consumption, and conducted sensitivity analysis.

              
Results

              
Salmonella prevalence of pen floor swabs, slaughterhouse carcasses and cut pork were 33.3, 41.7 and 44.4%, respectively. The annual incidence rate of salmonellosis in humans was estimated to be 17.7% (90% CI 0.89-45.96). Parameters with the greatest influence risk were household pork handling practice followed by prevalence in pork sold in the central market. Wide confidence interval in the incidence estimate was mainly due to the variability in the degree of reduction in bacteria concentration by cooking, and pork consumption pattern.

              
Conclusions

              
The risk of salmonellosis in humans due to boiled pork consumption appears to be high. Control measures may include improving the safety of retailed pork and improving household hygiene.

T1  - Can coffee certification schemes increase incomes of smallholder farmers? Evidence from Jinotega, Nicaragua
AN  - 1865259156
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of Fairtrade and organic certification on household income of smallholder coffee farmers in the Jinotega Municipality of Nicaragua. Using a sample of 233 coffee farming households and employing endogenous switching regression model and propensity score matching method, the results found that Fairtrade and organic certification standards have different effects on the certified farmers; while Fairtrade farmers had experienced yield gains, organic farmers had the price advantage. However, the overall impact of these certification standards on the total household income is found to be statistically not significant. While some of the Fairtrade-certified cooperatives have used the social premium in creating community-level infrastructure, there is a need for more investment. The major constraint the organic-certified farmers face is lack of availability of adequate organic inputs such as manures and organic herbicides.

T1  - Improving dairy production in Malawi: a literature review
AN  - 1865256532
AB  - Milk production in Malawi is stagnating while steadily increasing in neighboring countries. We performed a literature review to identify factors negatively affecting milk production in Malawi and propose potential solutions to overcome the particular constraints. We structured the analysis along the value chain with three major components: upstream providers, on-farm production, and downstream providers. It is shown that the literature strongly focuses on on-farm constraints and most prominently on animal health, breed choice, and milk yield. The literature research did not reveal any reasons specific to Malawi that would hinder an increase in milk production as experienced in neighboring countries. We suggest a focus on crossbreeds accompanied by local breeding programs, which would reduce dependence on imported semen and strengthen the currently unreliable artificial insemination services. In addition, crossbreeds may be better suited than pure breeds for current feeding practices and climate conditions and thus come close to reaching their genetic potential. We conclude that cost advantages of crossbreeds clearly compensate for the lower revenues compared with exotic breeds such as Holstein-Friesian or Jersey.

T1  - Migrant workers into contract farmers: processes of labour mobilization in colonial and contemporary Mozambique
AN  - 1862471802
AB  - As contract farming gains ground as a form of agricultural production in Southern Africa, there is growing interest in its effects on patterns of investment and production as well as in its potential to provide small farmers with access to export markets. However, the relation between contract farming and the region's long history of labour migration has largely escaped analysts and scholars working on Southern Africa. This article traces the changing livelihoods of those who experienced the demise of the migrant labour system and displacement during the civil war, and who now engage in contract farming in Angónia, a densely populated district in Tete Province, central Mozambique. In the decades since the end of the war, contract farming thrived among former migrants with access to land and few alternative sources of income and employment. If historical labour migration from Angónia involved attempts by employers to externalize the responsibility for social reproduction onto households, contract farming amounts to the internalization by households of the opportunities, risks and tensions involved in the production of high-value export commodities. By analysing farmers' accounts of producing under contract and linking this to their households' longer histories of labour mobilization, this article sheds light on people's experiences of working for wages, working on their own account and hiring workers, as households became the new sites of commodity production.

T1  - Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices Related to African Swine Fever Within Smallholder Pig Production in Northern Uganda
AN  - 1855254868
AB  - Summary              Uganda is a low-income country with the largest pig population in East Africa. Pig keeping has a large potential, commercially and as a tool for poverty reduction, but African swine fever (ASF) is a major hurdle for development of the sector. The objective of this study was to evaluate knowledge, attitudes and practices related to ASF in the smallholder pig production value chain in northern Uganda. The study included three separate series of participatory rural appraisals (PRA), comprising purposively selected farmers and other actors in the pig production value chain. In the PRAs, various participatory epidemiology tools were used. A total of 49 PRAs and 574 participants, representing 64 different villages, were included. The results indicate that participants were well aware of the clinical signs of ASF, routes for disease spread and measures for disease control. However, awareness of the control measures did not guarantee their implementation. A majority of middlemen and butchers acknowledged having sold live pigs, carcasses or pork they believed infected with ASF. Outbreaks of ASF had a strong negative impact on participants' socio-economic status with loss of revenue and reversal into more severe poverty. In conclusion, lack of knowledge is not what is driving the continuous circulation of ASF virus in this setting. To control ASF and reduce its impact, initiatives that stimulate changes in management are needed. Because the behaviour of all actors in the value chain is largely influenced by the deep rural poverty in the region, this needs to be combined with efforts to reduce rural poverty.

T1  - Quantitative risk assessment of human salmonellosis in the smallholder pig value chains in urban of Vietnam
AN  - 1845057088; 2016-55193-001
AB  - Objectives: To quantify salmonellosis risk in humans through consumption of boiled pork in urban Hung Yen Province, Vietnam, using a quantitative microbial risk assessment. Methods: We collected 302 samples along the pork value chain in Hung Yen between April 2014 and February 2015. We developed a model in @Risk, based on microbiological, market, and household surveys on cooking, cross-contamination and consumption, and conducted sensitivity analysis. Results: 
Salmonella prevalence of pen floor swabs, slaughterhouse carcasses and cut pork were 33.3, 41.7 and 44.4%, respectively. The annual incidence rate of salmonellosis in humans was estimated to be 17.7% (90% CI 0.89–45.96). Parameters with the greatest influence risk were household pork handling practice followed by prevalence in pork sold in the central market. Wide confidence interval in the incidence estimate was mainly due to the variability in the degree of reduction in bacteria concentration by cooking, and pork consumption pattern. Conclusions: The risk of salmonellosis in humans due to boiled pork consumption appears to be high. Control measures may include improving the safety of retailed pork and improving household hygiene.

T1  - ROOT PROBLEM OF SUPPLY CHAIN COLLABORATIVE PRACTICES AND STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF SMALLHOLDERS BEEF CATTLE FARMING IN RURAL AREAS
AN  - 1954227938
AB  - Low competitive advantage of smallholders beef cattle farming is a serious problem to enhance the livelihood of rural smallholders in developing countries, including Indonesia. The low competitive advantage of local beef cattle demonstrates a noticeable difficulty in terms of collaborative practices between actors in supply chain. Therefore, this study objectives is to explore root problems of collaborative practices, determine which the root problems cause low competitive advantage of smallholders beef cattle farming. Then, formulate strategies to improve the competitive advantage based on the root problems. The study was organized in three phases of research methods. In first phase, survey research method and Relative Important Index (RII) were used. In second phase, focus group discussion (FGD) and Fishbone analysis were used. In third phase, FGD and formulation strategy analysis was used. The results of the first phase, RII analysis show that there are slightly different perception among smallholder and traders on main root problems of collaborative practices. Thus, the result of the second phase, participant of the FGD agreed that goal congruence with information sharing was a root problems which cause the low competitive advantage. And finally, the result of third phase, participant of the FGD suggested key strategies to improve the competitive advantage, namely developing social capital, improving technologies and farm management practices, improving beef cattle logistic system, and organizing smallholder and traders into beef cattle supply chains groups.

T1  - The effectiveness of contract farming for raising income of smallholder farmers in low‐ and middle‐income countries: a systematic review
AN  - 2568048443
AB  - This Campbell systematic review examines the impact of contract farming on income and food security of smallholder farmers in low‐ and middle‐income countries. The review summarises findings from 75 reports, of which 22 (covering 26 contract farming interventions) were used for meta‐analysisContract farming may substantially increase farmer income with an average effect in the range of 23 to 54 per cent. There is upward bias in the estimate because of survivor bias in individual studies (no data on farmers who drop out of schemes) and in the body of evidence (no studies on contract farming arrangements that collapsed in their initial years), and publication bias in the literature (under‐reporting of insignificant outcomes). Therefore, some caution is needed in interpreting the findings.For farmers to give up their autonomy in marketing and prevent side‐selling, substantial income gains need to be offered. This is especially so for annual crops and when firms have contracts directly with farmers rather than through a cooperative.Poorer farmers are not usually part of contract farming schemes. In 61% of the cases, contract farmers had significantly larger landholdings or more assets than the average farmers in the region.Plain language summaryThe effectiveness of contract farming for raising income of smallholder farmers in low‐ and middle‐income countriesThe evidence suggests that contract farming arrangements need to offer clear incentives to farmers in order to survive over time.The review in briefContract farming, a sales arrangement between a farmer and a firm, is popular with government and donors. Contract farming can produce substantial income gains for farmers. Moreover, these benefits may well be required for contract farming schemes to survive. Better‐off farmers are most likely to participate in contract farming schemes.What is this review about?Contract farming is a sales arrangement agreed before production begins, which provides the farmer with resources or services. The service package provided by the firm varies per location, and can include transport, certification, input provisioning and credit.This systematic review summarises evidence on income effects for smallholders to assess average effects and explore combinations of factors that increase these effects.What studies are included?Included studies had to examine the impact of contract farming on income and food security of smallholder farmers in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Studies had to use a comparison group with appropriate statistical methods to allow for selection effects.Seventy‐five studies were identified with quantitative estimates of the impact of contract farming of which 22 studies, covering 7,471 respondents, were of sufficient rigour to include in the meta‐analysis of income effects. The meta‐analysis covers 26 empirical instances of contract farming in 13 developing countries.What is the aim of this review?This Campbell systematic review examines the impact of contract farming on income and food security of smallholder farmers in low‐ and middle‐income countries. The review summarises findings from 75 reports, of which 22 (covering 26 contract farming interventions) were used for meta‐analysis.What are the main findings of this review?Contract farming may substantially increase farmer income with an average effect in the range of 23 to 54 per cent. There is upward bias in the estimate because of survivor bias in individual studies (no data on farmers who drop out of schemes) and in the body of evidence (no studies on contract farming arrangements that collapsed in their initial years), and publication bias in the literature (under‐reporting of insignificant outcomes). Therefore, some caution is needed in interpreting the findings.For farmers to give up their autonomy in marketing and prevent side‐selling, substantial income gains need to be offered. This is especially so for annual crops and when firms have contracts directly with farmers rather than through a cooperative.Poorer farmers are not usually part of contract farming schemes. In 61% of the cases, contract farmers had significantly larger landholdings or more assets than the average farmers in the region.What do the findings of this review mean?Contract farming covers a wide range of contractual arrangements. This heterogeneity makes it difcult to draw general conclusions from the literature published on this topic. The lack of studies on ‘failed treatments’ leads to an overestimation of the effectiveness of contract farming.Moreover, the analysis suggests a marked publication bias; all studies report on at least one case of contract farming that has a positive and statistical significant income effect.Relatively larger or richer farmers can cope better with these risks and are, therefore, more likely to take part in a contractual arrangement. This implies that contract farming is more suited to the relatively better‐off segment of the farming population.Further research should: (1) improve reporting of the intervention; (2) document the less‐successful instances of contract farming, and report inconclusive results (insignificant effects); and (3) capture other outcomes of contract farming such as (sector‐wide) innovation, and livelihood resilience.How up‐to‐date is this review?The review authors searched for studies published up to October 2015. This Campbell systematic review was published in December 2017.Executive summary/AbstractBackgroundContract farming is used by an increasing number of firms as a preferred modality to source products from smallholder farmers in low and middle‐income countries. Quality requirements of consumers, economies of scale in production or land ownership rights are common incentives for firms to offer contractual arrangements to farmers. Prices and access to key technology, key inputs or support services are the main incentives for farmers to enter into these contracts. There is great heterogeneity in contract farming, with differences in contracts, farmers, products, buyers, and institutional environments. The focus of this review lies on contract farming, defined as:“a contractual arrangement for a fixed term between a farmer and a firm, agreed verbally or in writing before production begins, which provides material or financial resources to the farmer and specifies one or more product or process requirements for agricultural production on land owned or controlled by the farmer, which gives the firm legal title to (most of) the crop or livestock” (Adapted from Prowse, 2012:12).The last decade shows a rapid increase in studies that use quasi‐experimental research designs to assess the effects of specific empirical instances of contract farming on smallholders. The objective of this systematic review was to distill generalised inferences from this rapidly growing body of evidence.ObjectivesThe review synthesised the studies in order to answer two questions:• Question 1: What is known about the effect size of contract farming on income and food security of smallholder farmers in low‐ and middle‐income countries?• Question 2: Under which enabling or limiting conditions are contract farming arrangements effective for improving income and food security of smallholdersSearch methodsA comprehensive electronic search was applied to Scopus, CAB Abstracts, Econlit, Web of Science, Tropag & Rural, and Agricola between 30 September and 21 October 2015. Snowballing the reference list in review articles and other repositories of research (e.g. worldwidescience.org, FAO, World Bank, Google Scholar) added more studies to the review. The search results were uploaded in EPPI Reviewer 4 and screened for relevance and the rigour of analysis of the effect estimates, in order to combine these results in a meta‐analysis of effectiveness. The main terms used to identify the pool of studies within which we expected to find studies that covered the effectiveness of contract farming arrangements were: contract farming, nucleus estate, cooperative, producer organisation, pre‐harvest agreement, value chain, farm‐firm, outgrower, and vertical integration.Selection criteriaEach study selected for the meta‐analysis was required to resolve the counterfactual, that is, to use a comparison group to mimic the expected situation of farmers not having a contract. When assessing net‐effects, the characteristics of groups with or without a contract needed to be fairly similar. Ideally, the only difference was the condition of having a contract or not. Because firms tend to offer contracts to farmers having certain characteristics and farmers self‐select when they accept or reject the offer, econometric methods are required to credibly assess the net‐effects of contract farming.To be included in the review, studies needed to analyse the impact of the intervention on income or food security of smallholder farmers. However, only one study was found with food security as an outcome variable (Bellemare & Novak, 2017); all other studies included focused on income effects. The review, therefore, has a focus on the income effects of contract farming and a meta‐analysis explored this outcome.Data collection and analysisThe electronic search retrieved 8,529 unique studies. After the full‐text screening, 195 studies were found to present research on contract farming. We excluded all papers that did not study the effectiveness of contract farming. The remaining set of papers was referred to as the core set and consisted of 75 studies that presented quantitative outcomes on smallholder farmers. Of the 75 studies in the core set, most did not meet the criteria for methodological and econometric rigour and had to be excluded from the meta‐analysis. The meta‐analysis was based on data from 22 studies, covering 28 empirical instances of contract farming, two of which had insufficient data to use in the meta‐analysis. The studies covered 7,471 respondents.ResultsWe applied meta‐analysis on the studies that reported income effects. Based on the significance levels and effect sizes, we showed that the set of studies selected for meta‐analysis suffered from publication bias. All studies reported at least one empirical instance with a statistically significant positive income effect. Test results suggested that studies with non‐significant effects of contract farming are likely to exist but are not reported in the academic literature. Studies also suffer from survivor bias. All studies are cross‐sectional studies that assess the effectiveness of the contractual arrangement at one moment in time, but only after the contractual arrangements had been in place for some years when these had already survived the start‐up problems. This implies that contractual arrangements that had ceased to function are absent in the literature. The publication and survivor bias detected in this review preclude strong conclusions on the income effects of contract farming arrangements.The one study that analysed effects on food security reported a positive result (the duration of the hungry season was 8% [95% confidence interval= 0%,15%] lower for farmers having a contract). The meta‐analysis of the 22 studies showed that the average income effect of participation in these contractual arrangement is highly heterogeneous. The (uncorrected) pooled average effect‐size on the proxy for income used in each study, computed in the meta‐analysis, indicated a 62 percent increase (95% confidence interval=40%, 87%) in income for contract farmers over incomes of non‐contract farmers. However, strong evidence for publication bias suggests that the true effect of contract farming is likely to be much lower, although still substantially higher than non‐contract farming. When we consider these studies representative for enduring contract farming arrangements in general, the pooled average income effect is estimated in 38% (95% confidence interval=23%, 54%).In almost two‐thirds of the studies, the contracted farmers proved to have significantly larger holdings or to be richer than the average farmers in the area. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon, as mentioned in the studies, is that there are lower transaction costs with increasing farm scale and the capacity of the better‐endowed farmers to bear the production and post‐harvest quality risks inherent to contract farming arrangements. In the four studies in which contract farmers had relatively smaller than average plot sizes, the income effects are relatively low.Authors’ conclusionsContract farming is a container concept that covers a wide range of contractual arrangements. This heterogeneity makes it difcult to draw general conclusions from the literature published on this topic. The studies have a marked publication bias. All studies report at least one case of contract farming that has a positive and statistical significant income effect. Moreover, due to limits inherent to the (cross‐sectional) study designs used in these investigations, the estimated effect size is upward biased. The lack of studies on ‘failed treatments’ leads to an overestimation of the effectiveness of contract farming.Nevertheless, the results of the meta‐analysis suggest that contract farming arrangements need to offer clear incentives to farmers in order to survive over time in the context of free entry and exit of farmers. We generated the hypothesis that relatively large positive effects on income may be a precondition for farmers to continue the contractual arrangements with the firm and give up their autonomy in marketing, production and quality control. High benefits are needed to keep an arrangement attractive and to prevent farmers from dropping out.Modest expectations and careful planning are needed for contract farming to be effective and sustainable. The practitioner‐oriented literature indicated the high risk of failure in the first years and stressed the need for adaptive management and mechanisms to settle disputes. Whereas it is unlikely that contract farming arrangements will on average result in the income effects that we derived from the meta‐analysis, it shows the need for substantial income effects for contract farming arrangements to survive over time. If farmers may opt out of a contract ‐ which was the case in all empirical instances covered by the studies except oil palm in Indonesia ‐ those contractual arrangements having low effects are likely to disappear or be amended, and negative effects on smallholder well‐being are unlikely.Contract farming is an institutional arrangement that may be attractive for farmers who want to get access to services or inputs that they cannot obtain in the traditional (spot) market, or reach markets that are more remunerative. Farmers who are able to enter a contract farming arrangement tend not to be the poorest farmers in their region. Both firms and farmers face risks of non‐compliance. Relatively larger or richer farmers can cope better with these risks and are, therefore, more likely to take part in a contractual arrangement. This implies that contract farming is more suited to the relatively better‐off segment of the farming population. For annual crops, a price premium seems to be a necessary component of the service package in order to result in high income effects for farmers, especially in situations where no cooperative is involved as an intermediary between the firm and the farmers.

AB  - El sector cooperativo campesino cubano ha logrado diversificar e incrementar la producción y mejorar su aporte en alimentos frescos y de calidad, en medio de las condiciones difíciles que han prevalecido para la agricultura en Cuba, por la alta capacidad de resistencia y sostenibilidad que caracteriza la vida y la agricultura campesina. El Movimiento Agroecológico de Campesino a Campesino (MACaC) de la Asociación Nacional de Agricultores Pequeños (ANAP), desde los primeros momentos y hasta nuestros días, aporta los procedimientos y técnicas participativas que propician los procesos de intercambio y aprendizaje entre las familias, el personal dirigente, técnicos e investigadores, posibilita identificar y reconocer líderes productivos y vocaciones individuales y colectivas que después, dotados de las propias herramientas metodológicas, se desarrollan como promotores y facilitadores un proceso que en diferentes grados y perfiles se va extendiendo por ese gran grupo meta que integran las familias campesinas; así mismo en un espectro más amplio de la comunicación, propicia espacios análisis críticos y de construcción colectiva de conocimientos, desde una perspectiva mucho más compartida. El MACaC es conducido por equipos de coordinación en las instancias nacional e intermedias del movimiento, los facilitadores (más de tres mil) a nivel de las cooperativas y los promotores agroecológicos campesinos (más de 16 mil) con sus familias como formidables maestros y comunicadores sociales, además convirtieron a sus parcelas en laboratorios para la experimentación y demostración y sus viviendas en aulas para el aprendizaje colectivo. Al movimiento están integradas más de 130 mil familias campesinas en todo el país.Alternate abstract:The cooperative Cuban peasant sector has been able to diversify and to increase the production and to improve its contribution in fresh foods and of quality, amid the difficult conditions prevailing for agriculture in Cuba, for the high resistance capacity and sustainability that characterizes the rural life and agriculture. The Agroecological Movement Peasant to Peasant (MACaC) of the National Association of Small Farmers (ANAP), from the first times and until nowadays, contributes with procedures and participatory techniques that propitiate the exchange and learning processes among the families, leaders, technicians and researchers, which allow to identify and to recognize productive leaders and individual and collective vocations that later, endowed with the own methodological tools, become promoters and facilitators of a process that goes extending for that great group in different degrees and profiles that integrate the rural families. Likewise a wider spectrum of communication, favorable spaces, critical analysis and a collective construction of knowledge, from a much more shared perspective. The MACaC is driven by coordination teams in the national and intermediate levels of the movement, the facilitators (more than three thousand) at the level of cooperatives and the rural agroecological promoters (more than 16 thousand) with its families like formidable teachers and social communicators that also transformed their farms in laboratories for the experimentation and demonstration and their houses in classrooms for the collective learning. In the movement are integrated more than 130 thousand rural families in the whole country.

It is analyzed the role of cooperatives, small farmers, NGOs, universities, research centers, towards increasing national agroecological educación conscience in order to produce efficient, economic and healthy foods. The integration among biophysical and socioeconomic aspects towards the agroecology transit is still lacking, however, there are several fortresses such as the State Law to give new lands granted under usufruct and the state priority to the local development.

T1  - The integration of smallholders in agricultural value chain activities and food security: evidence from rural Tanzania
AN  - 1987857115
AB  - The integration of smallholders into agricultural value chains is considered an important pathway for raising the welfare of farmers, including their food security. Distinct from literature that has mainly dwelt on smallholder integration in high-value and export-orientated agricultural value chains (AVCs), we focus on domestic, traditional AVCs, which are relevant to the majority of smallholders. Using primary household data from Kilosa and Chamwino districts in rural Tanzania, we examined the nature and extent of smallholder participation in traditional AVC activities and their associated welfare effects, focusing primarily on household food security. Cluster analysis was used to explore different smallholder livelihood activities and the extent of participation in traditional AVCs while propensity score matching and inverse probability weighted regression adjustment approaches were employed to analyze food security effects of various AVC activities. Results revealed that smallholders participate at varying levels in different AVC activities and their integration in traditional AVCs plays an important role in improving food security. Whereas other studies analyze only the impacts of participation in single AVC activities, we show the relevance of assessing the effects of multiple AVC activities on food security. Findings highlight the importance of promoting policies that enable effective vertical and horizontal integration of smallholder farmers into traditional AVC activities for enhanced food security and improved livelihoods.

T1  - Understanding the timber value chain in community-based forestry in Indonesia: Analysis of sengon in central Java
AN  - 1957737388
AB  - The commercial opportunities for sengon (Paraserianthes falcataria L. Nielsen) are expanding rapidly in Indonesia, but there remains a lack of supply for the processing industry of the desired volume and quality of timber for processing from this fast-grown tree. This article discusses recent analysis of the value chain of sengon in Indonesia to determine (i) who the stakeholders were and how each added value, and (ii) how the benefits were distributed among stakeholders. Information was collected from a mix of farmers (as tree growers) and other actors involved in the value chain. The research revealed two broad types of value chains for sengon-'direct' and 'traditional', with the potential increased income for farmers being as high as 35% when they use the direct approach, compared to the traditional approach. As expected, the further 'downstream' the position of the stakeholder in the value chain, the greater the monetary value added to the sengon timber and subsequent products. If farmers were to acquire a greater understanding of the market dynamics for sengon, they could better target the sale of their forest products to specific market segments and make forestry a more profitable enterprise. While village traders in the traditional value chain play an important role connecting small-scale tree growers to commercial markets, the sustained viability of their role is uncertain if more farmers adopt the 'direct' approach.

T1  - Práctica social y cultural del campesinado cafetero en cuatro municipios de Caldas (Colombia)
TT  - Social and Cultural Practices of Coffee Farmers in Four Municipalities of Caldas (Colombia)
AN  - 1945836173
AB  - This article, which is the result of a research project carried out in the Department of Anthropology and Sociology of the Universidad de Caldas, analyzes socio-cultural variables among coffee pickers in central Caldas, a zone where coffee growing is technologically advanced, and small coffee growers in the northern and western parts of the department of Caldas, covering four municipalities. Following the socio-cultural identity methodology developed by professors of the Universidad de Sevilla, the study includes the following variables: family relations, associationism, and sociability, which are significant elements in the social practice of these two social groups. Said methodology is applied to the above mentioned social collectives of coffee growers in Caldas, highlighting social practice outside the field of production, in order to differentiate it from the description and analysis of purely economic factors, as is usually done in this type of study. This,however, does not mean that this aspect is left out. The article is the result of field work that focused particularly on the observation of work processes and behavior in places other than work environments during harvest and inactive periods. Semi-structured and in-depth interviews were also carried out with coffee pickers, small farmers, leaders of two indigenous reservations, and employers in villages, farms, and public places in the municipalities considered to be representative of the two social groups: Chinchiná and Palestina, in the case of coffee pickers during harvest season, and Riosucio and Salamina, in the case of farmers.Alternate abstract:Este artículo, producto de una investigación realizada en el Departamento de Antropología y Sociología de la Universidad de Caldas, analiza las variables de índole sociocultural en los recolectores del café de la zona centro de Caldas, donde se encuentra la caficultura más tecnificada, y en pequeños productores cultivadores del grano de la zona norte y de la zona occidental, es decir, en cuatro municipios del departamento de Caldas. El estudio incluye las variables relaciones de familia, asociacionismo y sociabilidad, que conforman elementos significativos de la práctica social de estos dos grupos sociales, siguiendo la referencia metodológica de la identidad sociocultural propuesta por antropólogos de la Universidad de Sevilla. Se aplica esta metodología a los colectivos sociales de la caficultura caldense mencionados y se destaca la práctica social por fuera del ámbito productivo para diferenciar la descripción y el análisis de lo exclusivamente económico, tan predominante en este tipo de estudios, lo cual no significa que no se tome en cuenta este aspecto.Este artículo es fruto de un trabajo de campo que se hizo especialmente mediante la observación de los procesos de trabajo y de comportamiento en sitios distintos a los laborales durante periodos de cosecha y de tiempo "frío". También se utilizaron entrevistas semiestructuradas y en profundidad a recolectores, pequeños productores, líderes de dos resguardos indígenas y a empleadores en veredas, fincas y sitios públicos de los municipios considerados representativos de ambos grupos sociales: Chinchiná y Palestina para los recolectores del café en épocas de cosecha y Riosucio y Salamina para el caso de los campesinos.

T1  - Factors influencing extent of traceability along organic fresh produce value chains: case of kale in Nairobi, Kenya
AN  - 1938604395
AB  - Information asymmetry is often a characteristic present in food value chains. However, high information asymmetry reduces trust and may compromise food safety and quality. Traceability enhances information sharing and disclosure thereby reducing the imperfection. Qualitative and quantitative data was collected from Kenyan certified farmers and organic outlets to generate empirical information on the extent and factors that contribute to traceability along organic kale value chains. Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics and factor analysis. Majority (62 %) of smallholder producers had a functional traceability system. Factor analysis revealed that organizational activities and personnel perception contribute to traceability in an organization. Variables that contribute to organizational activities are documentation/record keeping (0.754), certification by other quality management standards (0.711), training on food safety and traceability management (0.444) and system monitoring (0.770). Such knowledge can be used by players along the value chain to reduce information asymmetry. The results suggest need for awareness creation among stakeholders on how organizational activities can be used to improve traceability through enhanced information flow for safer and better quality organic products. In addition, perception of personnel which plays an important role in traceability can be improved through training personnel on beneficial consequences of a traceability system.

T1  - Diversity amongst farm households and achievements from multi-stakeholder innovation platform approach: lessons from Balaka Malawi
AN  - 1935039344
AB  - Background 
Understanding diversity of smallholder farm households is of critical importance for the success of development interventions. Farming households often will devise livelihood strategies that provide the best guarantee for survival and based on their socioeconomic vulnerability. This study examines how achievements from the Integrated Agricultural Research for Development (IAR4D) approach through participation in innovation platform activities accrue to smallholder farming households of diverse socioeconomic status. The study is based on a representative sample of smallholder farmers from Balaka innovation platform found in Balaka district of Malawi. Balaka innovation platform was formed in 2009 with the aim of addressing key farmer problems of low crop productivity, lack of input and output markets, limited access to agricultural credit, low incomes and poverty in general. Through multi-stakeholder dialogue, the platform proposed activities meant to improve livelihoods of participants. Some of the activities include conservation agriculture adoption, crop diversification, improved communication through the platform, linking farmers to microfinance institutions and markets, collective market participation, joining farmer groups organised by the platform and various other activities. The main aim was to improve crop productivity, household incomes and food security. 
Results 
A multivariate study that combines principal component analysis for essential data reduction and cluster analysis to classify typical farm households based on their socioeconomic characteristics and reported achievements from innovation platform activities was used. It is evident from the results that achievements from innovation platform activities are not uniform across farmer groups of different socioeconomic status. 
Conclusions 
The upshots call for segregated approaches in promoting adoption of various livelihood improving activities, technologies and approaches through the innovation platform approach in smallholder farming areas such as the ones in Balaka, Malawi. Tactics selected by development partners to fight against smallholder farmer problems of low productivity low incomes and food insecurity should conform to farmer socioeconomic vulnerability for greater success.

T1  - Men and women farmers perceptions of adopting improved diets for pigs in Uganda: decision-making, income allocation, and intra-household strategies that mitigate relative disadvantage
AN  - 1915636529
AB  - Background 
The roles and responsibilities of men and women in east African smallholder pig-raising households and the entitlements each can claim from pig-enterprise income are unknown. The article is a qualitative gender-and-household-head-disaggregated exploration of Ugandan smallholder pig farmers’ perceptions. Asset ownership, control, and access; division of labour; and decision-making related to pig rearing and pig-enterprise income are presented in the context of the potential impact of adopting improved diets for pigs (a productivity improvement). 
Results 
Potential benefits of improved diet adoption included faster pig growth; increased farmer income and pig population; new on-farm employment and produce market opportunities; and improved pig market opportunities and family- and community-level well-being. Contradictory views about the potential impact of diet adoption on labour requirements and feed costs, and the inclusion of seasonal, home-grown ingredients were expressed. Concerns about people and pigs competing for food and personal safety were also voiced. Women allocated pig-enterprise income to provide for their children, household, and extended family, and spent only the remaining income on themselves. Men allocated income to meet personal needs, and to provide for their children, wife, second wife/family, extended family, and lovers. Men and women in female-headed households (WFHH) had overt decision-making ability over the pig enterprise and pig-enterprise income. Some women in male-headed households (WMHH) had overt decision-making ability over the pig enterprise and pig-enterprise income when their husband allowed it, or failed to provide, or was away. Pig ownership and labour investment by WMHH did not guarantee that women had decision-making ability or benefitted from pig-enterprise income. Some WMHH employed covert strategies which mitigated their relative disadvantage. Threat of domestic violence inhibited the decision-making ability of WMHH. Polygyny reduced intra-household communication transparency. 
Conclusions 
Diet adoption could benefit smallholder pig-raising households and farming communities, but lack of funds and human/pig food competition could limit adoption. Men, WFHH, and some WMHH had overt decision-making ability over the pig enterprise and pig-enterprise income. Men allocated income to benefit themselves, and their multiple families and lovers. Women allocated income to benefit their families and spent only surplus income on themselves. Women employed covert strategies to mitigate their relative disadvantage.

T1  - Value chain development for mango (Mangifera indica) around Outamba Kilimi National Park in Sierra Leone: constraints and opportunities for smallholders
AN  - 1905523945
AB  - Background 
Mango is an important tree fruit in Sierra Leone since it participates to food and nutritional security mainly in rural areas. However, the economic potential of this tree fruit is still untapped to a large extent. This situation is due to high loss and poor handling at post-harvest stage preventing farmers from meeting the quality standard for different markets. The aims of this paper were to analyse the constrains and opportunities for mango value chain development, as well as community-based copping strategies developed by chain actors to valorise the existing opportunities for better market development and forest conservation. 
Methods 
Data were collected in four sites around the Outamba Kilimi National Park, Sierra Leone, through focus group discussions with men and women groups of 25-35 mango value chain actors in each site. 
Results 
Results indicated that mango value chain is composed of nursery suppliers, mango producers, harvesters and assemblers, processors and traders. Main constraints encountered by both men and women are lack of: (1) polythene bags and improved mango seedlings, mineral fertilisers, herbicides, pesticide, (2) training on appropriate mango production practices, (3) appropriate harvesting tools, (4) appropriate processing knowledge and equipment, as well as high transportation cost. Hand weeding, use of available organic fertiliser, seeking of advices from colleagues farmers, equipment from other processors who own local processing equipment were some of the coping strategies developed by various actors along mango value chains. Soil fertility, favourable climatic conditions, technical and financial support from direct or indirect actors through training on good agronomic practices, processing and marketing techniques, availability of hired labour to perform farming and processing operations, existence of local processing plant to serve as outlet for fresh mango were identified as main factors to be exploited to improve mango value chains around Outamba Kilimi National Park in Sierra Leone. 
Conclusions 
Our results provided insight into the various factors limiting the performance of mango value chains around Outamba Kilimi National Park in Sierra Leone. This baseline study will help in designing and implementing appropriate strategies to promote mango value chains in the areas around the Outamba Kilimi National Park.

T1  - Peru: agroecological movement history 1980-2015
AN  - 1891114494
AB  - The Peruvian agroecological movement has been strongly shaped by civil society organizations, organized ecological small farmers, market opportunities, academia, and key political advocacy actions. Collectively organized responses with a high degree of self-learning have encouraged a favorable regulatory framework for organic farming, the valuation of our biodiversity, and the recognition of small-scale farmers as a key source of local food. The agroecological movement has grown in learning, organization, and social impact while facing new challenges that need to be solved.

T1  - Costs of Lost opportunities: Applying Non-Market Valuation Techniques to Potential REDD+ Participants in Cameroon
AN  - 1888945720
AB  - Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has been systematically advanced within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, implementing REDD+ in a populated landscape requires information on local costs and acceptability of changed practices. To supply such information, many studies have adopted approaches that explore the opportunity cost of maintaining land as forest rather than converting it to agricultural uses. These approaches typically assume that the costs to the smallholder are borne exclusively through the loss or gain of the production values associated with specific categories of land use. However, evaluating the value of land to smallholders in incomplete and messy institutional and economic contexts entails other considerations, such as varying portfolios of land holdings, tenure arrangements, restricted access to capital, and unreliable food markets. We suggest that contingent valuation (CV) methods may provide a more complete reflection of the viability of REDD+ in multiple-use landscapes than do opportunity cost approaches. The CV approach eliminates the need to assume a homogenous smallholder, and instead assumes heterogeneity around social, economic and institutional contexts. We apply this approach in a southern rural Cameroonian context, through the lens of a hypothetical REDD+ contract. Our findings suggest local costs of REDD+ contracts to be higher and much more variable than opportunity cost estimates.

T1  - The impact of adoption of conservation agriculture on smallholder farmers food security in semi-arid zones of southern Africa
AN  - 1883864309
AB  - Background 
In southern Africa, conservation agriculture (CA) has received a lot of research and promotional support from various organizations in the past decades. Conservation agriculture is largely promoted as one of the few win-win technologies affordable to farmers, in the sense that potentially it improves farmers’ yields (in the long term) at the same time conserving the environment. This is because conservation agriculture reduces nitrogen loss in the soil, promotes water and soil conservation and improves agronomic use efficiency of applied nutrients. However, some concerns have been raised over the feasibility of conservation agriculture on smallholder farms given constraints imposed by the biophysical and institutional realities under which smallholder farmers operate. The main aim of this study is to answer the question whether conservation agriculture is resulting in tangible livelihood outcomes to smallholder farmers. The counterfactual outcome approach was used to estimate ex post impact of conservation agriculture adoption on one of the key livelihood outcomes-food security. 
Results 
The study that utilized a data set covering 1623 households in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique found no significant impact of conservation agriculture adoption on Food Consumption Score of farmers in Zimbabwe and Malawi. Possible reasons for the insignificant of CA impact on food security in Zimbabwe and Malawi could include the small land areas currently devoted to CA, and the failure to implement the full complement of practices necessary to set off the biophysical process that are expected to drive yield increases. In Mozambique, conservation agriculture significantly improved the Food Consumption Score for farmers exposed to the technology. A possible reason for effectiveness of CA in Mozambique could be due to the fact that often CA is being promoted together with other better cropping management practices such as timely weeding and improved seed varieties, which are poorly practiced by the generality of farmers in a country just emerging from a war period. 
Conclusion 
This paper provides one of the few ex post assessments of the impact of conservation agriculture adoption on household livelihood outcomes-food security. Given the mixed findings, the study suggests that conservation agriculture farmers in the three countries need to be supported to adopt a value chain approach to conservation agriculture. This entails the introduction of commercial or high-value crops in the conservation agriculture programmes, value addition on farmers produce, access to the necessary support services such as markets for seed, fertilizer, herbicides and equipment as well as reliable extension. We believe that under such circumstances conservation agriculture can effectively reduce food insecurity and poverty in the medium to long term.

T1  - Characterization of pre- and postharvest losses of tomato supply chain in Ethiopia
AN  - 1883823041
AB  - Background 
Tomato has significant economic importance in Ethiopia. Although quantitative evidence is limited, postharvest loss in tomato is considerably high. This study presents qualitative and quantitative postharvest losses of tomato. The study was conducted in 2015 in two districts (Bora and Dugda) located in East Shewa Zone of Oromia National Regional State, Ethiopia, located southeast of Addis Ababa. Primary data were collected from producers (smallholder farmers) and traders via household survey, focus group discussions and key informant interviews as well as estimation of losses based on samples. Secondary data and information were collected from published and unpublished sources. 
Results 
Results indicate that tomato production is being done by relatively young married individuals who have at least primary level education. About three-quarter of land holding is allocated for vegetable production, which largely takes place under irrigation during dry season. All sample producers sold more than 95% of their tomato produce, mostly to wholesalers as compared to collectors and retailers. Postharvest losses occur at collectors, wholesalers and retailers level. The finding indicates that more than 16% of respondents encounter produce losses due to high incidence of diseases, insect pest and mechanical injuries, each of them accounting for more than 20% of postharvest losses. 
Conclusions 
The findings from our study underscore that the ability of actors to mitigate postharvest losses is limited due to lack of technical know-how. They also lack necessary support and complementary resources to improve postharvest handling practices and technology.

T1  - The role of community engagement in the adoption of new agricultural biotechnologies by farmers: the case of the Africa harvest tissue-culture banana in Kenya
AN  - 1882902791
AB  - Background 
The tissue culture banana (TCB) is a biotechnological agricultural innovation that has been adopted widely in commercial banana production. In 2003, Africa Harvest Biotech Foundation International (AH) initiated a TCB program that was explicitly developed for smallholder farmers in Kenya to help them adopt the TCB as a scalable agricultural business opportunity. At the heart of the challenge of encouraging more widespread adoption of the TCB is the question: what is the best way to introduce the TCB technology, and all its attendant practices and opportunities, to smallholder farmers. In essence, a challenge of community or stakeholder engagement (CE). 
Results 
In this paper, we report the results of a case study of the CE strategies employed by AH to introduce TCB agricultural practices to small-hold farmers in Kenya, and their impact on the uptake of the TCB, and on the nature of the relationship between AH and the relevant community of farmers and other stakeholders. We identified six specific features of CE in the AH TCB project that were critical to its effectiveness: (1) adopting an empirical, “evidence-based” approach; (2) building on existing social networks; (3) facilitating farmer-to-farmer engagement; (4) focusing engagement on farmer groups; (5) strengthening relationships of trust through collaborative experiential learning; and (6) helping farmers to “learn the marketing game”. We discuss the implications of AH’s “values-based” approach to engagement, and how these guiding values functioned as “design constraints” for the key features of their CE strategy. And we highlight the importance of attention to the human dimensions of complex partnerships as a key determinant of successful CE. 
Conclusion 
Our findings suggest new ways of conceptualizing the relationship between CE and the design and delivery of new technologies for global health and global development.

T1  - Food safety in Vietnam: where we are at and what we can learn from international experiences
AN  - 1874369466
AB  - Food-borne diseases are attracting a lot of attention in Vietnam as a result of repeated episodes of adulterated and unsafe food. In this paper, we provide some perspectives on food safety in Vietnam from the point of view of an international research institution working on food safety with partners in the country. We argue that one of the key issues of food safety in Vietnam is that certain food value chain stakeholders lack ethics, which leads to the production and trading of unsafe foods in order to make profits irrespective of adverse health effects on consumers. In turn, the shortfall in ethical behaviours around food can be attributed to a lack of incentives or motivating factors.

              
Although food safety causes panic in the population, it is unclear how much contaminated food contributes to the burden of food-borne diseases and food poisonings in Vietnam. However, globally, the biggest health problem associated with food are infections from consuming food contaminated with viruses, bacteria or parasites. A major food safety challenge is the inappropriate way of communicating food risks to the public. Another key constraint is the inherent difficulty in managing food in wet markets and from smallholder production. On the other hand, local foods, and local food production and processing are an important cultural asset as well as being essential to food safety, and these aspects can be put at risk if food safety concerns motivate consumers to purchase more imported foods.

              
In this paper, we also discuss good experiences in food safety management from other countries and draw lessons learnt for Vietnam on how to better deal with the current food safety situation.

T1  - Assessing and managing intensification in smallholder dairy systems for food and nutrition security in Sub-Saharan Africa
AN  - 1841971552
AB  - Smallholder farmers play an important part in the dairy value chain in Sub-Saharan Africa. Three technological approaches have been used to improve productivity. These are through, applying agricultural ecological processes (ecological intensification), utilising modern livestock breeding (genetic intensification), and socio-economic intensification. Ecological intensification includes continuous housing of cows applying a cut-and-carry feeding system, introduction of purpose-bred forages and pastures, and the introduction of agro-forestry within the dairy systems. Genetic intensification strategies include: importation of dairy breeds such as Holstein-Friesian (HF) and cross-breeding of the indigenous breeds with HF. Training and capacity-building activities to create sustainable livelihoods have been initiated for farming and technological practices of animal husbandry, but also to enhance appropriate leadership and corporative-building skills that would create and support an enabling environment for sustainability. These improvements and initiatives in the service delivery have been championed by national governments, development partner institutions, or non-governmental organisations through different programmes. Challenges of intensification include matching management to genetic potential of imported and cross-bred improved dairy breeds, ensuring low post-harvest losses, proper utilisation, and reducing environmental impact. Using examples from Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia, this paper reviews the management and assessment approaches used in fostering smallholder dairy development strategies and dairy's contribution to sustainable livelihoods in the face of intensification.

T1  - Food access and pro-poor value chains: a community case study in the central highlands of Peru
AN  - 1837537586
AB  - Pro-poor value chains intend to integrate smallholding farmers into high value markets to contribute to poverty alleviation and food security. Although income benefits of pro-poor value chains have been found, scant evidence exists regarding the potential for these markets to enhance food security. This study focuses on components of food access--dietary diversity, physical and financial access, and social acceptability--among households that participate in pro-poor value chains and non-participating households in the central highlands of Peru where development interventions have created high value market niches for the native potato varieties that smallholding farmers have conserved for thousands of years. Using a mixed methods approach, this study assessed dietary diversity among households that participate and do not participate in pro-poor value chains, as well as their perceptions of their food access. Findings indicated that households that participate in value chains have higher dietary diversity than non-participating households but that these differences are likely due to pre-existing differences in socioeconomic status rather than any causal effect provided by value chains. The study also concluded that while participation in pro-poor value chains sometimes enhance the purchasing power of participating households, they may also weaken financial access, important for both purchasing food and travel to make those purchases. Community perspectives also indicated concerns with the acceptability of diets, which cannot likely be comprehensively addressed by pro-poor value chains. Collectively, the findings from this study cast doubt on the assumption that a linear flow exists between pro-poor value chains and enhanced food access.

T1  - Climate change adaptation options in rainfed upland cropping systems in the wet tropics: A case study of smallholder farms in North-West Cambodia
AN  - 1835031640; 4761000
AB  - While climate change is confirmed to have serious impacts on agricultural production in many regions worldwide, researchers have proposed various measures that farmers can apply to cope with and adapt to those changes. However, it is often the case that not every adaptation measure would be practical and adoptable in a specific region. Farmers may have their own ways of managing and adapting to climate change that need to be taken into account when considering interventions. This study aimed to engage with farmers to: (1) better understand small-holder knowledge, attitudes and practices in relation to perceived or expected climate change; and (2) document cropping practices, climate change perceptions, constraints to crop production, and coping and adaptation options with existing climate variability and expected climate change. This study was conducted in 2015 in Sala Krau village near Pailin (12°52'N, 102°45'E) and Samlout (12°39'N, 102°36'E) of North-West Cambodia. The methods used were a combination of focus group discussions and one-on-one interviews where 132 farming households were randomly selected. We found that farmers were conscious of changes in climate over recent years, and had a good understanding of likely future changes. While farmers are aware of some practices that can be modified to minimize risk and cope with anticipated changes, they are reluctant to apply them. Furthermore; there are no government agricultural extension services provided at the village level and farmers have relied on each other and other actors in the value chain network for information to support their decision-making. There is a lack of knowledge of the principles of conservation agriculture that urgently require agricultural extension services in the region to build farmer ability to better cope and adapt to climate change.

T1  - The political economy of agriculture for development today: the "small versus large" scale debate revisited
AN  - 1832894952
AB  - The role of agriculture in economic development and the development politics of promoting smallholder versus large-scale agriculture have both been at the center of a long-lasting and controversial debate. Using an innovative methodology which combines a value chain approach with input-output-analysis, the growth multipliers and productivity of both farm types in Guatemala are analyzed. Results show that smallholder agriculture has the same potential to stimulate output growth as large-scale agriculture. Smallholder value chains include mainly informal sectors and create more jobs than commercial agriculture. Therefore, a reorientation of agricultural and land policies toward small-scale food producers and within a comprehensive policy of integrated rural development is not only necessary in terms of social equity but also for boosting economic development.

T1  - Climate change adaptation options in rainfed upland cropping systems in the wet tropics: A case study of smallholder farms in North-West Cambodia
AN  - 1822062062
AB  - While climate change is confirmed to have serious impacts on agricultural production in many regions worldwide, researchers have proposed various measures that farmers can apply to cope with and adapt to those changes. However, it is often the case that not every adaptation measure would be practical and adoptable in a specific region. Farmers may have their own ways of managing and adapting to climate change that need to be taken into account when considering interventions. This study aimed to engage with farmers to: (1) better understand small-holder knowledge, attitudes and practices in relation to perceived or expected climate change; and (2) document cropping practices, climate change perceptions, constraints to crop production, and coping and adaptation options with existing climate variability and expected climate change. This study was conducted in 2015 in Sala Krau village near Pailin (12°52'N, 102°45'E) and Samlout (12°39'N, 102°36'E) of North-West Cambodia. The methods used were a combination of focus group discussions and one-on-one interviews where 132 farming households were randomly selected. We found that farmers were conscious of changes in climate over recent years, and had a good understanding of likely future changes. While farmers are aware of some practices that can be modified to minimize risk and cope with anticipated changes, they are reluctant to apply them. Furthermore; there are no government agricultural extension services provided at the village level and farmers have relied on each other and other actors in the value chain network for information to support their decision-making. There is a lack of knowledge of the principles of conservation agriculture that urgently require agricultural extension services in the region to build farmer ability to better cope and adapt to climate change.

T1  - Contractual Farming Arrangements, Quality Control, Incentives, and Distribution Failure in Kenya's Smallholder Horticulture: A Multivariate Probit Analysis
AN  - 1831052798
AB  - With the rapid growth of horticultural value chains, the use of contractual farming arrangements, strategies of quality control (farm audits/crop rejections), pricing incentives, and distribution efficiencies (crop collection arrangements) are increasingly breaking market barriers, for example, private standards, certification, traceability, and supply reliability in developing countries. Cognizant of market access, farm produce value, sustainable production, and reduction of postharvest losses, this paper investigated whether farm size, schooling, producer price, farm visits, and social capital networks condition these strategies. The results show that use of written contracts is conditioned by farm sizes, more extension, and number of producer groups (PGs) while farm certification is positively predicted by farm sizes, more extension, number of sellers in the village and seasons with the same buyer. However, certification is less responsive to producer prices. Crop rejections are predicted to be less depending on a farmer's education, number of PGs, and the producer price but are more likely to increase the more the number of sellers. Further, the results show that a forward pricing incentive is highly correlated with higher producer prices, more extension, and number of seasons with the same buyer. Finally, uncollected produce at harvest is likely to decrease with farm sizes, more education and extension, higher producer price, number of PGs, and seasons with the same buyer but is more likely to increase the higher the number of sellers. Implications are made. [EconLit citations: L14; Q13].

T1  - Influence of voluntary coffee certifications on cooperatives' advisory services and agricultural practices of smallholder farmers in Costa Rica
AN  - 1830063583
AB  - Purpose: This article explores how voluntary certifications influence the way cooperatives provide advisory services to their members and the influence of these services on agricultural practices. Design/Methodology/Approach: Case studies were conducted in four representative Costa Rican cooperatives interviewing twenty interviewed cooperative administrators and members to determine changes in advisory services and farming practices over the past twenty years and factors which influenced those changes. Findings: Certifications induce cooperatives to offer new services to support farmers. Cooperatives form collaborations with new stakeholders or reconfigure existing collaborations to provide advisory services to their members. These services have helped to shape farmers' attitudes about sustainable farming practices, though farm-level changes may be small. The main change at the cooperative level is adding new topics for group training, and certification issues are directly linked with practices such as maintaining a farm record book or wearing a mask when applying pesticides. Practices which compete with productivity are unlikely to change. Practical Implications: The results are useful to improve the advisory services provided by cooperatives by better identifying the key issues to be addressed to fulfill the certifications' requirements. Theoretical implications: Cooperatives are a relevant player to induce more sustainable practices, by providing or coordinating advisory services, but their efforts cannot be seen disconnected from a broader institutional environment. Originality/Value: We demonstrate that certifications change the intensity and scope of advisory services and induce cooperatives to engage with a more diverse network of stakeholders.

T1  - Benefit-Cost Analysis of Foot and Mouth Disease Control in Large Ruminants in Cambodia
AN  - 1816571670
AB  - Summary              Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in Cambodia and throughout the Greater Mekong Subregion and causes significant losses to rural smallholders owning the majority of the national large ruminant population. However, due to underreporting, paucity of knowledge of FMD impacts, limited veterinary capacity and deficits of data available for analysis, the quantifiable benefits of a national FMD control programme are unknown. To address this deficit, existing literature and research data from the 'Best practice health and husbandry of cattle, Cambodia' project conducted between 2007 and 2012, were used to develop a three-phase analysis framework to: assess the impacts of the recent widespread FMD epizootic in Cambodia in 2010, conduct a value chain analysis of the large ruminant market and estimate the costs and benefits for a national large ruminant biannual FMD vaccination programme. A trader survey conducted in 2010-2011 provided cattle and buffalo value chain information and was matched to village herd structure data to calculate a total large ruminant farm-gate value of USD 1.271 billion in 2010. Monte Carlo simulation modelling that implemented a 5-year biannual vaccination programme at a cost of USD 6.3 an animal per year identified a benefit-cost ratio of 1.40 (95% CI 0.96-2.20) when accounting for recent prices of cattle and buffalo in Cambodia and based on an expected annual incidence of 0.2 (assuming one major epizootic in the 5-year vaccination programme). Given that the majority of the large ruminants are owned by rural smallholders, and mostly the poor are involved in agricultural employment, the successful implementation of an FMD control programme in Cambodia would be expected to avoid estimated losses of USD 135 million; equivalent to 10.6% of the 2010 farm-gate value and contributing to important reductions in rural poverty and food insecurity.

T1  - Analysing challenges facing smallholder farmers and conservation agriculture in South Africa: A system dynamics approach
AN  - 1877441344
AB  - Smallholder farmers in South Africa find it challenging to participate in the modern economy. Most of these farmers have limited access to credit and insurance, and to markets in which to sell their produce. This paper reviews ethnographic research data and argues that smallholder farmers struggle to take part in modern agricultural value chains in South Africa. System dynamics modelling is used to understand the dynamics relating to agricultural value-chain participants, and to determine whether the ethnographic research data is sufficient to answer the question as to which value-chain participants potentially have the largest impact on smallholder farmers. The modelling results show that banks may have the potential to trigger an impact on smallholder farmers' productivity that could then attract other value-chain industries to take part in efforts to support these farmers. Smallholder farmers could become a long-term viable and sustainable option for increasing food security in South Africa. However, this study has its limitations. The data used from existing ethnographic research, conducted by way of semi-structured interviews with valuechain participants, is limited and is not able to answer questions such as: (i) how much each industry is prepared to engage with smallholder farmers in the event of other industries being prepared to do the same; and (ii) how long it will take each industry to react to a willingness to engage. Ongoing research is required to extend the interviewee base and data in order to answer these questions and for the model to be completed and used for policy guidance.

T1  - "Feed Assist"- An Expert System on Balanced Feeding for Dairy Animals
AN  - 1860284387
AB  - Inadequate feeding is the major factor for low livestock productivity in India. In dairying, feed cost is a major input and feeding practices has to be improved to ensure profits. Still the small scale farmers are following traditional feeding practices and fail to address the complexities involved in ration formulation. To address the complexities in ration balancing based on the nutrient requirements for different categories of livestock, nutrient composition of wide range of feed resources and the cost - a number of expert systems have been developed. However existing expert systems have not been widely used by majority of small farmers due to lack of awareness, access and basic skills required to operate. To address these limitations, "Feed Assist" a farmer friendly expert system for balanced feeding of dairy animals at least cost has been developed using linear programming. "Feed Assist" does not require much expertise to operate and enables the farmers to formulate least cost rations for different categories of livestock using locally available feed resources.

T1  - Food Safety Perceptions and Practices among Smallholder Pork Value Chain Actors in Hung Yen Province, Vietnam
AN  - 1815510957
AB  - Pork safety is an important public health concern in Vietnam and is a shared responsibility among many actors along the pork value chain. We examined the knowledge, perceptions, and practices regarding food safety, disease, and health risk among selected pork value chain actors (slaughterhouse owners and workers, people living around slaughterhouses, pork sellers, consumers, and veterinary and public health staff) in three districts in Hung Yen Province, Vietnam. We randomly selected 52 pork value chain actors to be surveyed through questionnaires, observation checklists, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions. Most slaughterhouse workers acquired knowledge and experience of food safety through "learning by doing" rather than from training by a veterinary or public health professional. Both slaughterhouse worker and pork seller groups had some accurate perceptions about pig diseases and foodborne diseases; however, misperceptions of risk and, especially, of zoonoses were present. Furthermore, while workers and sellers often use cloths to dry the meat and clean equipment, they did not think this was a risk for meat contamination. Moreover, when sellers wear protective equipment, such as gloves, masks, or hats, consumers perceive that the sellers may have health issues they are trying to conceal and so consumers avoid buying from them. The perceived freshness of pork, along with trust in the seller and in the pork production process, were strong indicators of consumer preference. And yet, pork value chain actors tend to trust their own individual food safety practices more, rather than the practices of other actors along the chain. Veterinary and public health staff emphasized the gap between regulations and food safety practices. Education and training on food safety risks and proper handling are priorities, along with integrated and intensive efforts to improve food safety among pork value chain actors.

T1  - Cotton and textiles industries in Tanzania: the failures of liberalisation
AN  - 1815349183
AB  - This article uses the story of cotton cultivation in Tanzania to analyse critically the processes of liberalisation and expose the failure of markets to reward quality production. It starts by summarising the technological requirements to grow the crop. It then shows how cotton was central to industrialisation, in Britain and elsewhere. In Tanzania, cotton is grown on small farms and so the article then summarises how small farmers make choices and minimise risks. This creates the context for outline histories, first of cotton growing, and then of textile industries in Tanzania, before turning to the impact of structural adjustment and liberalisation in the late 1980s and 1990s which led to increases in production but losses in quality and price. The article draws conclusions from this about the role of agriculture in processes of economic transformation and the need for institutions which represent the economic interests of small farmers.

T1  - Rural Finance and Agricultural Technology Adoption in Ethiopia: Does the Institutional Design of Lending Organizations Matter?
AN  - 1791358385
AB  - It has now become almost a stylized fact that sustained agricultural growth is central to rapid poverty reduction and economic development. Yet, world poverty is largely concentrated in the agrarian societies, which have the potential for agricultural productivity growth. This is particularly true for Sub-Saharan African countries, where the gaps between potential and actual yields remain high. Minimizing this gap through the promotion of modern inputs -- such as fertilizer and modern seeds -- has been at the core of almost all development strategies in Ethiopia. Among other initiatives, the country has promoted microfinance institutions and member-owned financial cooperatives to alleviate credit constraints of the smallholder farmers. This paper analyzes the impacts of these institutions. Using household survey data and a propensity-score-matching technique, we examine the effects that institutional financial services have on farmers' adoption of agricultural technology in Ethiopia. The results suggest that access to institutional finance has a significant positive impact on both the adoption and extent of technology use. However, when impacts are disaggregated by type of financial institution and farm size, heterogeneities are observed. In particular, financial cooperatives have a greater impact on technology adoption than microfinance institutions, and the results appear to vary depending on farm size and types of inputs. The paper concludes with implications for policies to promote adoption of modern agricultural inputs. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X16000449]

T1  - Aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> and Deoxynivalenol contamination of dairy feeds and presence of Aflatoxin M<sub>1</sub> contamination in milk from smallholder dairy systems in Nakuru, Kenya
AN  - 1987927350
AB  - BackgroundMycotoxins are metabolites produced by phytopathogenic and spoilage fungi in animal feed as a result of poor storage. The mycotoxins can also originate in the field and are excreted in milk when dairy animals consume such feeds, posing a public health risk concern.MethodsThe aim of this study was to conduct a risk assessment in the informal sub-value chains of rural and peri-urban dairy systems in Nakuru County, by determining the prevalence and quantity levels of mycotoxins in animal feeds and milk. A total of 74 animal feed samples and 120 milk samples were simultaneously collected from individual cows and actors in the informal dairy value chain. Feed samples were analyzed for Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and Deoxynivalenol (DON) while milk samples were analyzed for Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) using commercial Enzyme Linked Immune Sorbent Assay (ELISA) method.ResultsAflatoxin B1 contamination levels in 56 % (41/74) of the animal feeds exceeded the European Union (EU) limits of 5 μg/kg ranging between 0 and 147.86 μg/kg. Deoxynivalenol (DON) was identified in 63 % (27/43) of all the animal feeds ranging between 0 and 179.89 μg/kg. In the peri-urban dairy system, 48.5 % (33/68) of the milk samples were contaminated with the AFM1 concentration above the EU regulation of 0.05 μg/L ranging between 0.017 and 0.083 μg/L. All milk samples from the rural dairy system had AFM1 contamination levels below the EU limits of 0.05 μg/L ranging between 0 and 0.041 μg/L. Linear regression model showed significant association of abiotic factors; pH, water activity and moisture content of animal feed with AFB1 and DON contamination of the animal feeds.ConclusionsThe results obtained from this study indicate that the peri-urban dairy farms, where intensive management predominate face the challenge of quality feeds, and one contributing factor is the on-farm production and handling of animal feeds.

T1  - FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT FOCUS ON 'COLD' MONEY VIA CONVENTIONAL FINANCING METHODS VERSUS 'HOT' MONEY FLOW THROUGH INFORMAL FINANCING METHODS : CASE STUDIES
AN  - 1896359803
AB  - Under the Group-scheme operated by the Small Farmers Development Programme (SFDP) in Nepal, the circumstances in which the Group Organizer (GO) is expected to carry out the 'pre-investment survey' preclude him from obtaining any meaningful data on farmers incomes. The country's (Sri Lanka) financial system is fuelled on two types of funds : "hot" and "cold" money, 'cold' money is that which comes from the State, and is often thought of as a real or potential subsidy. Loans from 'hot' money are derived from cooperative members, savings and must, therefore, be handled carefully. Though it is an established fact that agricultural producers and cooperative members are eligible to have access to two capital markets - - institutional (through banking channels on conventional terms based on commercial considerations) and informal (through Isusu Trust Societies, etc., on non-conventional terms based on welfare motive) - - in reality, developing countries plagued with many economic difficulties and resultant financial problems find it very difficult to have access to institutional (conventional) financing ('cold' money) facilities and are forced by circumstances to resort to informal financing institutions for easy 'hot' money flow. The author after detailed research study has proposed a financial management model to handle the issue of informal financing ('hot' money flow) through the proposed Isusu and Trust Society for executives in Nigeria.

T1  - Impact of contracts in high yielding varieties seed production on profits and yield: The case of Nepal
AN  - 1806430378
AB  - Nepal's population continues to grow, but the agricultural sector's performance remains almost stagnant. This has led to a decline in the per capita availability of food. Increasing agricultural productivity is the key to agricultural growth, and one strategy for increasing agricultural productivity is to use improved seeds. This study investigates the impact of contract farming (CF) in high yielding varieties (HYV) of paddy seed production on costs, yield, and profits of smallholder farms in Nepal. Using farm-level data and a non-parametric propensity score matching estimator, the study finds a significant positive impact of contract HYV seed farming on revenues, profits, and yield, and a significant negative impact on total costs of production. Additionally, very small farms (?0.43 ha) with CF in HYV paddy seeds tend to gain the most when it comes to yield per hectare. Our estimates reveal that the average smallholder household in Nepal engaged in CF with input conditions receives higher profits. However, farmers engaged in CF with output conditions tend to have higher yields but smaller profits. Finally, farmers engaged in CF in HYV paddy seeds with both input and output conditions have the highest yield gains and significantly higher profits.

T1  - Building Sustainable Smallholder Cooperatives in Emerging Market Economies: Findings from a Five-Year Project in Kenya
AN  - 1803946470
AB  - A comparative study of two smallholder dairy cooperatives in Kenya examines the question: what factors are conducive to producing sustainable smallholder cooperatives that can gain entry into the vertical value chain in liberalized post-colonial economies? The relative weight of income advantage; selective individual incentives and, social capital on maintaining member patronage are assessed within variable environmental constraints and opportunities facing different cooperatives. The methodology includes case study observation of the cooperatives during a five-year period, as well as sample surveys of members and non-members that include indicators of dairy income; reasons why farmers elect to join or not join the cooperative; and assessments of the importance of different services provided by the cooperative. The findings show how the relative weight of specific incentives for cooperative membership can vary from one environment to another within the same nation. The most important finding is that maintaining sustainable smallholder cooperatives within an increasingly competitive environment depends on the ability of managers to create business strategies that are compatible with the cooperative's environmental constraints but, at the same time, incentivize members' patronage.

T1  - ORGANIC PINEAPPLE FARMING IN GHANA - A GOOD CHOICE FOR SMALLHOLDERS?
AN  - 1801554211
AB  - The growth of organic food and drinks sector, higher than that of the conventional market, creates niche market opportunities mainly in developed countries. Organic certification is promoted in developing countries as a valuable export alternative, as well as a solution to environmental and health problems related to chemical input use. Organic products earn a premium price on the international market compared to conventional products. Hence, shifting from conventional to organic production might be an opportunity for small-scale farmers to reap high returns from their investments. Since switching to organic production requires adjustments of production techniques as well as the costs of the certification itself, several aspects need to be considered when determining its profitability. Using the pineapple sector in Ghana as an example, this paper sheds light on the feasibility and profitability of organic small-scale production. The literature so far has looked income effects on small scale farmers and price premia at consumer level. We provide the missing link between these papers by showing how the premium for organic produce at the farm level is formed, how it translates into profits and how it develops along the value chain. In doing so, the paper also has to set a focus to the specific conditions in Ghana, where the pineapple industry, once flourishing, has faced a crisis after 2005. With regard to donor efforts to bring back smallholders into export production, it is central to know if this is a viable possibility in Ghana. Analyzing costs and price formation along the fresh pineapple value chain, we find that production for the export market is a realistic option for both organic and conventional small-scale pineapple farmers. Second, the results suggest a positive effect of switching from conventional to organic production when competing on the global market for pineapple. Among smallholder farms, organic production is more advantageous than conventional production. Our findings also suggest that a considerable share of the organic price premium is passed from retail level to Ghanaian farmers. Nevertheless, other factors such as contract enforcement costs and standard compliance may hinder farmers from successfully participating in export markets.

T1  - Sugarcane Outgrowers in Ethiopia: "Forced" to Remain Poor?
AN  - 1784560156
AB  - Contract farming is often seen as a panacea for many of the challenges faced by agricultural production in developing countries. Given the large heterogeneity of contract farming arrangements, it is debatable whether all kinds of contract farming arrangements offer benefits to participating smallholders. Nonetheless, many donor agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and governments of developing countries are increasingly pushing for contract farming and outgrower schemes as an instrument to commercialize small-scale farming. Their desire for such arrangements is further reinforced by the recent rush for large-scale agricultural land acquisition in most developing countries, often described as "land grabbing," because contract farming and outgrower schemes can result in the same advantages as large-scale farming, but avoid its main drawback -- namely the displacement of the current land-users. Using data from the oldest and some more recently established sugarcane outgrower schemes in Ethiopia, this paper examines the effects of compulsory participation in sugarcane outgrower production on total household income and asset stocks. Because outgrowers and non-outgrowers may have some differences prior to joining sugarcane outgrower schemes, we use genetic matching and propensity score matching to make the two groups comparable based on their observable characteristics. Our results indicate that compulsory participation in an outgrower scheme significantly reduces the income and asset stocks of outgrowers who contributed irrigated land to the outgrower scheme, while the effect is insignificant for outgrowers who contributed rain-fed land. We provide several explanations and discuss policy implications. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X16000437]

T1  - Impact of an Agricultural Value Chain Project on Smallholder Farmers, Households, and Children in Liberia
AN  - 1784560042
AB  - We explore the impact of a rural agricultural value chain project in Liberia on smallholder farmers, their households and children in order to better understand the link between household economic welfare and child wellbeing. Drawing on longitudinal field-based quasi-experimental survey data, we estimate the causal effect of the project on the use of modern farming techniques and production, household assets and food security, and child education, health and nutrition. Mixed-methods include multiple rounds of focus groups with farmers, key informant interviews with community leaders, and project monitoring farmer diaries. Treatment farmers showed increased use of modern farming techniques and improved production, households experienced greater access to food, and while no significant changes were found for children, for the outcomes of interest, treatment children outcomes trended in the positive direction. The evaluation suggests that participation in agricultural value chain interventions contributes to positive farm outcomes and social assets, but economic-focused activities alone are insufficient to improve children's lives. Since improving the lives of children from birth is critical to breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty, economic strengthening programs like value chain interventions, must monitor their effects on children: to do no harm and to identify and take advantage of opportunities to improve the lives of children.

T1  - Making Mechanization Accessible to Smallholder Farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa
AN  - 2124634992
AB  - This paper summarizes the deliberations at a meeting convened by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation held in Beijing in October 2015. Farm power and mechanization are agricultural production inputs that will be essential to raise the labor and land productivity required if Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 2 (ending poverty and hunger) are to be achieved. The smallholder farm sector demand for mechanization needs to be raised to stimulate the product value chain and activate input supply (that is to raise farm productivity, stimulate value addition, and encourage private sector custom hire service provision). The sustainability of mechanization from a natural resource conservation point of view is discussed with reference to conservation agriculture principles. Mechanization appropriate for the smallholder sector covers the range of possible power sources human, draft animal and motorized. The key is to engage all the stakeholders in the supply chain and offer a range of suitable options from which the user can select. Sustainability of mechanization includes financial and social, as well as environmental factors. Local manufacturers should be supported where feasible as they can provide implements and machines adapted to local conditions—and better technical service and replacement part supply. The public sector role in providing access to mechanization should be restricted to promulgating enabling policies, building technical and business management skills and stimulating demand. The lessons to be learnt from Chinese experience in making mechanization available to smallholder farmers include subsidies, strong extension services, infrastructure development and a solid manufacturing sector that prioritizes the smallholder sector. The implications for sub-Saharan Africa appear to be that group ownership and custom hire service provision are the models to follow. Finally, the relevance of an African Center for Sustainable Agricultural Mechanization, on the model of CSAM in Beijing, is considered and recommended.

T1  - Price satisfaction and producer loyalty
AN  - 2081647128
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate which dimensions of price satisfaction influence producers’ trust in buyers and assess the mediating role of such trust in the relationship between price satisfaction and producer loyalty in fresh fruit supply chains. Design/methodology/approach – A cross-sectional study design using both semi-structured interviews and structured questionnaires was used. The study was conducted in the Eastern part of Kenya and included 600 smallholders. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings – The results show that price fairness, price reliability, and relative price are dimensions of price satisfaction that affect producers’ trust in the buyer. Moreover, trust between the producer and the buyer is found to be a strong mediator between price satisfaction and producer loyalty. The findings support recent studies about trust and its mediating role. Research limitations/implications – The paper is based on a cross-sectional study design, limiting the causal inferences which can be drawn. Producers’ preferences change with time and future studies should be based on longitudinal designs. Originality/value – This paper shows the relationship between the multi-dimensional nature of price satisfaction and producer loyalty with trust as a mediating variable in the business-to-business (B2B) context. Although B2B relationships have been shown to be of great importance for smallholders in enhancing business performance with their buyers, little attention has been given to the role of trust as a mediator. This study offers interesting insights into the how trust plays a mediating role between price satisfaction and loyalty in a developing country context.

T1  - Contract Farming and Vulnerability to Poverty among Oil Palm Smallholders in Indonesia
AN  - 1779487214
AB  - This article addresses smallholder oil palm farming in Indonesia and the risk of falling into poverty by comparing contract and non-contract smallholders. We use an asset-based approach to define vulnerability and apply propensity score matching analysis to assess the impact of contract farming. Data were collected from a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2010 of 245 oil palm smallholder households, 126 of which were contract smallholders. The study finds that approximately 40 per cent of oil palm smallholders can be classified as stochastic-transient poor. We also show that while contract participation reduces the negative impact of oil palm price shocks, this is not the case for production shocks. The study concludes that despite positive income effects, contract smallholders also remain vulnerable to poverty.

T1  - Farm to Factory Gendered Employment: The Case of Blue Skies Outgrower Scheme in Ghana
AN  - 2442961294
AB  - Since the 1980s, a neoliberal paradigm has guided agricultural policy formulation in Africa with an unflinching preference for the commercialization of agriculture through the incorporation of smallholder farmers into global circuits of accumulation via outgrower arrangements. The paradigm has claimed that the promotion of integrated value chains will create jobs and enhance incomes in agrarian areas. This article assesses the manner in which men and women are positioned differentially in the outgrower value chains in terms of employment benefits. Drawing on interviews, the article explores the employment pattern in the outgrower value chain system and the structural dynamics that lead to benefits, or otherwise, for men and women in Ghana’s largest fruit-processing company, Blue Skies, and its outgrower farms. This study finds that many jobs were created along the value chain for men and women, but that men have occupied the high-earning echelon of the value chain as outgrowers, as well as more secure positions as permanent staff in the factory, women have largely been employed as disposable casual workers in these two spaces.

T1  - Global Value Chain in Agro-export Production and Its Socio-economic Impact in Michoacán, Mexico
AN  - 1788341525
AB  - Mexican blackberry production is very geographically concentrated in the Valley Los Reyes, where most of blackberries, which the country exports, are produced. Taking into account that Mexico is the world's largest exporter of this fruit in terms of quantity; we can conclude that a relatively small area produces most of the blackberries that are traded worldwide. The paper aims to analyze the blackberry value chain and its local socio-economic impact. The main conclusion is that the global value chain of blackberries brings benefits for the small farmers and investors too, but it is necessary establish contract terms ensuring that contractors do not abuse their market power. Also it was demonstated the positive local socio-economic impact of the activity.

T1  - Cooperative membership and dairy performance among smallholders in Ethiopia
AN  - 1773274247
AB  - This study assesses the impact of cooperative membership among dairy producers in Selale, Ethiopia. We selected ten impact indicators: proportion of dairy income to total household income, total dairy income, proportion of crossbreed cows to the total number of cows in the herd (indicator of technological innovation), amount of feed bought (another indicator of technological innovation), milk production, milk productivity, commercialization, price per liter of milk, price per kg of butter and the share of milk production that is processed at the household level. In order to minimize the biases that may arise by simply comparing members and non-members, we employed a propensity score matching technique. The empirical analysis shows that cooperatives are strong in facilitating technological transformations and commercialization but weak in offering better prices. These findings suggest structural trade-offs between different domains of cooperatives' action. Overall, our study concludes that cooperatives can be efficient business institutions to foster rural development and food security.

T1  - Household level spillover effects from biofuels: Evidence from castor in Ethiopia
AN  - 1773274110
AB  - The indirect effects of biofuels are mostly considered negative. In this paper, we argue that there may be a positive indirect effect of biofuels on food security and poverty. Using micro-level evidence and a matched plot pair design through which we control for plot and farmer characteristics, we show that the introduction of castor production for biofuel in a poor country as Ethiopia can significantly improve food productivity of rural households who produce raw material for biofuel production. This spillover seems particularly linked to enhanced access to inputs and technical assistance which were provided as part of biofuel feedstock production contracts. Our results thus document another mechanism through which biofuels may influence smallholders' food security, a mechanism that did not receive attention so far.

T1  - Microbial Contamination and Hygiene of Fresh Cow’s Milk Produced by Smallholders in Western Zambia
AN  - 2628159023
AB  - A field study was performed to assess safety of smallholder fresh cow’s milk around Mongu, Western Province, Zambia. This involved observation and sampling of milk along the value chain from milking to point-of-sale and storage. Samples were collected from 86 cows, from 9 farmers, selling through two dairy cooperatives, with additional samples from informal markets. Production was very low; around one litre/day/cow and 10 L/day/herd. The milk was typically transported by bicycle in high ambient temperatures without refrigeration until reaching the point-of-sale (journey times of 30–120 min), where it was sold without pasteurisation despite milk-borne zoonoses being endemic (bovine tuberculosis (bTB) and Brucellosis). Although microbiological contamination was initially low, with geometric mean total bacterial count (TBC) of 425 cfu/mL (cfu = colony forming units) upon arrival at point-of-sale, poor hygiene led to high bacterial loads later on (geometric mean TBC > 600,000 cfu/mL after two days refrigeration), with almost all samples culture positive for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. After milking, milk was kept for 100–223 min at temperatures favouring microbial growth (median 34 °C) and sold without a microbial kill step. In this situation limited variation in observed standards of milk hygiene had no significant effect on milk end-product bacterial counts. Options for refrigerated transport are limited. Pasteurisation at the cooperative should be investigated, as this would largely remove pathogenic microbes present in the milk whether resulting from cattle infection or poor hygiene during milking and transportation. As milk is also purchased directly from producers, on-farm milk heating options should also be assessed. Smallholders may benefit from access to national markets by providing milk to large dairies, which have systems for ensuring safety. However, this requires significant investment and an increased and more consistent supply of milk; and many consumers, unable to afford milk sold through formal sectors, would not benefit.

T1  - Does contract farming improve smallholder income? The case of avocado farmers in Kenya
AN  - 2117435076
AB  - Purpose – Contract farming (CF) is seen as a tool for creating new market opportunities hence increasing incomes for smallholder farmers. Critics, however, argue that CF is likely to pass risks to small scale farmers, thus favouring large scale farmers at the expense of smallholder farmers. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of CF on smallholder farmers’ income using a case study of avocado farmers in Kandara district in Kenya. Design/methodology/approach – The study uses data collected from 100 smallholder avocado farmers in Kandara district in Kenya and employs an instrumental variable model (Probit-2SLS) to control for endogeneity in participation in the contract and examine the effect of CF on household, farm and avocado income. Findings – The results indicate that participation in CF is not sufficient to improve household, farm and avocado income. Question remains regarding efficient implementation of CF arrangements to promote spill over effects on other household enterprises. Research limitations/implications – The research was carried out using farmers in Kandara district in Kenya as a case study, findings might therefore not reflect the status of CF in all countries. Originality/value – The paper contributes to the growing debate on the effect of value chain upgrading strategies such as contracting on smallholder farmers’ welfare. The form of contracting studied in this paper differs from the standard contracts in that the key stakeholders (producers) are loosely enjoined in the contract through officials of their groups.

T1  - Determinants of crop diversification amongst agricultural co-operators in Dundwa agricultural camp, Choma district, Zambia
AN  - 1896359874
AB  - A sound understanding of the socio-economic characteristics of smallholder farmers and how they influence their crop diversification decisions would help policy makers in crafting appropriate measures for promoting crop diversification. The objectives of this study is to assess the degree of crop diversification and the factors influencing crop diversification among the farm households at Dundwa Agricultural Camp of Zambia. The study uses primary data collected from 60 farm households using structured questionnaire during the period October to November 2014. The degree of crop diversification among farm households was measured using the Entropy index. Further, the censored Tobit model was used to examine how the farmers? socioeconomic characteristics influences crop diversification. The mean entropy index is 0.88 and this showsa very high degree of crop diversification among the farmers. The Tobit regression model showed that crop diversification is positively influenced by the gender of head of household, the production of cash crops by the household and household investment in basic farming equipment. On contrary, the age of head of household, total farm size, access to agricultural markets and total area cultivated negatively influenced crop diversification. The study recommends for increased capacity building of female headed households in farm decision-making and promoting household investment in basic farming implements as measures to promoting crop diversification.

T1  - Household food security and biofuel feedstock production in rural Mozambique and Tanzania
AN  - 1880859695
AB  - The ongoing debate over the impact of biofuels on food security makes it difficult for governments to develop clear policies for an industry that can enhance rural employment and help to alleviate rural poverty, but may also reduce food availability and raise food prices. Whilst there have been many studies reporting a wide range of global commodity price impacts arising from the sharp rise in biofuel use over the past decade, there has been less evidence on food security impacts at a local level in developing countries. Where evidence does exist the impact is difficult to assess, often due to different types of production models and feedstocks, but also due to weaknesses in the methodologies and measures of food security used. This paper aims to help address this evidence gap by analysing household survey data from sites close to different types of biofuel operations in Mozambique and Tanzania, using an index that measures key macronutrient and micronutrient deficits at the household level. The results show that those households with employees in medium to large-scale biofuel feedstock operations achieved significantly higher food security outcomes than other households in the same locations. Furthermore, most of the households with better food security outcomes reported an improvement in food security since the biofuel operations had been established and attributed this mainly to increased and more regular income from salaried employment.

T1  - An Evaluation of Market Participation Challenges of Small Holder Farmers in Zululand District, Kwazulu Natal, South Africa
AN  - 1877773541
AB  - This paper highlighted factors affecting agricultural market participation and the promotion of the establishment of vegetable markets, fruit markets and nurseries in the Zululand District, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. This entailed taking a representative sample consisting of 50 agricultural projects, with 418 beneficiaries participating in the research. The following 5 local municipalities were visited: Mahlabathini, Nongoma, Pongola, Dumbe and Abaqulusi. Quantitative and qualitative design was used as a detailed questionnaire written in English, with a focus group discussion, a stakeholder's discussion, and field observations as part of the data collection. A purposive sampling technique was used to select fifty (50) projects, in order to cover uniformity and homogenous characteristics such as infrastructure requirements, skills availability, production challenges, agricultural training needs, water source needs, educational level and others. Data was coded, captured and analysed with a software package for social sciences (SPSS version 20). The following analyses were conducted: Descriptive and Univariate Regression. The results showed a significant association among the following variables: Age, Educational level, Farming experience, Land acquisition, Crops planted, Water source, Farming fulltime, Land size, Production inputs, Agricultural training and Market participation. It is recommended that factors determining market participation should be addressed first and then fruit and vegetable markets can be established, as well as the creation of a complete, viable agro value chain that will expand community driven agricultural production and processing.

T1  - Influence of Voluntary Coffee Certifications on Cooperatives' Advisory Services and Agricultural Practices of Smallholder Farmers in Costa Rica
AN  - 1871577214; EJ1117352
AB  - Purpose: This article explores how voluntary certifications influence the way cooperatives provide advisory services to their members and the influence of these services on agricultural practices. Design/Methodology/Approach: Case studies were conducted in four representative Costa Rican cooperatives interviewing twenty interviewed cooperative administrators and members to determine changes in advisory services and farming practices over the past twenty years and factors which influenced those changes. Findings: Certifications induce cooperatives to offer new services to support farmers. Cooperatives form collaborations with new stakeholders or reconfigure existing collaborations to provide advisory services to their members. These services have helped to shape farmers' attitudes about sustainable farming practices, though farm-level changes may be small. The main change at the cooperative level is adding new topics for group training, and certification issues are directly linked with practices such as maintaining a farm record book or wearing a mask when applying pesticides. Practices which compete with productivity are unlikely to change. Practical Implications: The results are useful to improve the advisory services provided by cooperatives by better identifying the key issues to be addressed to fulfill the certifications' requirements. Theoretical implications: Cooperatives are a relevant player to induce more sustainable practices, by providing or coordinating advisory services, but their efforts cannot be seen disconnected from a broader institutional environment. Originality/Value: We demonstrate that certifications change the intensity and scope of advisory services and induce cooperatives to engage with a more diverse network of stakeholders.

T1  - POLICIES OF AGRICULTURAL MODERNIZATION AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN COLOMBIA (1996 - 2008)
AN  - 1833971158
AB  - This paper addresses the policies of Colombian agricultural modernization from the period 1996 - 2008, which was exposed to an extreme change on the growth trend of agronomic total productivity factors (PTF) and suffered one of the most violent periods in Colombia. This paper takes into consideration the state-supported credit system that existed and aimed to allow the agricultural sector to compete with external markets, seeking equilibrium between measures aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the agricultural sector and those directed at rural wellbeing. In this context, Colombia is working to increase the competitiveness of the agricultural sector; nevertheless, over 95% of resources are provided based on financial criteria and less than 5% are directed toward other necessities. Financing through credit explains one aspect of the evolution of Colombian agricultural production. It is because of this that smallholder farmers with a high level of social capital have to compete using the same rules as large-scale producers, exporters and emerging producers, all of whom are favored as politically strategic sectors in the Free Trade Agreement (FTA). This creates a complex agricultural landscape, as it aims to maintain large, medium and small producers while the volume of money granted is not proportional to the number of beneficiaries. This means that, in some cases, agricultural social policies are ineffective, perpetuating subsistence agriculture with low levels of technology and productivity. Some exceptions exist, however, such as in the case of coffee, banana, potato and rice producers who are supported by producer associations, allowing them to have some political weight and consequently greater competitiveness. For this reason, the experiences of the FTA should be reviewed from a technical, economic and social cost standpoint.

T1  - Chapter Four: Climate Resilient Villages for Sustainable Food Security in Tropical India: Concept, Process, Technologies, Institutions, and Impacts
AN  - 1824612095
AB  - The world population is expected to increase by a further three billion by 2050 and 90% of the three billion will be from developing countries that rely on existing land, water, and ecology for food and well-being of human kind. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its fifth assessment report (AR5) stated that warming of the climate system is unequivocal and is more pronounced since the 1950s. The atmosphere and oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen. Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850 and the globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85°C (0.65-1.06°C) over the period of 1880-2012. World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ranked 2015 as the hottest year on record.

              
Climate change poses many challenges to growth and development in South Asia. The Indian agriculture production system faces the daunting task of feeding 17.5% of the global population with only 2.4% of land and 4% of water resources at its disposal. India is more vulnerable to climate change in view of the dependence of huge population on agriculture, excessive pressure on natural resources, and relatively weak coping mechanisms. The warming trend in India over the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.6°C, which is likely to impact many crops, negatively impacting food and livelihood security of millions of farmers. There are already evidences of negative impacts on yield of wheat and paddy in some parts of India due to increased temperature, water stress, and reduction in number of rainy days. Significant negative impacts have been projected under medium-term (2020-39) climate change scenario, for example, yield reduction by 4.5-9%, depending on the magnitude and distribution of warming. Since agriculture currently contributes about 15% of India's gross domestic product (GDP), a negative impact on production implies cost of climate change to roughly range from 0.7% to 1.35% of GDP per year.

              
Indian agriculture, with 80% of farmers being smallholders (<0.5ha) having diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, is monsoon-dependent rainfed agriculture (58%), about 30% of population undernourished, migration from rural to urban regions, child malnutrition etc., has become more vulnerable with changed climate or variability situations. During the past decade, frequency of droughts, cyclone, and hailstorms increased, with 2002, 2004, 2009, 2012, and 2014 being severe droughts. Frequent cyclones and severe hailstorms in drought prone areas have become common. Eastern part of the country is affected by seawater intrusion. Reduced food grain productivity, loss to vegetable and fruit crops, fodder scarcity, shortage of drinking water to animals during summer, forced migration of animals, severe loss to poultry and fishery sectors were registered, threatening the livelihoods of rural poor.

              
Enhancing agricultural productivity, therefore, is critical for ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly the resource-poor, small, and marginal farmers who would be the most affected. In the absence of planned adaptation, the consequences of long-term climate change on the livelihood security of the poor could be severe. In India, the estimated countrywide agricultural loss in 2030 is expected to be over $7 billion that will severely affect the income of at least 10% of the population. However, this could be reduced by 80%, if cost-effective climate resilient measures are implemented.

              
Climate risks are best addressed through increasing adaptive capacity and building resilience which can bring immediate benefits and can also reduce the adverse impacts of climate change. Climate resilient agriculture (CRA) encompasses the incorporation of adaptation and resilient practices in agriculture which increases the capacity of the system to respond to various climate-related disturbances by resisting damage and ensures quick recovery. Such disturbances include events such as drought, flood, heat/cold wave, erratic rainfall pattern, pest outbreaks, and other threats caused by changing climate. Resilience is the ability of the system to bounce back and essentially involves judicious and improved management of natural resources, land, water, soil, and genetic resources through adoption of best bet practices.

              
CRA is a way to achieve short- and long-term agricultural development priorities in the face of climate change and serves as a bridge to other development priorities. It seeks to support countries and other actors in securing the necessary policy, technical and financial conditions to enable them to: (1) sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes in order to meet national food security and development goals, (2) build resilience and the capacity of agricultural and food systems to adapt to climate change, and (3) seek opportunities to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and increase carbon sequestration. These three conditions (food security, adaptation, and mitigation) are referred to as the "triple winâ[euro] of overall CRA.

              
The concept of climate resilient village (CRV) has been taken up by Government of India, to provide stability to farm productivity and household incomes and resilience through livelihood diversification in the face of extreme climatic events like droughts, cyclones, floods, hailstorms, heat wave, frost, and seawater inundation. Development of CRVs warrants establishment of a host of enabling mechanisms to mobilize and empower communities in the decision-making process to manage and recover from climate risks.

              
The overall program of establishing CRVs have structured village level institutions such as Village Climate Risk Management Committee (VCRMC), custom hiring center (CHC) for farm implements, community seed and fodder banks, commodity groups etc. The establishment of CRVs was based on bottom-up approach with village community taking a central role in decision making on institutional requirements, technological interventions and supporting systems with able support from experts. In our knowledge, the CRV network of National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) is by far the largest outreach program involving farmer's participation ever undertaken in the field of climate change adaptation anywhere in the world.

              
Planning, coordination, monitoring, and capacity building of the program at the country level is the responsibility of the research organization (ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture). At the district level, Krishi Vigyan Kendra  (KVK; Farm Science Centre) under the Division of Agricultural Extension under Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), All India Coordinated Research Project for Dryland Agriculture (AICRPDA) centers and Transfer of Technology divisions of various ICAR Institutions across the country are responsible in implementing the project at village level through farmers' participatory approach.

              
To address the climate vulnerabilities of the selected villages, different interventions were planned under the four modules; however, the specific intervention under each module for a particular village was need based and decided based on climatic vulnerability and resource situation of the particular village. The four intervention modules being implemented are (1) Natural resource management (in situ moisture conservation, biomass mulching, residue recycling, manure management, soil health card-based nutrient application, water harvesting and recycling for supplementary or life saving irrigation, improved drainage in high rainfall/flood prone villages, conservation tillage, and water saving irrigation methods). (2) Crop production module consisting of introduction of short-duration and drought/flood-tolerant varieties, modifications in planting dates for postrainy (winter) season crops to cope with terminal heat stress, water saving paddy systems (System of Rice Intensification, aerobic, direct seeding), frost management in fruit/vegetables, community nursery in staggered dates to meet delay in onset of monsoon, energy-efficient farm machinery through village CHC with timely completion of farm operation in limited sowing window, location specific intercropping systems, and suitable agroforestry systems. (3) Module III covers livestock and fisheries interventions through augmentation of fodder production, fodder storage methods, prophylaxis, and improved shelters for reducing heat stress in livestock, management of fish ponds/tanks during water scarcity and excess water, and promotion of livestock as climate adaptation strategy. (4) Module IV consists of village level institutions, collective marketing groups, introduction of weather-based insurance, and climate literacy though establishment of automated weather stations.

              
Impacts of these climate resilient interventions in the villages were assessed through various resilience indicators, importantly, improved farm productivity, farm income, livelihoods at household and village level. Environmental impacts were assessed on improved soil carbon sequestration, groundwater recharge, vegetation and forest cover, and measurements of GHG emissions which were correlated with ex ante assessment of village level carbon balance and overall contribution to global warming potential.

              
These 151 CRVs are learning sites for further expanding resilient villages to adjoining clusters and districts so that large number of villages will become part of the overall adaptation-led climate change mitigation mission in the country.

T1  - Informal Workers' Aggregation and Law
AN  - 1789309090
AB  - In India, more than ninety percent of the workforce is informal. In spite of this enormous percentage of informal workers, these workers remain invisible to law and policy circles. One of the reasons for such exclusion and invisibility is the absence of unionism involving informal workers. In order to overcome this invisibility, informal workers are increasingly organizing into associations that are different from traditional trade unions. These organizations devise their strategies and their legal statuses in view of the atypical characteristics of informal activities. In this Article, I document some of these organizations of self-employed informal workers in India - their characteristics and functions. On this basis, I contend that these organizations offer a model for collective action by informal workers. I argue that these associations are a [sui generis] organization of informal workers, and could become a precursor to solidarity-based collective initiatives by informal workers globally. In the backdrop to this proposition, I analyze the role of law in promoting such aggregation of informal workers in furtherance of their collective action. I argue that while organizations of informal workers in India employ the existing legal framework to the best of their advantage, the law fails to recognize some of their status as workers, thereby creating hurdles towards informal workers' collective action.

              
A small farmer works on her own farm. In tough times, she also works on other farms as a laborer. When the agriculture season is over, she goes to the forest to collect gum and other forest produce. Year round, she produces embroidered items either at a piece rate for a contractor or for sale to a trader who comes to her village to buy goods. Now, how should her trade be categorized? Does she belong to the agricultural sector, the factory sector, or the home-based work sector? Should she be categorized as a farmer or a farm worker? Is she self-employed or is she a piece-rate worker? Because her situation cannot be defined and contained neatly in a box, she has no work status and her right to representation in a union is unrealized. She is denied access to financial services or training to upgrade her skills. The tyranny of having to belong to a well-defined "category" has condemned her to having no "identity."

T1  - Contract farming risks: A quantitative assessment
AN  - 1772109131
AB  - The objective of this study is to identify the key risks facing each of the stakeholders in the export-focused paprika value chain in Zambia. Although a deterministic cost-benefit analysis indicated that this outgrower scheme would have a very satisfactory net present value (NPV), a Monte Carlo analysis using an integrated financial-economic-stakeholder model identifies a number of risk variables that could make this system unsustainable. The major risks include the variability of the real exchange rate in Zambia; the international price of paprika; and the farm yield rates. This analysis points out that irrigation systems are very important for both stabilising and increasing yields. The analysis also shows the limitations of loan financing for such outgrower arrangements when at the sector level it is difficult or even impossible to mitigate the risks from real exchange rate movements and changes in international commodity prices. This micro-level analysis shows how critical real exchange rate management policies are in achieving sustainability of such export-oriented value chains.

T1  - Comparative analysis of tomato value chain competitiveness in selected areas of Malawi and Mozambique
AN  - 2684361886
AB  - This paper discusses tomato value chain performance in Malawi and Mozambique using data collected from a market study commissioned by the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture as part of a regional research on conservation agriculture in maize-based farming systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. The results show that Malawi has a slightly higher competitive advantage in the production of tomato compared to Mozambique. Malawi’s relative competitiveness in tomato is mainly due to slightly higher productivity and the cost advantage in labor (low wages) and irrigation costs. The paper proposes policy implications aimed at raising the productivity and trade competitiveness of tomato, as this will ensure the overall productivity of the maize-based smallholder farming systems in the two countries.

T1  - Growth of rural migrant enclaves in Guangzhou, China: Agency, everyday practice and social mobility
AN  - 1732582412
AB  - Previous studies have attributed the proliferation of rural migrant enclaves in China's large cities primarily to the constraints limiting migrants' residential options. Through an ethnographic exploration of Xiaohubei, a migrant enclave with a high concentration of Hubei rural migrants and small-scale garment producers in Guangzhou, this paper sheds new light on the dynamics and implications of the migrant enclaves. It argues that rural migrants are actually active agents who develop a vibrant garment manufacturing cluster by establishing a flexible garment production system, embedding their business within the enclave and maintaining a nationwide translocal network. It also contends that the enclave provides a feasible path through which migrants can achieve social mobility and adapt themselves to the urban environment. This paper concludes with a plea to take into account the agency and everyday practice of rural migrants when understanding the migrant enclaves and a reflection on the existing large-scale and indiscriminate demolition of the enclaves.

T1  - Dynamics of decline in small-scale sugarcane production in South Africa: Evidence from two 'rural' wards in the Umfolozi region
AN  - 1748859350; 2011-894086
AB  - Using evidence from two rural wards in the Umfolozi region, this paper critically investigates the dynamics and constraints of small-scale sugarcane production under conditions of decline. The rapid decline in small-scale sugarcane production was historically underwritten by regulatory reforms that paired processes of enhanced representational inclusion with measures of rationalisation, resulting in deteriorating terms of exchange and the retraction of intensive interventions in production by sugar millers (Dubb, 2015). It is argued that, together with drought, these changes severely undermined the efficiency of capital services offered by local tractor-owning contractors and the productivity of small growers as a whole, while social grants have acted as a barrier to intensifying the exploitation of neighbours. The resultant cost-price squeeze has rendered cane an increasingly unattractive site of investment of labour and wages, and witnessed the severe decline or exit of most growers. For some, social grants have nonetheless provided a consumptive base from which to commit homestead labour without drawing down on cane proceeds, and hence enabled them to 'hang in' or marginally 'creep-back' into production. Only contractor-growers have managed to increase production, but this in turn is premised on the precarious cross-subsidization of their dual enterprises. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Innovations in financing of agri-food value chains in China and India
AN  - 2082129889
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to synthesize lessons from the agricultural value chain models and their associated financing mechanisms in China and India as to provide policy recommendations on how best to facilitate development of efficient and inclusive value chains. Design/methodology/approach – The paper builds on a review of the existing literature on agricultural value chains and their financing mechanisms, and draws lessons from it for strengthening interface between product and financial markets in order to enable smallholders capture benefits of the value addition. Findings – From the comparative review of value chain financing mechanisms and current policy contexts the authors find dominance of internal financing of value chains (in terms of provision of inputs, technology and services) in both the countries. Value chain finance from commercial banks and other financial institutions is limited and mainly through tripartite agreements among the financing institutions, lead firms and farmers. Practical implications – The lessons drawn from various value chain models and their financing mechanisms provide feedback to financial institutions and policymakers to take measures to strengthen value chain finance in smallholder agriculture. Originality/value – The paper undertakes a rigorous review of the existing value chain models and their financing mechanisms in light of the most recent research on emerging innovations and development strategies, in order to glean key lessons for policy recommendations on strengthening linkages between financial and product markets.

T1  - THE AFRO-BRAZILIAN COLLECTIVE LAND: Analyzing Institutional Changes in the Past Two Hundred Years
AN  - 1792174355
AB  - Afro-Brazilian communities (quilombos) hold rights to a collective territory where they live and that supports their livelihoods. Historically, Afro-Brazilian smallholders have been subjected to contradictory programs and policies that either restrain traditional practices such as shifting cultivation or aim at empowering these communities. This is the first attempt to adopt the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) theoretical framework to study the historical transformation of the institutional structure in Afro-Brazilian territories of the Ribeira Valley, São Paulo, Brazil. Our results reveal a history of long-term, continuous relationships between locals and external groups, sometimes combative and at other times cooperative, reflecting tensions and contradictions. As a result, quilombo communities have gradually emerged as leaders in an institutional arrangement that is moving toward co-governance or partnerships. We believe that if these communities achieve full economic and political autonomy, they might be able to self-govern their territories and reconcile the dual goals of local development and environmental conservation.

T1  - Transdisciplinary processes of developing, applying, and evaluating a method for improving smallholder farmers' access to (phosphorus) fertilizers: the SMAP method
AN  - 1717213748
AB  - Issue Title: Special Feature: The Reality of Transdisciplinary Processes              The lack of knowledge about fertilization, inadequate income to purchase fertilizers, limited access to the right type of fertilizers, and national policies have been identified as prerequisites of Sub-Saharan smallholder farmers' low yield and food insecurity. This paper presents how the smallholder access to phosphorus (SMAP) method was developed in a transdisciplinary process in Kenya, and what insights have been gained in a first application of the SMAP method. The transdisciplinary SMAP method comprises (1) farmers' participation in a transdisciplinary process including extension officers and local scientists to construct farm-specific fertilization strategies based on (2) farm-specific soil testing and (3) the construction of cooperative strategies for purchasing fertilizers involving farmers, traders, and financial institutions in a timely manner. The method aims to improve farmers' participation in the value chain. The development of the method followed the Zurich 2000 conception of transdisciplinarity. The development co-led by representatives of a cereal growers association and scientists from local and international universities included main actors of the national and local (phosphorus) fertilizer supply-demand chain. The first application of the SMAP method was evaluated by embedding an ANOVA (analysis of variance) study design following the ideas of experimental action research. There were significant effects of soil testing and a marginal significant effect of the transdisciplinary construction of farm-specific fertilization strategies. This paper presents the initial transdisciplinary project plan for developing the SMAP method, how the transdisciplinary process worked in reality, what obstacles were met in practice, and the benefits of practice and science that resulted from this transdisciplinary project.

T1  - Contract farming and the reorganisation of agricultural production within the Chókwè Irrigation System, Mozambique
AN  - 1900187182
AB  - This paper contributes to the discussion about 'inclusive business models' as alternatives to large-scale land acquisitions by analysing a case in which a foreign agribusiness investor, within an impact investment paradigm, acquired and rehabilitated a rice processing plant in Chókwè, Mozambique. A contract farming programme drawn up to source raw produce for the factory led to radical shifts in control over land and water resources. The case is set against the background of a large-scale irrigation system that has played an important role in national agricultural policies since colonial times. The private sector-led development approach is strongly supported by the state which portrays it as an opportunity to reduce its dependency on rice imports. The investor redirected the benefits of land and water use through taking a role of coordination and control within the irrigated production system.
The ensuing rural transformation reminds one of earlier periods in the development of the irrigation system: the central control over production, and the very high level of agricultural inputs and mechanisation, remind one of the state socialist period, while the removal of smallholders from their land and its concentration in the hands of a few bears a strong resemblance to the scheme's establishment under colonial rule.

T1  - Landscapes of Social Inclusion: Inclusive Value-Chain Collaboration Through the Lenses of Food Sovereignty and Landscape Governance
AN  - 1748861142; 2011-893423
AB  - Value-chain collaboration (VCC) aims to increase smallholder productivity and market integration. Higher productivity, better incomes and innovations have been documented, but also exclusionary trends and loss of biological and dietary diversity. New forms of VCC 'beyond the chain' hope to tackle this through collaboration with non-chain actors. Drawing on territorially embedded VCC, food sovereignty and landscape governance theories, this article presents a conceptual framework to analyse whether and how inclusive VCC, greater farmer autonomy and sustainable landscapes can be achieved. Key elements of our approach are knowledge of smallholders' various livelihood trajectories and selective value-chain engagement; multi-stakeholder definition of the sustainability choice space; and smallholder inclusion in adaptive learning and empowerment processes that bring together and integrate different and oft-competing knowledge systems and governance levels. This approach will support further action research in learning platforms in Ghana and South Africa. The article discusses the link with the broader inclusive development debate.

T1  - Accessibility of Rice Farmers to the Ghana School Feeding Programme and its Effect on Output
AN  - 1723738621
AB  - The Ghana School Feeding Programme (GSFP) is the Ghanaian version of a Home-Grown School Feeding Programme (HGSP) that has a mandate to give one hot meal a day to school children in public schools from kindergarten through to primary six. The programme was launched in 2005 with the goal of contributing to poverty reduction and increased food security in Ghana. One of the key objectives of the programme is to boost domestic food production by sourcing GSFP raw materials locally, and providing a sustainable market for local food producers in the community. To analyse accessibility of rice farmers to the Ghana School Feeding Programme and its effect on production in three districts of the Northern Region of Ghana, a formal cross section survey of 100 small holder rice farmers was conducted. The transcendental logarithmic production function was applied to analyse the programme's effect on rice output in the three districts using access to the GSFP and other input variables. Our results show that farm labour, farm size, and fertilizer application were significant in increasing farmers' output while access to the GSFP market was not. Again there is no significant difference between the output of those who had access to the school feeding programme and those who do not.

T1  - Social construction of the environment and smallholder farmers' participation in 'low-carbon', agro-industrial crop production contracts in the Philippines
AN  - 1748861533; 2011-891978
AB  - Several studies have suggested that socio-economic factors and production site characteristics are primary determinants of farmers' participation in 'low-carbon', agro-industrial (biofuels and oil palm) production contracts. In the Philippines, many smallholder farmers have expressed their intent to participate in intensive production of biofuel crops and oil palm with state and private organizations; others have resisted or remained indifferent. This study looks into smallholders' social construction of the environment and how this may influence their decisions to participate in such production contracts. The study is based on a survey of 462 respondents in eight communities in the province of Palawan. Using regression analysis, it illustrates how smallholders' sense of place and environmental worldviews, together with demographic and socio-economic variables, play significant roles in their decisions to enter into new biofuels (jatropha) and oil palm production contracts. Environmental worldviews are significant when there are strong negative perceptions attached to a particular crop production contract, as in the case of oil palm. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

T1  - Economic Impact and Challenges of Jatropha curcas L. Projects in North-Western Province, Zambia: A Case of Solwezi District
AN  - 1729213302
AB  - Forest products, wood and non-wood, remain vital among smallholder households in Zambia with charcoal being the most sought after product. This has led to increased exploitation of forest trees to meet the needs for fuel wood, among others. However, Jatropha curcas plant has been identified as a potential fuel source. In the early 2000s, profit-making organizations encouraged smallholder households to grow Jatropha for use as an alternative fuel source. This paper reports on a study conducted in Solwezi between 2011 and 2014 to evaluate the impact of Jatropha cultivation for biofuel production. A sample of 100 small-scale farmers involved in Jatropha cultivation and key informants were interviewed to evaluate the impact of growing Jatropha at the small-scale level. Results show that farmers lost out on time; income from sale of edible non-wood forest products; and experienced reduction in maize (Zea mays) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) production, worsening household economic conditions. Farmers attributed this loss to unclear policy alignment on biofuel production by government. We therefore recommend that project implementation should involve interactions of all legislative bodies and any other concerned stakeholders. There is also a need to promote the value chain, from production to marketing, which focuses on minimizing detrimental effects on the livelihood of small-scale farmers.

T1  - Small Farmers in High-Value Chains: Binding or Relaxing Constraints to Inclusive Growth?
AN  - 1682904997
AB  - Considerable empirical work relates participation in contract farming with farm profitability. However causation is far from settled as few studies control for endogeneity of participation. Moreover the link between contract farming and equity is ambiguous as the association between contract farming and farmer endowments is mixed. This case study of smallholders in the tobacco industry addresses these issues, and seems to be the first such econometric application in the Philippines. Based on a treatment effects regression, contract farming increases profitability, with participation biased toward smaller farm sizes, supporting the positive role of contract farming toward inclusive growth in rural areas.

T1  - The Gendered Impacts of Agricultural Asset Transfer Projects
AN  - 1790890687
AB  - This article explores the gendered impacts of a development project that provided dairy training and a superior breed of cattle to households as part of a broader effort to develop a smallholder-friendly, market-oriented dairy value chain in the Manica province of Mozambique. The project first targeted households, registered cows in the names of the household heads, and, initially, trained these cow owners in various aspects of dairy production and marketing. Subsequently, the training was expanded to two members per household to increase the capacity within households to care for cows, a change that resulted in the training of a significant number of women. Using qualitative and quantitative data on dairy production and consumption, and on gendered control over income and assets, the article explores how men and women participated in and benefited from the Manica Smallholder Dairy Development Program (MSDDP). We found that despite being registered in the name of men, in practice, dairy cattle are in some cases viewed as jointly owned by both men and women. Beneficiary households dramatically increased dairy production and income, with men, women, and children all contributing labor to this endeavor. Women's incentives for participation in dairy were less clear. Despite their recognized rights and responsibilities related to dairy cow management, women exercised relatively little control over milk and milk income as compared to men. This article explores the various monetary and nonmonetary benefits of MSDDP and dairying for women along with their implications for the level of effort put in by women, and the overall project outcomes.

T1  - Improving smallholder livestock farmers' incomes through value chain financing in South Africa
AN  - 1698955954; 4692965
AB  - Separating the commercialisation of agriculture from other programmes to improve access to formal credit for smallholder farmers is a source of dramatic failures of most programmes. Despite the popularity of value chain financing, livestock agriculture remains marginalised. This paper analyses the MAFISA-NERPO Livestock Credit Scheme, a scheme which provides value chain financial products in order to improve the cash incomes of smallholder farmers in South Africa. Evidence shows that more than 80% of participating farmers receive average annual incomes of US$30,000. This implies that this scheme has addressed those factors hindering effectiveness and efficiency of smallholder credit institutions, using value chain finance. //ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: La séparation de la commercialisation de l'agriculture d'autres programmes afin d'améliorer l'accès au crédit formel pour les petits agriculteurs est source d'échecs spectaculaires pour la plupart des programmes. Malgré la popularité du financement de la chaîne de valeur, l'élevage reste marginalisé. Cet article analyse le MAFISA-NERPO Livestock Credit Scheme, un programme qui fournit des produits financiers pour la chaîne de valeur afin d'améliorer les revenus monétaires des petits agriculteurs en Afrique du Sud. Selon les données factuelles, plus de 80% des agriculteurs participants reçoivent des revenus annuels moyens de 30 000 dollars US. Cela suggère que ce programme a remédié aux facteurs qui entravent l'efficacité et la rentabilité des institutions de crédit aux petits exploitants, à l'aide du financement de la chaîne de valeur. //ABSTRACT IN SPANISH: En la mayoría de los programas, la separación de la comercialización de productos agrícolas de aquellos programas orientados a mejorar el acceso al crédito formal para pequeños productores constituye una fuente de sonados fracasos. A pesar de la popularidad que goza el financiamiento de la cadena de valor, la ganadería permanece marginalizada. El presente artículo analiza el Programa de Crédito Ganadero mafisa-nerpo, diseñado para brindar productos financieros de la cadena de valor con el objetivo de elevar los ingresos en efectivo de los pequeños productores de Sudáfrica. La evidencia muestra que más de 80% de los agricultores participantes devengan ingresos anuales de US$30 mil en promedio, lo que significa que el programa ha mejorado aquellos factores que impedían la eficacia y la eficiencia de las instituciones de crédito para pequeños productores mediante el uso del financiamiento de la cadena de valor.

T1  - Impact of certification system on smallhold coffee farms' income distribution in Vietnam
AN  - 1895499897
AB  - This study attempts to investigate the impact of the working certification programs on the income of the coffee farms operated by the local smallholders at Dakha District, Kontum, Vietnam. Followed by the comparisons of the socio-demographic and economic characteristics between certified and non-certified farmers, the study adopts the Binary Probit model and linear regression model were applied to analyze the decision on farmers? attitude for participation on the available certification programs and their impacts. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to examine the average treatment effect of certification program on net coffee income per hectare to reduce the selection bias. Statistical results show that net coffee income per hectare is positively influenced by certification participation. Furthermore, education status the household head, number of members involved in coffee cultivation, distance from household to town center, and training availability effect significantly on net coffee income. Moreover, four matching algorithms of PSM highlighted that members of the certified cooperative achieve higher net coffee income per hectare compared to non-certified ones. Finally, how to introduce an organizational framework to assist local smallhold farmers and local coffee cooperatives become more effective and influential in domestic coffee value chain are suggested.

AB  - We are delegates representing diverse organizations and international movements of small-scale food producers and consumers, including peasants, indigenous peoples, communities, hunters and gatherers, family farmers, rural workers, herders and pastoralists, fisherfolk and urban people. Together, the diverse constituencies our organizations represent produce some 70% of the food consumed by humanity. They are the primary global investors in agriculture, as well as the primary providers of jobs and livelihoods in the world.We gathered here at the Nyéléni Center in Sélingué, Mali from 24 to 27 of February 2015, to come to a common understanding of Agroecology as a key element in the construction of Food Sovereignty, and to develop joint strategies to promote Agroecology and defend it from co-optation. We are grateful to the people of Mali who have welcomed us in this beautiful land. They have taught us through their example, that the dialogue of our various forms of knowledge is based on respectful listening and on the collective construction of shared decisions. We stand in solidarity with our Malian sisters and brothers who struggle – sometimes sacrificing their lives – to defend their territories from the latest wave of land grabbing that affects so many of our countries. Agroecology means that we stand together in the circle of life, and this implies that we must also stand together in the circle of struggle against land grabbing and the criminalization of our movements.

T1  - Enhancing food security with Islamic microfinance: insights from some recent experiments
AN  - 2076939174
AB  - Purpose – Islamic microfinance institutions (IsMFIs) have used diverse models and tools, as they seek to provide financial and non-financial support to the farming communities. A majortity of IsMFIs focus on provision of micro-credit to farmers alone as a means to enhance food security, following an approach similar to that of the conventional microfinance institutions. Others adopt a “finance-plus” approach and provide support in a multitude of areas other than finance, such as, technology, production, marketing, business development, capacity building, and thus, ultimately steering the project to success. The purpose of this paper is to examine the models and tools of Islamic agricultural finance for the rural poor that display major variations and draw lessons from a policy perspective. Design/methodology/approach – The study undertakes a comprehensive review of the principles, modes and models of Islamic agricultural finance targeted at small-holder farmers. It uses a case study method to review several winning initiatives by IsMFIs across the globe. It highlights the various risks and challenges confronting the projects and how the same are sought to be mitigated. Findings – Islamic agricultural finance for the rural poor involves a range of modes, mechanisms and institutional structures. Credit-based and sharing-based modes work well under specific conditions and there is no one-size-fits-all solution for financing the rural poor. Case studies of successful initiatives reveal that composite models involving the integration of philanthropy-based, not-for-profit as well as for-profit components may provide ideal solutions. Additional factors critical for success include provision of safety nets, involvement of community, non-financial support in a multitude of areas other than finance, such as, technology, procurement, production, marketing, business development and institutional capacity building. Originality/value – The paper addresses a fundamental issue in financing the poor farmers in Muslim societies – whether to opt for a credit-based approach that would ensure greater outreach or to go for a holistic intervention involving financing of the entire value chain. The findings are based on personal interaction of the author with professionals directly involved in the projects.

T1  - Agri-business Industry in India : Emerging Issues
AN  - 1970562729
AB  - India has enormous natural and physical endowments, viz. land, labour, water, livestock, fisheries, forestry, human resources, climate, new and renewable sources of energy, among others. Unfortunately, so far inadequate attention has been paid to scientifically assess, plan, fund and implement programs to develop agri-business. This has led to erosion and misuse of country's scarce and costly resources. There is, therefore, immediate need to exploit these resources through application of science and technology accompanied by timely and hassle-free provision of institutional credit, insurance and marketing services. Besides, independent accredited professional institution should be entrusted to evaluate the impact of the agri-business. This can make country's agriculture free from vagaries of monsoon and droughts and competitive in international export markets. Agri-business developed by private corporate houses and multinational organizations has been handicapped to exploit full potential of farm sector growth because of ever increasing number of small/marginal/tenant farmers, oral lessees, sharecroppers, agricultural labourers and continuing declining per capita farm land. Resultant effect has been striking undernourishment and mal-nourishment of children and pregnant women, hunger, unemployment and poverty in rural areas in particular. Lack of concern and commitment of institutions, rather than their weakness, has impacted adversely on (i) growth in public capital formation (ii) creation and productive use of land and water resources and (iii) farmers' ability to access knowledge/technology, inputs of production including credit on time and at reasonable rates. Last but not the least, it has not been able to minimize wastages of vegetables, fruits and food-grains (because of neglect of storage, processing and value chain infrastructure) that can make farm commodities incessantly available in domestic markets nullifying food-inflation effect. This can, also, help farmers enhance their farm income through annual export of marketable surplus of farm commodities in international markets.

T1  - Rural China in Transition: Changes and Transformations in China's Agriculture and Rural Sector +
AN  - 1790595607
AB  - Agribusiness companies operating in China are transacting in various forms with small agricultural producers, and in doing so, transforming the household-based agriculture in rural China. We argue that the presence of these distinct forms and the diverging relations between agribusiness and producers show the central importance of China's collective land rights. China's unique system of land rights - featuring collective ownership but individualized usage rights - has acted as a powerful force in shaping interactions between agribusiness and direct producers. It provides farmers a source of economic income as well as political bargaining power - albeit to various degrees - and restricts corporate actors from dispossessing farmers of their land. Because agribusinesses are able to work with small-scale producers in order to produce the high-scale production they need, we argue that Chinese leaders do not need to scale up land holdings in order to modernize agriculture. If China continues to provide land-use rights, China's smallscale producers can benefit from this modernization in unanticipated ways.

T1  - Enhancing food security with Islamic microfinance: insights from some recent experiments
AN  - 1691570548
AB  - Purpose

              
- Islamic microfinance institutions (IsMFIs) have used diverse models and tools, as they seek to provide financial and non-financial support to the farming communities. A majortity of IsMFIs focus on provision of micro-credit to farmers alone as a means to enhance food security, following an approach similar to that of the conventional microfinance institutions. Others adopt a "finance-plus" approach and provide support in a multitude of areas other than finance, such as, technology, production, marketing, business development, capacity building, and thus, ultimately steering the project to success. The purpose of this paper is to examine the models and tools of Islamic agricultural finance for the rural poor that display major variations and draw lessons from a policy perspective.

              
Design/methodology/approach

              
- The study undertakes a comprehensive review of the principles, modes and models of Islamic agricultural finance targeted at small-holder farmers. It uses a case study method to review several winning initiatives by IsMFIs across the globe. It highlights the various risks and challenges confronting the projects and how the same are sought to be mitigated.

              
Findings

              
- Islamic agricultural finance for the rural poor involves a range of modes, mechanisms and institutional structures. Credit-based and sharing-based modes work well under specific conditions and there is no one-size-fits-all solution for financing the rural poor. Case studies of successful initiatives reveal that composite models involving the integration of philanthropy-based, not-for-profit as well as for-profit components may provide ideal solutions. Additional factors critical for success include provision of safety nets, involvement of community, non-financial support in a multitude of areas other than finance, such as, technology, procurement, production, marketing, business development and institutional capacity building.

              
Originality/value

              
- The paper addresses a fundamental issue in financing the poor farmers in Muslim societies - whether to opt for a credit-based approach that would ensure greater outreach or to go for a holistic intervention involving financing of the entire value chain. The findings are based on personal interaction of the author with professionals directly involved in the projects.

T1  - Productivity differences between organic and other vegetable farming systems in northern Thailand
AN  - 1664830891
AB  - Abstract

              
We analyzed the productivity levels of smallholder farms in northern Thailand practicing different 'clean and safe' vegetable farming systems or conventional vegetable (CV) production. 'Clean and safe' farmers are categorized into three groups based on their use of synthetic chemicals: organic, pesticide-free and safe-use. Farm-level data on vegetable production were collected from random samples of farms operating these farming systems. A standard stochastic production frontier model and a metafrontier model were estimated for each system to obtain estimates of technical efficiency (TE) with respect to their cohorts, metatechnology ratios (MTRs, showing the extent of technology gaps between farming systems) and overall productivity measures. Productivity levels were found to vary moderately between farming systems. 'Clean and safe' farms achieved a higher mean TE score than conventional farms, indicating a more efficient use of inputs in producing a certain level of output within their system. However, their MTRs were significantly lower than those of conventional farmers, indicating greater production technology constraints because of the need to conform to strict guidelines. All four farming systems had at least one farmer who could overcome the technological constraints to achieve the highest possible output regardless of the technology used. Effective assistance providers were found to be crucial for farmers to achieve high productivity in the organic farming system. Improvements are needed to raise low productivity levels through technology transfer, value chain improvement and farmer capacity in production and marketing. The required improvement strategies differ among farming systems.

T1  - The challenge of intermediary coordination in smallholder sugarcane production in Tanzania
AN  - 1735648658; 201524557
AB  - Orthodox approaches to development view the market as a key institution for driving economic transformation and for fostering innovation and competitiveness. The working of markets alone, however, does not always lead to improved outcomes such as increase in productivity or production efficiency in the context of smallholders. The role of non-market institutions, therefore, remains important. This paper examines the role of intermediary coordination in addressing constraints to efficiency and productivity of smallholder sugarcane producers in Tanzania. It also makes a contrastive analysis of a different organisational arrangement for smallholder sugarcane producers in Malawi. The key proposition is that while intermediary organisations of cane outgrowers in Tanzania have played a significant role in promoting effective market linkage, an increase in productivity required for competitiveness is limited by the lack of effective horizontal coordination.

T1  - Banishing the thin months
AN  - 1673510734
AB  - The approximately 25 million rural people in the tropics who depend on coffee production face many hardships. And these are made much worse by volatile prices for coffee and other crops that rural families grow. Consumers have become increasingly aware of these difficulties, thanks in large part to the fair trade-certified coffee model. While still accounting for only a small proportion of total coffee sales, the market for fair-trade coffee has expanded significantly in recent years and has evidently benefitted many smallholder producers. To further ensure that coffee's backstory is getting better, Keurig Green Mountain Inc (formerly Green Mountain Coffee Roasters) -- the world's biggest buyer of fair trade-certified coffee -- invests millions of dollars in projects intended to improve the conditions in which smallholders work and live. Within the coffee value chain, there are other actors who believe in the importance of re-investing in coffee farm families part of the profits that their product generates.

T1  - Soil Quality Indices for Evaluating Smallholder Agricultural Land Uses in Northern Ethiopia
AN  - 1672890049
AB  - Population growth and increasing resource demands in Ethiopia are stressing and degrading agricultural landscapes. Most Ethiopian soils are already exhausted by several decades of over exploitation and mismanagement. Since many agricultural sustainability issues are related to soil quality, its assessment is very important. We determined integrated soil quality indices (SQI) within the surface 0-15 cm depth increment for three agricultural land uses: rain fed cultivation (RF); agroforestry (AF) and irrigated crop production (IR). Each land use was replicated five times within a semi-arid watershed in eastern Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. Using the framework suggested by Karlen and Stott (1994); four soil functions regarding soil's ability to: (1) accommodate water entry (WE); (2) facilitate water movement and availability (WMA); (3) resist degradation (RD); and (4) supply nutrients for plant growth (PNS) were estimated for each land use. The result revealed that AF affected all soil quality functions positively more than the other land uses. Furthermore, the four soil quality functions were integrated into an overall SQI; and the values for the three land uses were in the order: 0.58 (AF) > 0.51 (IR) > 0.47 (RF). The dominant soil properties influencing the integrated SQI values were soil organic carbon (26.4%); water stable aggregation (20.0%); total porosity (16.0%); total nitrogen (11.2%); microbial biomass carbon (6.4%); and cation exchange capacity (6.4%). Collectively, those six indicators accounted for more than 80% of the overall SQI values.

T1  - Characterisation of production, marketing and consumption patterns of farmed tilapia in the Nile Delta of Egypt
AN  - 1748861484; 2011-889824
AB  - Egypt has one of the world's largest aquaculture sectors which makes a significant contribution to income, employment creation and food security. However, there are very limited data available on the farmed tilapia value chain. The aim of this study therefore was to characterise production, marketing and consumption patterns of farmed tilapia in the Nile Delta of Egypt. A cross sectional study was conducted to collect data from tilapia producers (100), transporters (32), retailers (100), fish fry shops (20) and households (300) in three case study communities (fish producing, peri-urban and rural community). We conducted structured questionnaire interviews and participatory assessments for producers and consumers. Focus group discussions with mothers were also held to collect data for the availability, sources and consumption patterns of tilapia. Results showed that, more than half of producers were small scale, having a farm size of 10 feddan or less (1 feddan = 4200 m2). The main water supply for almost all farms was agricultural drain water, a potential source of contamination with chemical and biological hazards. The main production constraints were reported to be feed prices, water quality and availability, land rent, fuel and energy sources and environmental conditions. The farmed tilapia value chain was short with some value added in the form of marketing fresh and live fish as well as selling tilapia in fried or grilled form. The majority of produced tilapia was transported to retail sale and sold to consumers as fresh, while only a small proportion was processed by cleaning, grilling or frying. A lack of hygiene during transportation and marketing of farmed tilapia was found that could be potential sources for post-harvesting contamination. The availability and frequency of tilapia consumption were higher in the community in the production areas than in other communities. In non-producing areas, tilapia may be available in the market once a week during the village market day. Potential areas for further research in order to improve safety, quality and production of farmed tilapia were identified. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

T1  - Characterisation of production, marketing and consumption patterns of farmed tilapia in the Nile Delta of Egypt
AN  - 1680167879; 4670560
AB  - Egypt has one of the world's largest aquaculture sectors which makes a significant contribution to income, employment creation and food security. However, there are very limited data available on the farmed tilapia value chain. The aim of this study therefore was to characterise production, marketing and consumption patterns of farmed tilapia in the Nile Delta of Egypt. A cross sectional study was conducted to collect data from tilapia producers (100), transporters (32), retailers (100), fish fry shops (20) and households (300) in three case study communities (fish producing, peri-urban and rural community). We conducted structured questionnaire interviews and participatory assessments for producers and consumers. Focus group discussions with mothers were also held to collect data for the availability, sources and consumption patterns of tilapia. Results showed that, more than half of producers were small scale, having a farm size of 10 feddan or less (1 feddan = 4200 m2). The main water supply for almost all farms was agricultural drain water, a potential source of contamination with chemical and biological hazards. The main production constraints were reported to be feed prices, water quality and availability, land rent, fuel and energy sources and environmental conditions. The farmed tilapia value chain was short with some value added in the form of marketing fresh and live fish as well as selling tilapia in fried or grilled form. The majority of produced tilapia was transported to retail sale and sold to consumers as fresh, while only a small proportion was processed by cleaning, grilling or frying. A lack of hygiene during transportation and marketing of farmed tilapia was found that could be potential sources for post-harvesting contamination. The availability and frequency of tilapia consumption were higher in the community in the production areas than in other communities. In non-producing areas, tilapia may be available in the market once a week during the village market day. Potential areas for further research in order to improve safety, quality and production of farmed tilapia were identified. All rights reserved, Elsevier

T1  - From Farmers to Entrepreneurs-Strengthening Malta Orange Value Chains Through Institutional Development in Uttarakhand, India
AN  - 1667163827
AB  - Malta orange is an important cash crop in the mountain state of Uttarakhand, India. Smallholder farmers growing it face multiple challenges due to unorganized and inaccessible markets; they are forced to sell to intermediaries at very low prices. In response, the government of Uttarakhand introduced a minimum support price for Malta oranges; however, this failed to address farmers' problems due to poor implementation. This article presents the results of an action research project with farmers in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand to develop farmers' resilience by upgrading their position in the Malta orange value chain, targeting production, processing, and marketing through communitybased enterprise development. Information was collected before and after the intervention by various means, including stakeholder meetings, focus group discussions, and interviews with farmers and value chain facilitators. The research results show that policy change, improved provision of technical and financial services, establishment of common facility centers, and strengthening of farmers' institutions are imperative, to enable smallholder farmers to engage in value chains and thus increase their resilience.

T1  - Local agricultural financing and Islamic banks: is Qard-al-Hassan a possible solution?
AN  - 2138052682
AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to study Qard-al-Hasan (QH) (good loan) from the stand point of its possible application to agricultural farming with a view to augmenting the sources of Riba (interest)-free agricultural financing for Muslim farmers of Islamic countries like Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is a study of QH (good loan) from the stand point of its possible application to agricultural farming with a view to augmenting the sources of Riba (interest)-free agricultural financing for Muslim farmers of Islamic countries like Pakistan. Findings – The study reports that Riba-free financing is essentially needed by poor Muslim farmers who, owing to prohibition of Riba, do not rely on interest (Riba)-based financing. The study also shows that QH is a viable option for fulfilling this need and is beneficial for the farmers as well as for the Islamic banks or financial institutions. Research limitations/implications – The case of QH as a potential mode of agricultural financing, as presented in this paper, is based on a theoretical or conceptual framework. The findings need to be further substantiated with empirical evidence. A future study, based on reliable empirical data would certainly add value to the subject. Originality/value – Islamic banks and financial institutions typically rely on Musharakah (partnership), Murabaha (sale with profit), Ijarah (leasing), Salam (advance payment sale), Istisna’ (manufacturing contract), etc., and they rarely use QH as a mode of financing. Despite its huge utility, QH is practically non-existent in its application as an agricultural financing instrument. This paper presents a case for QH that can be adopted by Islamic banks or financial institutions for provision of the much needed financing for the small farmers of Islamic countries, as well as those living in non-Islamic countries.

T1  - LA CADENA DE VALOR DEL CACAO EN PERÚ Y SU OPORTUNIDAD EN EL MERCADO MUNDIAL *
AN  - 1784559886
AB  - The objective of this paper is to describe the characteristics of the cocoa value chain in Peru. For this, a documental type of study is carried out which describe the performance of the agricultural commodity markets, the commercialization of these, the way the value chain works in the country and an explanation of the national strategy for this product. The result suggests that the context under which the Peruvian cocoa is developing has its benefits given the problems being faced by African producers, the potential in the global market with Chinás and Indiás inclusion and the support given by the Government to small holders, which should be used during the formation of value chains.

T1  - DEVELOPMENT AID, AGRICULTURAL VALUE CHAINS AND FARMERS' BENEFITS: THE CASE OF VANILLA GROWERS IN KASESE, UGANDA
AN  - 1728660973; 201535283
AB  - This article assesses farmers' benefits from a donor-funded programme that promoted non-traditional agricultural export crops, specifically vanilla and hot pepper. Data was obtained from a survey of 125 farmers from eight farmers' associations working with a Dutch NGO and trading company, four focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Kasese Smallholder Income and Investment Programme used a value chain approach helping farmers at various stages. Farmers benefited from input loans, agricultural skills, extension services and a market for their produce. Vanilla producers were affected by the persistent drop in the crop prices, which affected the sustainability of associations beyond the Kasese Smallholder Income and Investment Programme. Stronger farmers' associations will give more benefits; the government should therefore promote a nationwide cooperative movement and crop regulatory authorities so as to be able to help farmers sustainability.

T1  - Governing Fair Trade Coffee Supply: Dynamics and Challenges in Small Farmers' Organizations
AN  - 1708525809; 2011-838045
AB  - Farmers' organizations are essential actors in fair trade certification schemes, and therefore in delivering their associated benefits for poor small-scale farmers. However, the dynamics and challenges faced by these cooperative organizations have been largely bypassed in the fair trade literature. In this context, this paper aims to unpack the multiple, coexisting and interwoven marketing channels available for small-scale coffee producers, unveiling potential sources of uncertainty and tensions among competing actors and interests, and identifying and assessing the strategies used by organizations to influence farmers' marketing decisions. The analysis comprises two case studies based in the department of Huehuetenango (Guatemala), where the existence of distinct marketing channels combines with processes of product differentiation, namely organic production. Results show the limitations of standard fair trade mechanisms to secure farmers' engagement with cooperative organizations. Rather, technical advice to improve farming practices and quality construction seem to be a more effective mechanism to govern this collective supply chain. Nevertheless, these strategies could be further constrained by productive and organizational factors, affecting the sustainability of potential benefits delivered by these key collective actors.

AN  - 1690737159
AB  - The majority of participants do not grow their own plants; rather, the plants are picked in the countryside and brought into the city. Continued access to plants from the countryside is key to both the maintenance of livelihoods and the preservation of traditional knowledge as the foundation of this livelihood. Some plants are purchased from farmers who grow them on small plots of land specifically for the traditional medicine market; others are gathered from wild lands, either forested or a ñu, a valley or a space without trees where the plants naturally grow. While many were concerned with the preservation of traditional knowledge, others were not overly concerned about access to these plants, believing that they are abundant in wild or agricultural spaces outside of the city. Yet some agricultural sciences faculty at the Universidad Nacional de Asunción have serious concerns about the biodiversity of medicinal plants;3 one explained that many medicinal plants are "pulled out by the roots" and cannot grow back (see Basualdo et al. 1991, 1995 for descriptions of some of the underground organs of plants sold as medicinal remedies in Mercado Cuatro). Of the 13 species of plants that Basualdo and colleagues (1991) collected from medicinal plant vendors in Mercado Cuatro, only one was cultivated, with the remainder growing in the wild. Another Universidad Nacional de Asunción faculty member reiterated that the primary method of obtaining medicinal plants-picking them in the wild-is an unsustainable practice at the rate they are currently being harvested. According to Bratschi (2013), some members of the Swiss Red Cross have similar concerns. This organization has been supporting Paraguayan efforts to sustainably produce medicinal plants and to preserve medicinal plant knowledge in the face of unregulated harvesting and, more importantly, ongoing deforestation that largely results from large-scale export-oriented soy production. As P. Richards (2011:347) points out, over the past 40 years, Paraguay's eastern forest has been pressured by "converging fronts of deforestation" by both smallholders and large-scale commodity agriculture. Governmental policies and practices that privilege agricultural expansion or ignore illegal deforestation affect biodiversity as a whole; in terms of medical plants that must be gathered in wild spaces, this both reduces accessibility and affects the sustainability of the remaining patches of land. The consolidation of land associated with largescale farming also has the potential to put at risk the availability of plants cultivated by small-scale farmers for the traditional medicine market.              Although it is a founding and full member of Mercosur, Paraguay's interests are not necessarily always aligned with those of Brazil and Argentina, the two larger markets in the agreement, and its smaller economy means it is unable to "actively frame the agenda for cooperation with its neighbours" (Bertelsmann Stiftung BTI 2012:27). Close economic ties to Brazil and Argentina also mean that Paraguay's currency and economic stability can be directly affected by economic fluctuations in these two countries (16, 27). Borraz and colleagues (2012) note asymmetries in the distribution of benefits from the Mercosur agreement and found that since its introduction Paraguayan wage labour incomes have suffered in almost all employment sectors. Vásquez-León's (2010) examination of two Paraguayan agricultural cooperatives provides some examples of the asymmetries farmers may experience when engaging with Mercosur trade partners. The organic sugar and banana cooperatives that Vásquez-León analyzes are both in direct competition with Brazil; although sugar is one of the country's larger agricultural products, it accounts for only 1 per cent of the sugar that enters Mercosur (2010:62). Even as states and private enterprises argue for better integration of the trade agreement, they may fail to enforce the agreement's regulations (67). This contributes to risk and dependency, not just for farming cooperatives but also for the country as a whole.

T1  - The Alternative Agriculture Network Isan and Its Struggle for Food Sovereignty - a Food Regime Perspective of Agricultural Relations of Production in Northeast Thailand
AN  - 1690632808
AB  - This paper uses the food regime analysis to visualize relations of domination and exploitation within the realm of food production and supply. Starting with an outlook on how the food regime plays out in the Thai context, the author goes on to elaborate its critical aspects fundamental for a food sovereignty critique: growing concentration of power on the side of transnational corporations, exploitative relations of production in agro-industry, and devastating effects for nature, small-scale producers, and increasingly also for consumers. In Northeast Thailand, the Alternative Agriculture Network Isan (AAN Isan) is struggling to secure income and subsistence agriculture for its members. This is achieved through a number of activities, some of which are introduced here in detail. Producer cooperatives, organic farming, green markets, or a local herb medicine center all aim at empowerment within the present market situation by using aspects of the health discourse to support their arguments and at the same time reinforcing a specific local politics of identity, rooted in notions of culture and religion.

T1  - Governing fair trade coffee supply: dynamics and challenges in small farmers' organizations
AN  - 1667352820; 4659063
AB  - Farmers' organizations are essential actors in fair trade certification schemes, and therefore in delivering their associated benefits for poor small-scale farmers. However, the dynamics and challenges faced by these cooperative organizations have been largely bypassed in the fair trade literature. In this context, this paper aims to unpack the multiple, coexisting and interwoven marketing channels available for small-scale coffee producers, unveiling potential sources of uncertainty and tensions among competing actors and interests, and identifying and assessing the strategies used by organizations to influence farmers' marketing decisions. The analysis comprises two case studies based in the department of Huehuetenango (Guatemala), where the existence of distinct marketing channels combines with processes of product differentiation, namely organic production. Results show the limitations of standard fair trade mechanisms to secure farmers' engagement with cooperative organizations. Rather, technical advice to improve farming practices and quality construction seem to be a more effective mechanism to govern this collective supply chain. Nevertheless, these strategies could be further constrained by productive and organizational factors, affecting the sustainability of potential benefits delivered by these key collective actors.

T1  - DEVELOPMENT AID, AGRICULTURAL VALUE CHAINS AND FARMERS' BENEFITS: THE CASE OF VANILLA GROWERS IN KASESE, UGANDA
AN  - 1663322575
AB  - This article assesses farmers' benefits from a donor-funded programme that promoted non-traditional agricultural export crops, specifically vanilla and hot pepper. Data was obtained from a survey of 125 farmers from eight farmers' associations working with a Dutch NGO and trading company, four focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Kasese Smallholder Income and Investment Programme used a value chain approach helping farmers at various stages. Farmers benefited from input loans, agricultural skills, extension services and a market for their produce. Vanilla producers were affected by the persistent drop in the crop prices, which affected the sustainability of associations beyond the Kasese Smallholder Income and Investment Programme. Stronger farmers' associations will give more benefits; the government should therefore promote a nationwide cooperative movement and crop regulatory authorities so as to be able to help farmers sustainability.

T1  - Smallholder vegetable growers should seek high value market opportunities
AN  - 1639641917
AB  - In Africa, most smallholder farmers produce vegetables during the rains, when every other farmer does the same. The result is oversupply in the wet season and scarcity in the dry season, leading to low income for farmers and high prices for consumers. To encourage farmers to change their mindset and behaviour, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research funded project "Improving income and nutrition in Eastern and Southern Africa by enhancing vegetable-based farming and food systems in peri-urban corridors" recently held a training course for young farmers in Tanzania. The training was organised by HORTITengeru and The World Vegetable Centre Eastern and Southern Africa to equip famers with knowledge and skills on value chain thinking. Twenty female and male farmers age 18-35 from Maweni Village, Arusha participated. Value chain thinking places the needs of consumers and customers first, and aims to build lasting relationships among chain actors to meet those needs.

T1  - Contingent spaces for smallholder participation in GlobalGAP: insights from Kenyan horticulture value chains
AN  - 1636197596
AB  - Private standards initiatives (PSIs) in agri-food value chains raise questions of democratic governance and accountability relating to the voice and agency of those whom the standards are designed to benefit or whom they most affect. We employ the concept of 'spaces for participation' to analyse participation in a particular PSI, GlobalGAP, and assess how, and to what extent, it opens up a space for debate about what constitutes good practice in agri-food chains and for whom. We draw on focus groups with smallholders, together with semi-structured interviews and workshops held with actors at the national and international scales to examine PSIs operating in Kenyan export horticulture to examine good agricultural practice (GAP) standards. Our analysis suggests that despite public announcements that these initiatives promote the voice of the farmer, the direct participation of farmers is largely absent from these policy spaces at present. This is related to the way in which invitations to the spaces for participation are constructed, what is deemed to be appropriate subjects for discussion in PSIs as well as the practical challenges associated with the organisation of farmers across spatial scales. The spaces for participation are located largely at the international and national scales with few connections to the local scale. This paper contributes to an extension of value chain analysis that re-asserts the importance of institutional context and how value chains are embedded in particular socio-economic and political systems.

T1  - Jatropha Developments in Mozambique: Analysis of Structural Conditions Influencing Niche-Regime Interactions
AN  - 1635733159
AB  - This article investigates the transition dynamics related to Jatropha developments in Mozambique. The analysis focuses on how structural conditions (infrastructure, institutions, interaction and collaboration and capabilities and resources) enable or constrain interactions between niche-level Jatropha experiments and incumbent energy, agriculture and rural development regimes in Mozambique. Investors in agro-industrial Jatropha projects focused on establishing projects in areas with relatively good infrastructure, rather than in remote rural areas. Furthermore, they predominantly focused on Jatropha production instead of investing in the entire Jatropha value chain, which turned out to be a challenge in itself, as growing a productive Jatropha crop was much more complex than initially anticipated. The development of institutions that could nurture and protect Jatropha projects from the prevailing regimes lagged behind Jatropha project establishment, leading to an insecure investment climate. Strong inter-ministerial collaboration and organized civil society interaction and representation contrasted with non-organized private sector and rather isolated smallholder Jatropha projects. The global financial crisis and limited adaptive capacity reduced the time and space for experimentation and learning to overcome disappointing crop performance. Together, this hampered Jatropha's potential to challenge the energy, agricultural and rural development regimes. Nevertheless, the Jatropha experience did initiate the development of policy and regulation and stimulated interaction and collaboration between specific groups of stakeholders, which could provide the basis to capture future biofuel momentum in Mozambique.

T1  - ECONOMICS OF DAIRY FARMING IN TURKEY
AN  - 1672598665
AB  - In this study dairy farming activities in Turkey are employed to prove that small-scale agricultural production is disappearing rapidly due to costly investment and mechanization needs. For that purpose the cost structure and the investment needs in starting a dairy farm are analyzed. The results show that the capital requirements of building a dairy farm with optimal capacity are hard to reach for small farmers unless a system of marketing and production agricultural cooperatives and/or institutions are organized.

T1  - Civil Society in Hybrid Governance: Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) Legitimacy in Mediating Wal-Mart's Local Produce Supply Chains in Honduras
AN  - 1624896837
AB  - This paper challenges the notion that the incorporation of actors from civil society into hybrid governance arrangements improves outcomes and legitimacy. Multi-stakeholder collaborations are a popular hybrid governance approach to development, including NGOs' work to integrate smallholder farmers into supermarket supply chains. As a result, NGOs' service provision role has expanded to include market facilitation, often necessitating NGOs act as market intermediaries. This paper explores how this new role may jeopardize NGOs' organizational legitimacy in the eyes of their constituents, other development organizations, and supermarket partners, and therefore ultimately affect their ability to represent civil society in hybrid governance arrangements. Drawing on qualitative data collected in the Central American country of Honduras, this paper focuses on NGOs' role organizing producer associations to facilitate access to Wal-Mart supermarkets. Findings suggest that a lack of supply chain transparency, NGOs' negotiation between commercial and aid-oriented goals, and the potential to exclude producers from development projects threaten NGOs' legitimacy. These findings illustrate the difficulties of embedding philanthropic activities in market-based systems, and demonstrate how multi-stakeholder collaborations may be influenced more by commercial priorities than the elements of a partnership. Ultimately, development NGOs are products of neoliberal, hybrid governance, even as their activities are expected to ease the transition of small-scale producers into this system.

T1  - Biofuels for a Greener Economy? Insights from Jatropha Production in Northeastern Ethiopia
AN  - 1615947617
AB  - Many observers view Jatropha as a miracle plant that grows in harsh environments, halts land degradation and provides seeds for fuel production. This makes it particularly attractive for use in Ethiopia, where poverty levels are high and the degradation of agricultural land is widespread. In this article, we investigate the potentials and limitations of a government-initiated Jatropha project for smallholders in northeastern Ethiopia from a green economy perspective. Data are based on a 2009 household survey and interviews with key informants, as well as on a 2012 follow-up round of interviews with key informants. We conclude that the project has not contributed to a greener economy so far, but has the potential to do so in the future. To maximize Jatropha's potential, interventions must focus mainly on smallholders and pay more attention to the entire biofuel value chain.

T1  - Chained to Development? Livelihoods and global value chains in the coffee-producing Toraja region of Indonesia
AN  - 1555409103
AB  - A popular rural development strategy in recent years has been through the adoption of what has been widely called a 'value chain approach', where improved linkages between small producers in underdeveloped rural communities and 'lead firms' constitute the foundations for development interventions. Whilst the global value-chain framework can deliver insights into the broad structural processes shaping livelihood possibilities, the adoption of value chains as a development strategy tends to disregard the complexity of smallholder livelihoods that shape poverty alleviation pathways in different contexts. The relationships between global value chains, development interventions, and rural livelihoods are explored in this article through a case study of smallholder coffee farming in the Toraja region of Indonesia. In this case, value-chain interventions in the coffee sector are unlikely to significantly contribute to improved rural welfare due to the diversified reality of local livelihoods, the nuances of how coffee production is embedded within Torajan culture and economy, and excellent prevailing market opportunities. The livelihood framework, therefore, provides an important corrective for the sometimes excessive optimism presented by advocates of a value-chain approach to rural development.

T1  - Farmer Strategies for Dealing with Climatic Variability: A Case Study from the Mixteca Alta Region of Oaxaca, Mexico
AN  - 1541795249
AB  - This study describes an interdisciplinary methodology for helping small farmers prepare for climatic variability. We facilitated workshops in the Mixteca Alta region of Oaxaca, Mexico, in which groups of small farmers described how they had adapted to and prepared for past climate challenges. Farmers reported that their cropping systems were changing for multiple reasons: more drought, later rainfall onset, decreased rural labor, and introduced labor-saving technologies. Examination of climate data found that farmers' climate narratives were largely consistent with the observational record. There have been increases in temperature and rainfall intensity, and an increase in rainfall seasonality that may be perceived as later rainfall onset. Farmers also identified 14 indicators that they subsequently used to evaluate the condition of their agroecosystems. Farmers ranked landscape-scale indicators as more marginal than farmer management or soil quality indicators. From this analysis, farmers proposed strategies to improve the ability of their agroecosystems to cope with climatic variability. Notably, they recognized that social organizing and education are required for landscape-scale indicators to be improved. This outcome suggests that climate change adaptation by small farmers involves much more than just a set of farming practices, but also community action to tackle collective problems.

T1  - Between land grabbing and farmers' benefits: land transfers in West Kalimantan, Indonesia
AN  - 1548783218; 4583870
AB  - Rapid growth of oil palm cultivation in West Kalimantan, Indonesia has increased both the pace and size of land transfers from farmers to big companies and city-based investors. This process has been widely conceptualised as "top-down land grabbing" but this perspective largely neglects the agency of the farmers. This paper seeks to shed light on the agency of farmers with respect to how they respond to land transfer schemes. Through a study of land transfers under nucleus estate schemes (NES), schemes that were introduced by the Indonesian government in which smallholding farms are integrated parts of a modern, large size plantation company, we will show that agrarian dynamics are shaped by notions of what is "fair" and "just".

T1  - Governance Strategies and Welfare Effects: Vertical Integration and Contracts in the Catfish Sector in Vietnam
AN  - 1660024653; 201506214
AB  - Using an original dataset from the Vietnamese catfish sector, we study the impact of vertical coordination options on household welfare and the implications of different stages of vertical coordination for the success of the whole sector. The welfare gain from contract farming and employment on processor-owned estate farms is estimated using a maximum simulated likelihood estimator. Our results show positive welfare effects from participating in contract farming, but not from employment on processor-owned estate farms. The results imply that contract farming presents opportunities for economic growth, but additional effort is required to make the contracts more accessible to smallholders. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The effect of Banana Xanthomonas Wilt on beer-banana value chains in central Uganda
AN  - 2117412399
AB  - Purpose – Beer-bananas in Central Uganda are important for smallholder farmers’ livelihoods, especially for those that process the banana into beer and spirits. The purpose of this paper is to understand how actors in the beer-banana value chain are affected and how they are managing disease has become an important issue since the outbreak of the bacterial banana disease Xanthomonas Wilt. Design/methodology/approach – The authors conducted an exploratory study focusing on producers of beer-bananas; brewers and non-brewers, and on retailers in Central Uganda and in Kampala. The authors conducted surveys with these value chain actors and we used baseline data, collected through a household survey in the project sites. Findings – Results showed that Banana Xanthomonas Wilt (BXW) has drastically reduced productivity of beer-banana systems, resulting in reduced sales volumes of beer-bananas and processed products and consequently reduced incomes. Application of disease control measures was generally higher among those farmers that brew. Research limitations/implications – This being an exploratory study, the samples for the different value chain actors were rather small. Future research should address: product quality and opportunities for differentiation; effects of beer-banana processing on rural communities; adoption of BXW control measures. Originality/value – Beer-bananas are often neglected in research; this paper shows that is unfounded since beer-banana production and processing are important for many people’s livelihood. More insight into what motivates farmers to control the disease is essential to protect these people’s livelihoods.

T1  - Factors influencing willingness to participate in multi-stakeholder platform by smallholder farmers in Northern Ghana: implication for research and development
AN  - 1754639833
AB  - Innovation platforms are established to facilitate open communication and collaboration among various actors usually within a value chain to promote collective resource management. The concept of innovation platform as a strategy of entry point for operationalization, validation and dissemination of agricultural technology have received much attention in recent times among researchers in Ghana. However, very limited information exists on the factors that influence willingness of farmers' participation. The present study identified the factors influencing willingness to participate in innovation platform and also tested the level of agreement among the identified constraints associated with participation using the Probit model and Kendall's coefficient of concordance respectively. Data for the study was collected from a cross sectional primary observations of 250 smallholder rice farmers in northern Ghana. The study observes, inter alia, that age of household head, household size and household income significantly influenced willingness to participate on the platform. The Kendall's coefficient of concordance value indicated that there was 21 percent agreement between the rankings of the participation constraints faced by the sampled rice farmers. Income-earning and younger household heads must be targeted coupled with situation of the platforms close to smallholder farmers to encourage participation.

T1  - Directing the Credit for Agricultural Growth in Jammu & Kashmir
AN  - 1680384759
AB  - Jammu and Kashmir is a hill state having majority of farmers falling under marginal and small holding categories. Diffusion of modern agricultural techniques and practices to the farmers by way of strengthening and activating the extension machinery can go a long way in improving the situation. This adoption of new technologies depends largely on the state of infrastructure and resources available with the farmers. Therefore credit is an important input for maintaining resources to improve agriculture at local level. However, both the Government and the financial institutions are taking several steps to enhance the credit flow to agriculture. During the past few years significant progressive changes have taken place in banking and financial structure of Jammu and Kashmir. The growth of commercial banks and co-operative credit societies has been really spectacular. The Banks have played a crucial role in the mobilization of savings and Investment. Bank credit to productive sectors of the economy has a critical role in sustaining the growth process. Banking structure in J&K consists of Commercial Banks, Regional Rural Banks and Cooperative Banks. At the end of December 2008, the state was served by 944 bank branches of all Scheduled Commercial Banks. Average population per bank is 13 thousand in J&K state compared to average 15 thousand in the country. The biggest challenge in respect of credit is the smooth flow of credit in the beginning of the cropping season for the farming community with a guaranteed minimum price support. Kissan Credit Card scheme is implemented in the state with that objective and the number of farmers cover under the scheme is increasing (1,24,365 distributed in 2012). Future reforms in credit availability of farmers of state would require for agro-economic development at both micro and macro level, to strengthen the farm business in hills and remote districts of the state for achieving overall well being of the farming society.

T1  - Chained to development? Livelihoods and global value chains in the coffee-producing Toraja region of Indonesia
AN  - 1562144974; 4597649
AB  - A popular rural development strategy in recent years has been through the adoption of what has been widely called a 'value chain approach', where improved linkages between small producers in underdeveloped rural communities and 'lead firms' constitute the foundations for development interventions. Whilst the global value-chain framework can deliver insights into the broad structural processes shaping livelihood possibilities, the adoption of value chains as a development strategy tends to disregard the complexity of smallholder livelihoods that shape poverty alleviation pathways in different contexts. The relationships between global value chains, development interventions, and rural livelihoods are explored in this article through a case study of smallholder coffee farming in the Toraja region of Indonesia. In this case, value-chain interventions in the coffee sector are unlikely to significantly contribute to improved rural welfare due to the diversified reality of local livelihoods, the nuances of how coffee production is embedded within Torajan culture and economy, and excellent prevailing market opportunities. The livelihood framework, therefore, provides an important corrective for the sometimes excessive optimism presented by advocates of a value-chain approach to rural development.

T1  - A Comparative Value Chain Analysis of Smallholder Burley Tobacco Production in Malawi -- 2003/4 and 2009/10
AN  - 1559004749; 201432911
AB  - Smallholders grow the majority of Malawi's main export crop -- burley tobacco. We analyse this value chain segment for the 2003/4 and 2009/10 seasons. The comparison shows smallholder profits in 2003/4 were limited by two main factors: a cartel of leaf merchants at auction and inefficient marketing arrangements. In 2009/10, there was greater competition at auction, improvements in marketing, tighter state regulation (including minimum prices) and much more contract farming. The paper concludes by reflecting on aspects of the political economy of the tobacco industry at national and global levels. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Using an original dataset from the Vietnamese catfish sector, we study the impact of vertical coordination options on household welfare and the implications of different stages of vertical coordination for the success of the whole sector. The welfare gain from contract farming and employment on processor-owned estate farms is estimated using a maximum simulated likelihood estimator. Our results show positive welfare effects from participating in contract farming, but not from employment on processor- owned estate farms. The results imply that contract farming presents opportunities for economic growth, but additional effort is required to make the contracts more accessible to smallholders.

T1  - DETERMINANTS OF SMALL SCALE DAIRY SHEEP PRODUCERS' DECISIONS TO USE MIDDLEMEN FOR ACCESSING MARKETS AND GETTING LOANS IN DRY MARGINAL AREAS IN SYRIA
AN  - 1535016850
AB  - SUMMARY

              
The paper describes value chain actors and institutional arrangements along value chains, and identifies major determinants of farmers' decision making to work with middlemen/traders 'jabbans' (or cheese makers), and based on those identify short implications for research, development and policy processes. We hypothesize that small-scale sheep producers are more dependent on middlemen for market and loans than larger holders, leading to welfare losses. Our empirical findings based on a Heckman model applied for 120 farming households conducted in Khanasser region (Syria) show that despite unequal benefits, local arrangements are more blessing than curse for the poor. Small-scale sheep producers and middlemen developed intricate institutional arrangements that are mutually beneficial. Producers act collectively to pool sufficient quantity of milk to be attractive to traders (jabban) while gaining access to market and cash loans mainly for feed. This provides the middlemen needed supplies with reduced transaction costs. This suggests that development organizations should support local capacity of producing organizations to work together, small-scale producers to organize, develop small scale dairy processing workshops for pooling and possibly processing milk, support training for direct market access and facilitate access to loans. Finally, supporting organizations such as rural financial services and micro-finance need to ensure up-to-date market information is available to ensure fair prices are paid. They should also be able to negotiate favourable conditions for loans and reach out to these resource-poor rural populations where formal credit systems are absent. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - As China Returns: Perceptions of Land Grabbing and Spatial Power Relations in Mozambique
AN  - 1700674655; 201526259
AB  - This article investigates how perceptions of China in Mozambican civil society are affected by entrepreneurial activity and bilateral cooperation between China and Mozambique - real, imagined, visible and legal as well as clandestine and illegal in the agricultural and forestry sectors. The research problem concerns how discourse on Chinese investors is formed in Mozambique. Two questions are posed. How does Mozambican civil society perceive their room to maneuver at a time of Chinese growing economic interest and 'return' to Africa? What views exist on the policy space for the national government? Using qualitative ethnographic interviews to answer these overarching questions about expanding/contracting maneuvering space, this article explains how Mozambique's largest social group - peasants - the National Association of Small Farmers (UNAC) and other societal actors perceive Chinese investors. Informed by theoretical debates on civil society, the article argues that coinciding with China's large-scale return to Africa, an already tense dynamic between civil society and the state is picking up speed. It is argued that this phenomenon is likely to have more to do with African governments accruing more power and policy space than through direct impact of Chinese economic activity on African social life. However, to avoid negative discourse formation, China and host governments need to become more open on and transparent about bilateral agreements.

T1  - Determinants of producers' participation in gums and resins value chains from dry forests and analysis of marketing channels in northwestern and southern Ethiopia
AN  - 1682244318
AB  - Using data gathered from market actors and 384 households, factors influencing the participation of producers in gum and resins chains were identified. Participation is constrained mainly by low product prices, limited access rights to forests, and lack of information on product quality and prices. Regional differences exist regarding access rights to forests and the chains. In northwestern Ethiopia, factors positively influencing participation were the gender of the household head, whether advice was provided by extension workers, and the level of farm income and farm size, indicating that poor people have lesser access to gums and resins. Access to formal credit and perceptions of problems of transport negatively and significantly affect participation. In southern Ethiopia, participation was positively influenced by the number of livestock owned, while distance to the forest and perception of transport problems had negative effects. Two major value chains and eight major marketing channels were identified. Profit margins varied between 12% and 28% for producers and between 14% and 53% for exporters. Improving access to and use of dry forests for gums and resins, encouraging sustained involvement of companies, and building capacity to add value are measures recommended to enhance incentives for collectors to responsibly manage dry forests.

T1  - Improving smallholders' participation in tree product value chains: experiences from the Congo Basin
AN  - 1682243744
AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing use of the value chain approach as a strategy to improve smallholder participation in markets. Despite the surge, not much is known about its effectiveness and specificity in the context of lesser known commodities such as non-timber forest products and agroforestry tree products. This paper documents the key lessons learned from the implementation of two major value chain projects related to lesser known species in the Congo basin, specifically in Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Results from the project indicate the importance of combining value chain interventions in the domain of production, harvest and post-harvest, with activities that enhance the organisational and institutional environment, promote effective policies to support the commercialisation process, as well as assessing the impact of the interventions. It is recommended that in order to exploit the benefits of agroforestry value chains, it is important to take advantage of complementarities among value chain interventions, use differentiated strategies in order to reach out to the various target groups, understand the product and country specific issues to design interventions as well as promote effective policy environment that will improve domestication and planting of these species. It is concluded that the value chain approach has the potential to enhance smallholder participation in agroforestry products' markets, thereby improving their livelihoods.

T1  - A Study on Circulation Modes of Agricultural Products in Fujian Province
AN  - 1617952950
AB  - In the long time, one of the bottlenecks that have restricted the development of agricultural products in Fujian is the contradiction between "small farmers" and "big markets", which is also a main result of the backward of circulation pattern for agricultural products. Relatively backward of circulation pattern is the significant factor leading to bad sales of agricultural products, slow increasing of farmers' income and so on. In regard to the phenomenon of unmarketable sales, lower price, higher output without higher income etc., the key point is the creation of current produce flow model, in order to improve the circulation performance of agricultural products as well as solve the conflict between "small farmers" and "big markets". First, here we analyze the current produce flow model. Second, research the problems that lying in the model. Finally, we come up with a suggestion based on TPL and its implementation.

T1  - 'Control Grabbing' and small-scale agricultural intensification: emerging patterns of state-facilitated 'agricultural investment' in Rwanda
AN  - 1660020259; 201506903
AB  - The Rwandan government's ongoing reconfiguration of the agricultural sector seeks to facilitate increased penetration of smallholder farming systems by domestic and international capital, which may include some land acquisition ('land grabbing') as well as contract farming arrangements. Such contracts are arranged by the state, which sometimes uses coercive mechanisms and interventionist strategies to encourage agricultural investment. The Rwandan government has adapted neo-liberal tools, such as 'performance management contracts', which make local public administrators accountable for agricultural development targets (often explicitly linked to corporate interests). Activities of international development agencies are becoming intertwined with those of the state and foreign capital, so that a variety of actors and objectives are starting to collaboratively change the relations between land and labour. The global 'land grab' is only one aspect of broader patterns of reconfiguration of control over land, labour and markets in the Global South. This paper demonstrates the ways in which the state is orienting public resources towards private interests in Rwanda, through processes that have elsewhere been termed 'control grabbing' [Borras et al. 2012, 402-416]. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Control Grabbing' and small-scale agricultural intensification: emerging patterns of state-facilitated 'agricultural investment' in Rwanda
AN  - 1660017489; 201504319
AB  - The Rwandan government's ongoing reconfiguration of the agricultural sector seeks to facilitate increased penetration of smallholder farming systems by domestic and international capital, which may include some land acquisition ('land grabbing') as well as contract farming arrangements. Such contracts are arranged by the state, which sometimes uses coercive mechanisms and interventionist strategies to encourage agricultural investment. The Rwandan government has adapted neo-liberal tools, such as 'performance management contracts', which make local public administrators accountable for agricultural development targets (often explicitly linked to corporate interests). Activities of international development agencies are becoming intertwined with those of the state and foreign capital, so that a variety of actors and objectives are starting to collaboratively change the relations between land and labour. The global 'land grab' is only one aspect of broader patterns of reconfiguration of control over land, labour and markets in the Global South. This paper demonstrates the ways in which the state is orienting public resources towards private interests in Rwanda, through processes that have elsewhere been termed 'control grabbing' [Borras et al. 2012, 402-416].

T1  - Farmer cooperatives are the missing link to meet market demands in Laos
AN  - 1735659141; 2011-711278
AB  - In the transition from subsistence to commercial agriculture, smallholders in Lao PDR need to get better organised to match market demand in terms of product volume and quality. This paper investigates the conditions for the emergence of cooperatives from existing farmers' groups. Our study revealed the importance of social networks and power relations as a factor of cohesion within groups. Local leadership plays a crucial role in connecting group members to the village and district institutions. Recommendations are provided to improve group management rules as a pre-requisite to turn groups into farmers' cooperatives. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Changing Relations of Production in Chinese Agriculture from Decollectivization to Capitalism
AN  - 1963079413
AB  - This article contributes to the study of capitalist transformation of Chinese agriculture in recent decades by making five main arguments. Firstly, it argues that consecutive land tenure reforms since 1978 have primarily intended to promote capitalist agriculture by making land transfers from smallholders to larger farmers and agribusiness companies increasingly easier. Secondly, in contrast to the conventional wisdom that incomplete property rights on land constrains capital accumulation in agriculture, this article suggests that semi-private landownership has actually played a supportive role in this process. Thirdly, it identifies the roots of capitalist agriculture in the early years of decollectivization where some individual farmers managed to transform themselves to capitalist farmers by increasing their scale of production through acquiring more means of production. Fourthly, as the limitations of this "American path" of capitalist development from below became clear in the 1990s, the "agribusiness path" of vertical integration of the agricultural sector by the urban capital became the dominant developmental pattern and policy paradigm in China. Finally, contrary to the studies which present farmer cooperatives as embodying an alternative to capitalist agriculture, this article suggests that many of the farmer cooperatives in contemporary china are company-like cooperatives that are not very different from agribusiness companies in terms of shareholding and decision making structures, as well as the production relations they facilitate.

T1  - Use of Blue-Greenish Yellow Fluorescence Test on Feeds and Its Association with Aflatoxin M^sub 1^ Contamination in Bulk Tank Milk
AN  - 1498090221; 24490923
AB  - The objectives of this study were to use the blue-greenish yellow fluorescence (BY) test for aflatoxin M^sub 1^ (AFM1) contamination in bulk milk and to examine the association between AFM1 contamination and environmental and feed management factors. The study was conducted March to May of 2011 with samples from 82 small holder dairy farms belonging to a single dairy cooperative in Chiang Mai province, Thailand. On the day of milk sample collection, samples of all feed used for milking cows and data on feed characteristics, feed management, and environmental factors also were collected at each farm. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine AFM1 concentrations in milk samples, and samples with AFM1 concentrations above the limit of detection were considered AFM1 contaminated. Fisher's exact tests were used to determine the association between AFM1 contamination in milk and farm management factors, feed management factors, and fungal contamination in feeds (as determined with the BY test). A multilevel logistic regression model was used to create the final model of factors associated with AFM1 contamination in milk. Feeds with fungal contamination (as determined by the BY test), high levels of cracked particles of commercial concentrate pellets, sunlight in the feed storage room, storage of commercial concentrates on the farm for more than 1 month, and more than 5% difference in relative humidity between the feed storage room and the barn holding lactating cows were associated with AFM1 contamination in milk. The BY test was useful for screening cattle feed for fungal contamination, and the results of this test in conjunction with other factors can be used to monitor and prevent AFM1 contamination in milk on small holder dairy farms.

T1  - Can Producer Associations Improve Rural Livelihoods? Evidence from Farmer Centres in India
AN  - 1520336703; 201415378
AB  - Rural producer associations are considered a potential community-driven solution to the problems of smallholder agriculture. This article evaluates the impact of organising female farmers into producer associations in Gujarat, India. The initiative provided training, information, access to inputs, risk mitigation, and market linkages. Over 18 months, the programme weakly increased members' non-farm income and access to output markets. It had stronger impacts on members' awareness and utilisation of financial services. Impacts were heterogeneous, varying by pre-existing socioeconomic conditions. These findings suggest that producer associations can lower transaction costs for smallholders, but that poverty alleviation may be a longer-term prospect. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Rural Development Strategies and Government Roles in the Development of Farmers' Cooperatives in China
AN  - 2057554884
AB  - In an effort to address the growing income disparities between rural and urban residents in China, Chinese authorities introduced a series of rural development policies beginning in 2002 that established as a national goal a xiaokang (all around better off) society and gave top priority to the triad of agriculture, rural areas, and farmers. Farmers' cooperatives, consequently, have received substantial government support since 2002 as they are viewed as an important institution for linking small-scale producers to agro-food supply chains, and particularly value-added food chains. Yet little is understood regarding how and to what extent farmers' cooperatives have benefited members and contributed to rural development in China. Using a case study method and in-depth interviews, we evaluated three successful farmers' cooperatives in China. Following the "deepening-broadening-regrounding" typology proposed by van der Ploeg, Long, and Banks (2002), we found that the farmers' professional cooperatives can make important economic, social, and environmental contributions to rural development by adopting alternative strategies and activities. On the other hand, these cooperatives also face great challenges for further development, including limited access to land and capital, a massive loss of laborers, low market competitiveness, weak internal management, and limited government support, which explains why cooperatives are not more widespread in China. This paper offers new insights into the roles of farmers' cooperatives and government in rural development.

T1  - Framing smallholder inclusion in global value chains - case studies from India and West Africa
AN  - 1756619354
AB  - A resurrected interest in agriculture has brought in its wake growing interest in smallholders in the global South by scholars, companies, governments and development agencies alike. While non-governmental organisations and development agencies see the potential to reduce poverty, companies look upon smallholder agriculture as a widely untapped resource for the sourcing of crops and as a sales market for agricultural inputs. While the important role of large corporate buyers of agricultural produce as lead firms in value chains is often discussed and emphasised, the power of providers of technology and agricultural inputs is being rather neglected. In this paper, we analyse two case studies of technology and input providers in agricultural value chains and their role in smallholder inclusion with the aim of finding out how such companies impact the governance of the value chains. To do so we combine insights from the value chain literature with the concept of framing/overflowing.

T1  - Value chain approaches to development: Smallholder farmer perceptions of risk and benefits across three cocoa chains in Ghana
AN  - 1536600899
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to look at the ever-popular, "value-chain approach" for linking smallholder farmers to high value export markets. Conventional wisdom says that value chains undertaken for development purposes redistribute risk and provide benefits and services to participants that are otherwise difficult or impossible to obtain. The authors take a farmer-centric approach and ask farmers participating in these higher value chains if they perceive greater, or different risks and compare results to their conventional counterparts. The authors also ask what benefits they associate with participation and if they believe they believe those benefits are exclusive to value chain participation. Design/methodology/approach - The authors collect data from growers in three different cocoa value chains in Ashanti, Ghana. These chains include one focussed on certified production practices (Rainforest Alliance), one that focussed on high-value product characteristics (Fine Flavor) and a conventional chain, which serves as counterfactual. Findings - The paper finds differences in perceptions of participation risks and benefits - particularly among price risks - that appear to filter based on value chain membership. However, for many risks, value chain participation seems to do little to redistribute potential production shocks. With some exceptions, growers report that many of the benefits they enjoy as a result of participation could feasibly be accessed by other sources. Research limitations/implications - The limitations of this paper are related to sample size. This was managed from a statistical perspective. Social implications - The authors explore how these results might impact the sustainability of the value chain approach and encourage donors and development agencies to be thoughtful and critical about measuring how farmers perceive new market opportunities. Originality/value - The authors believe that this is the first paper prepared to critically investigate the perceived benefits of value chains.

T1  - Can producer associations improve rural livelihoods? Evidence from farmer centres in India
AN  - 1504159517; 4534884
AB  - Rural producer associations are considered a potential community-driven solution to the problems of smallholder agriculture. This article evaluates the impact of organising female farmers into producer associations in Gujarat, India. The initiative provided training, information, access to inputs, risk mitigation, and market linkages. Over 18 months, the programme weakly increased members' non-farm income and access to output markets. It had stronger impacts on members' awareness and utilisation of financial services. Impacts were heterogeneous, varying by pre-existing socioeconomic conditions. These findings suggest that producer associations can lower transaction costs for smallholders, but that poverty alleviation may be a longer-term prospect. Reprinted by permission of Frank Cass & Co.

T1  - Measuring the Benefits of Smallholder Farmer Membership in Producer-Controlled Vertical Value Chains: Survey Findings From a Development Project in East Africa
AN  - 1766838003
AB  - The question addressed in this article is what precisely are the benefits that small-scale farmers in the developing world receive from being members of producer-controlled vertical value chains? A baseline comparative survey was conducted of members and non-members of four vertically coordinated dairy cooperatives, three in Kenya and one in Uganda (N=3,986), which are part of a larger five-year longitudinal cooperative study. The study measures both objective income gains and subjective satisfaction gains from cooperative membership. Cooperative members have a small but statistically significant advantage over non-members in income from dairy, but other incentives for membership are based on selective incentives (i.e., provision of non-income services to members) and social capital (i.e., trust that the cooperative will purchase their milk and pay them a fair price). These findings suggest that the motivations for cooperative membership in developing countries are not dissimilar from motivations of cooperative members in more developed countries. This coupled with similar organizational design issues suggests that greater attention should be paid to larger-scale vertically coordinated collective action models in development theory and research.

T1  - 'People, Planet & Profit': Consumer-Oriented Hegemony and Power Relations in Palm Oil and Agrofuel Certification
AN  - 1622289382; 2011-702141
AB  - Palm oil comprises the fastest growing monoculture in the world and is used for food, cosmetics, and agrofuels. This article analyzes the attempts to guarantee the sustainable production of palm oil and agrofuels through voluntary certification schemes such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) from a critical state and hegemony theory perspective. Rather than seeing the RSPO as a voluntary and nongovernmental instrument that represents the interests of all concerned stakeholders equally, I analyze the roundtable as part of a transnational network state that is characterized by strategic selectivities, that is, some interests and strategies are privileged over others. Based on expert interviews in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore and the analysis of primary documents I conclude that the RSPO privileges business interests in general and export-oriented palm oil companies and downstream industries along the value chain in particular, whereas smallholders, plantation workers, and indigenous peoples are marginalized through different structures and processes, contributing to an actual depoliticization of socioecological conflicts.

T1  - Do private standards create exclusive supply chains? New evidence from the Peruvian asparagus export sector
AN  - 1519504190; 4553854
AB  - Developing countries are increasingly exporting fresh horticultural products to high-income countries. These exports increasingly have to comply with stringent public and private standards, as well as other quality and safety issues. There is an ongoing debate on the effect of private standards on the inclusion of small-scale farmers in export supply chains. With this paper, we contribute to this debate by providing new evidence from the Peruvian asparagus export sector, and by addressing several important methodological shortcomings and gaps in the existing literature. We describe export dynamics using a unique firm level dataset on 567 asparagus export firms from 1993 to 2011 and the evolution of certification to private standards using own survey data from a stratified random sample of 87 export firms. We use an unbalanced panel of the surveyed companies on 19 years and several methods, including fixed effects and GMM estimators, to estimate the causal impact of certification to private standards on companies' sourcing strategy. We find that certification leads to vertical integration and significantly reduces the share of produce that is sourced from external producers, with a larger effect for small-scale producers. When distinguishing between production and processing standards, and between low-level and high-level standards, we find that especially high-level production standards have a negative impact on sourcing from (small-scale) producers.

Based on expert interviews in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore and the analysis of primary documents I conclude that the RSPO privileges business interests in general and export-oriented palm oil companies and downstream industries along the value chain in particular, whereas smallholders, plantation workers, and indigenous peoples are marginalized through different structures and processes, contributing to an actual depoliticization of socioecological conflicts.

T1  - Do private standards create exclusive supply chains? New evidence from the Peruvian asparagus export sector
AN  - 1466631666
AB  - Developing countries are increasingly exporting fresh horticultural products to high-income countries. These exports increasingly have to comply with stringent public and private standards, as well as other quality and safety issues. There is an ongoing debate on the effect of private standards on the inclusion of small-scale farmers in export supply chains. With this paper, we contribute to this debate by providing new evidence from the Peruvian asparagus export sector, and by addressing several important methodological shortcomings and gaps in the existing literature. We describe export dynamics using a unique firm level dataset on 567 asparagus export firms from 1993 to 2011 and the evolution of certification to private standards using own survey data from a stratified random sample of 87 export firms. We use an unbalanced panel of the surveyed companies on 19 years and several methods, including fixed effects and GMM estimators, to estimate the causal impact of certification to private standards on companies' sourcing strategy. We find that certification leads to vertical integration and significantly reduces the share of produce that is sourced from external producers, with a larger effect for small-scale producers. When distinguishing between production and processing standards, and between low-level and high-level standards, we find that especially high-level production standards have a negative impact on sourcing from (small-scale) producers.

T1  - Is Fairtrade in commercial farms justifiable? Its impact on commercial and small-scale producers in South Africa
AN  - 1461645210; 4504859
AB  - Fairtrade initially was limited to improving the lives of small-scale and peasant farmers, but later on it embraced commercial farmers, which attracted criticism. While there are a number of justifications for the Fairtrade organization's decision, there are authors who feel that meaningful 'fair trade' cannot be achieved with the inclusion of commercial farms. This paper investigates the impact of Fairtrade on commercial farms and small-scale farmer cooperatives in South Africa. Fairtrade on South African commercial farms embraces a number of policy concerns related to land reform, BEE and sustainable development. The results of the study show that when commercial farms are included in the Fairtrade model, communities in which these farmers live benefit from developmental projects. In addition, in some instances, farm workers gain shares in the commercial farms, and benefit from the farm owners' knowledge and capital.

T1  - Do intermediary institutions promote inclusiveness in PES programs? The case of Costa Rica
AN  - 1506423743; 4536473
AB  - Payments for environmental services (PES) are often promoted on the basis of a purported win-win scenario in terms of accomplishing dual environmental and social policy objectives. Yet, it has been observed that PES programs tend to exclude small land-owners due to relatively high and largely scale-independent transaction costs. This study seeks to shed light on the role of local intermediaries in PES programs and how they may bring the reality of PES closer to the win-win scenario. This is done through an investigation of three intermediaries in the Costa Rican PES program; an NGO, a producer cooperative, and a county agricultural center. Based on interviews, household surveys, and reviews of PES contracts, the study examines differences in the inclusion of small-holders in the PES program between the three organizations and focuses on understanding the underlying reasons for any observed differences. The results reveal that the cooperative and the agricultural center are more inclusive of small-holders than the NGO. The ability to include small-holders is influenced by the organizations' level of running operational costs, but also by their pre-existing portfolio of activities and relationships with landowners, as well as the land development history of the local area. Finally, the role of intermediaries is highly influenced by the framing of their working conditions by the PES program. This study thus shows the importance of considering the factors that condition the role of intermediaries in securing inclusive and low-cost provision of ES. All rights reserved, Elsevier

T1  - The value of domestic supply chains: producers, wholesalers, and urban consumers in Colombia
AN  - 1428511841; 4475151
AB  - Global value chains are potential links between smallholder farmers in developing countries and lucrative markets in industrialised nations. However, food access for poor consumers in Third World cities depends largely on traditional domestic supply chains. This article focuses on the market for perishables in Colombia, which is dominated by peasant farming and ranching, wholesale (spot) markets, and small, family-run corner stores and butchers. Here, evidence suggests that, despite characterisation of traditional supply chains as inefficient, they provide critical outlets for smallholders' heterogeneous production while simultaneously ensuring availability of cheap food for poor urban consumers.

T1  - Extending the margins of marketization: Frontier regions and the making of agro-export markets in northern Ghana
AN  - 1550994383; 2011-658863
AB  - This paper demonstrates how the global commodity chain approach has mutated from a critical tool for studying the production of inequality in the global economy to an instrument of development policy that extends the frontiers of marketization to so-called 'peripheries' in the Global South. Taking an outgrower scheme for the global production of organic mangoes in northern Ghana as point of departure, and situating this case study within the broader context of market experiments in the Ghanaian agricultural sector, it develops an account of global capitalism as a diverse, heterogeneous and messy arrangement of local borderlands. As a zone of inclusive exclusion these borderlands are brought into being by an economic discourse which separates the inside of the capitalist world from its supposed outside. The so-called integration of smallholders into global markets relies on exclusionary representations and the forging of new associations. First, economic practices in northern Ghana are portrayed by economists as defective and in doing so determine what lies outside the market. Second, within this 'outside' -- on which the 'inside' actually depends -- global capitalism mediated through the market models and rhetoric of international development organizations now literally touches the ground in specific geographical settings. Hence Frontier regions as represented by our case study bear the paradoxical character of the work of economics and are an instructive example for the performative power of economic theories. Marketization is revealed as a complex and socio-technically entangled process full of hidden prerequisites and unforeseen consequences that open up new social spaces of multiple ontological reconfigurations.

T1  - Fair trade governance and diversification: The experience of the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi
AN  - 1550994370; 2011-658780
AB  - This paper provides an empirical contribution to the theoretical debate concerning the impact of fair trade governance on the essential development processes of diversification and value chain upgrading. Two main positions currently shape this debate: one that argues the payment of 'above market' prices will promote reliance by Southern producers on low value agricultural production; another that fair trade might actually alleviate barriers to diversification and facilitate export opportunities. Responding to a lack of empirically grounded literature, the paper focuses on involvement by the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi (NASFAM) with two dedicated fair trade marketing networks. Based on qualitative case study research, analysis shows that dedicated fair trade organisations have played a significant role in promoting export diversification: particularly through the facilitation of market access and provision of the financial, social and physical capital needed to support such changes. Beyond this however, the study also highlights the importance and limitations of 'moral geographies' that permeate the construction of ethical credentials beneficial to the international marketing of Southern export producers in Northern consumer markets.

T1  - Private food standards, trade and institutions in Vietnam
AN  - 1559001938; 2011-646923
AB  - International horticulture markets are increasingly governed by transnational private regulations that create a new set of challenges not only for the market but also for local governance and policy regimes. Accordingly, resources from a range of international governance institutions and donors promoting development through neoliberal market rules have been directed towards ensuring that market entry barriers are not prohibitive. This paper presents the results of a recent study undertaken in Vietnam that assessed outcomes within a single value chain governed by GLOBALG.A.P, where technical and financial assistance were provided to smallholders. The constructivist approach highlights that, in addition to typical market entry barriers, additional obstacles existed that prevented smallholders from market participation. These were socially, culturally and historically situated and rooted in informal institutions. Failing to incorporate these into assistance planning may lead to the unequal distribution of development benefits associated with these changing market governance arrangements.

T1  - A political ecology of socio-economic differentiation: debt, inputs and liberalization reforms in southwestern Burkina Faso
AN  - 1531926054; 2011-565846
AB  - This paper builds on work from the agrarian change and political ecology literatures to analyze the process of agrarian change among smallholder cotton farmers in southwestern Burkina Faso. Specifically, we use a rural survey of 72 heads of household in three villages to examine whether and how (1) access to agricultural inputs, (2) debt and (3) liberalization reforms combine to produce rural socio-economic differentiation based on wealth. We find that wealthier farmers use more mineral fertilizer and manure inputs than their poorer counterparts. Wealthier farmers are also better able to remain debt-free as cotton prices drop and input prices rise. Moreover, they are able to take advantage of the neo-liberal restructuring of cotton cooperatives to change polices on debt repayment and input provisioning to their favor. This growing divide has large implications for rural food security, particularly as land becomes scarcer, fallows disappear and the need to intensify production grows. This research addresses two gaps in the agrarian change literature in relating how liberalization reforms and biophysical elements drive rural socio-economic differentiation. This work also shows that merging the concerns of political ecology with the agrarian change literature allows for a deeper examination of rural socio-economic differentiation.

T1  - Food safety and the political economy of food governance: the case of shrimp farming in Nam Dinh Province, Vietnam
AN  - 1520342627; 201417003
AB  - This contribution is a critique of the public and private governance models in response to the food safety crisis in Vietnam. Using shrimp farming in Nam Dinh province as a case study, the paper argues that public food governance has addressed some of the safety issues in the input sector but remains largely ineffective at the production level due to limited financial and human resources. In turn, private governance has had more successes but its impact is limited to the value-chain while food safety can be influenced by both sectoral and cross-sectoral production practices. In addition, it reinforces the subordination of direct producers by keeping them within industrial production, passing down the cost of safety compliance, and forcing them to assume production risks while reducing their profit margins. More importantly, safety governance under industrial farming is likely to open new opportunities for land expropriation and concentration, affecting the livelihood of small farmers and potentially leading to political unrest. The essay thus asserts that food safety needs to be addressed under the integrated framework of Food Sovereignty, which seeks to obtain food quality, including safety together with agroecological production, farmers' control of productive resources and the enabling of local trading systems.

T1  - Assessing the performance of a supply chain for organic vegetables from a smallholder perspective
AN  - 1449425116
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify factors that constrain marketing choices available to smallholders, limiting the chain's robustness from their perspective. Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on transaction cost economics to develop a model explaining dyadic relationships between smallholders and their buyers. The model was used to analyse a case study of the supply chain for organic fresh vegetables in Kathmandu, Nepal. Findings - This chain is characterised mainly by relational contracting between smallholders and their buyers. There was also evidence of vertical integration by some buyers, and of growers selling on informal markets. However, there was no evidence of spot market trading or of conventional contracting. These outcomes were attributed primarily to the absence effective standards and legal systems. Despite this, the chain offered smallholders a range of dyads with different risk-reward trade-offs. Research limitations/implications - This paper is based on the findings of a case study. While the results can be generalised to theory, they cannot be generalised to other supply chains. Originality/value - This study considers supply-chain performance from the perspective of smallholders. The model proposed for the study extends the traditional vertical coordination continuum to incorporate missing dyads and informal markets.

T1  - Private food standards, trade and institutions in Vietnam
AN  - 1443631205; 4493153
AB  - International horticulture markets are increasingly governed by transnational private regulations that create a new set of challenges not only for the market but also for local governance and policy regimes. Accordingly, resources from a range of international governance institutions and donors promoting development through neoliberal market rules have been directed towards ensuring that market entry barriers are not prohibitive. This paper presents the results of a recent study undertaken in Vietnam that assessed outcomes within a single value chain governed by GLOBALG.A.P, where technical and financial assistance were provided to smallholders. The constructivist approach highlights that, in addition to typical market entry barriers, additional obstacles existed that prevented smallholders from market participation. These were socially, culturally and historically situated and rooted in informal institutions. Failing to incorporate these into assistance planning may lead to the unequal distribution of development benefits associated with these changing market governance arrangements.

T1  - Value chains, partnerships and development: Using case studies to refine programme theories
AN  - 1442393081; 2013-25298-007
AB  - Partnerships between companies and non-governmental organizations that aim to incorporate smallholder farmers into value chains are increasingly being promoted as a way of pursuing development goals. This article investigates two case studies of such partnerships and the outcomes they achieved in order to refine the rationale underlying such interventions. In two case studies in Uganda and Rwanda, we documented the sequences of events within such partnership interventions, their context, and the intermediate outcomes, identified as the new rules and practices that generate institutional change. By portraying both the configuration of events within a partnership intervention and the contextual factors, these case studies reveal how the interventions produced outcomes that were situated in changing contexts, such as changes in market demand, government policy or business strategy. The research approach made it possible to disentangle partnership interventions and contextual processes, and to give participants a firmer idea of the potential and limitations of value chain partnerships to achieve developmental targets.

T1  - Food safety and the political economy of food governance: the case of shrimp farming in Nam Dinh Province, Vietnam
AN  - 1433113169
AB  - This contribution is a critique of the public and private governance models in response to the food safety crisis in Vietnam. Using shrimp farming in Nam Dinh province as a case study, the paper argues that public food governance has addressed some of the safety issues in the input sector but remains largely ineffective at the production level due to limited financial and human resources. In turn, private governance has had more successes but its impact is limited to the value-chain while food safety can be influenced by both sectoral and cross-sectoral production practices. In addition, it reinforces the subordination of direct producers by keeping them within industrial production, passing down the cost of safety compliance, and forcing them to assume production risks while reducing their profit margins. More importantly, safety governance under industrial farming is likely to open new opportunities for land expropriation and concentration, affecting the livelihood of small farmers and potentially leading to political unrest. The essay thus asserts that food safety needs to be addressed under the integrated framework of Food Sovereignty, which seeks to obtain food quality, including safety together with agroecological production, farmers' control of productive resources and the enabling of local trading systems.

T1  - A political ecology of socio-economic differentiation: debt, inputs and liberalization reforms in southwestern Burkina Faso
AN  - 1433112958
AB  - This paper builds on work from the agrarian change and political ecology literatures to analyze the process of agrarian change among smallholder cotton farmers in southwestern Burkina Faso. Specifically, we use a rural survey of 72 heads of household in three villages to examine whether and how (1) access to agricultural inputs, (2) debt and (3) liberalization reforms combine to produce rural socio-economic differentiation based on wealth. We find that wealthier farmers use more mineral fertilizer and manure inputs than their poorer counterparts. Wealthier farmers are also better able to remain debt-free as cotton prices drop and input prices rise. Moreover, they are able to take advantage of the neo-liberal restructuring of cotton cooperatives to change polices on debt repayment and input provisioning to their favor. This growing divide has large implications for rural food security, particularly as land becomes scarcer, fallows disappear and the need to intensify production grows. This research addresses two gaps in the agrarian change literature in relating how liberalization reforms and biophysical elements drive rural socio-economic differentiation. This work also shows that merging the concerns of political ecology with the agrarian change literature allows for a deeper examination of rural socio-economic differentiation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Value Chains for Integrating Small Producers into Market: Small-Scale Organic Turmeric Processing Enterprises in Orissa
AN  - 1430424918
AB  - The paper analyzes the value chains of small-scale organic turmeric processing enterprises in Kandhamd district of Orissa state in India. The key sections of the paper provide the background of evolution of these enterprises, their business operations, various chain participants and their functions in the value chain. The value chain analysis reveals strong inter-firm relations in the chain that facilitate the integration of small producers in the market. The paper concludes that an increasing demand for the organic turmeric products from both domestic as well as international markets offers scope for further growth and development of these enterprises.

T1  - The impact of cooperative patronage: the case of National Small Holder Farmers' Association (NASFAM) of Malawi in Kasungu district
AN  - 1418119083; 4455982
AB  - This paper analyses the impact of individual farmers' participation in the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi (NASFAM). Precisely the paper analyses the effect of participation on credit market access, fertilizer use and total incomes of its participants in the Kasungu district of Malawi. NASFAM is a form of producer cooperative with a number of socio-economic functions. Using data on income per capita, fertilizer expenditure and access to credit, this paper tests the hypothesis that participation in NASFAM positively impacted incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition. Employing Propensity Score Matching methodology to estimate Average Treatment Effects (ATT) on programme members, this paper finds evidence that participation in NASFAM had a positive effect on all the endogenous variables. Membership enhances household level incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition and is hence in line with national goals of poverty reduction, the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) principles, the SADC's Regional Indicative Strategy Development Plan (RISDP) and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Based on these findings and the fact that credit and fertilizer access are still problematic in Malawi's rural areas, it appears that there is great need for NASFAM to expand to areas where it currently does not have activities. Such expansion would ensure food security over a wider range of rural households through improved input access.

T1  - Social capital in establishing collective marketing of bananas in central America
AN  - 1418111408; 4456938
AB  - Collective marketing is a proven strategy to improve market access for small-scale producers and reduce poverty through increased income. In this study, four groups of smallholders in Honduras and Nicaragua were studied to explore whether indicators of social capital can be used to predict success in setting up collective marketing. A baseline assessment of the groups' social capital endowments during the pre-marketing phase is compared with their marketing success after two years. Results show that the groups' different initial levels of social capital were not directly linked with market success. All groups built up relevant social capital during the establishment phase with external support, although some members left the groups. For determining how to provide support to emerging group marketing, the commonly used measures for social capital to predict success are therefore not sufficient. Additional indicators are needed - such as access to assets and start-up skills of members - for assessing the capacity of groups for continuous construction of social capital in a dynamic process.

T1  - Ukraine horticulture development project: the use of incentives to motivate collective action
AN  - 1418110992; 4456936
AB  - The negative experience of large-scale collective farms during the Soviet period, whose primary function was to benefit the state as opposed to the individual small farmer, remains in the psyche of farmers throughout Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), serving as a disincentive to collaborate. This perspective clashes with a rapidly changing global marketplace, which demands large volumes of high-quality products to meet the needs of consumers. Using the Mennonite Economic Development Associates' (MEDA) Ukraine Horticulture Development Project (UHDP) as a case study, this article demonstrates that, introduced using a culturally sensitive approach and with the right market-based incentives, informal and formal methods of collective action can result in important benefits for small farmers in terms of increased incomes, stronger market position, and strengthened community alliances.

T1  - Perceptions and outlook on intercropping coffee with banana as an opportunity for smallholder coffee farmers in Uganda
AN  - 1468417203
AB  - Coffee and banana are important cash and food crops in Uganda and the surrounding East African highland region. Production is dominated by smallholders that have limited arable land and often coffee and banana are intercropped. No significant research and development efforts have been undertaken over the last few decades on this coffee/banana intercropping system. Because recent studies suggest that this system could be a practice with high benefits to the fanners, we decided to study the perceptions of stakeholders along the coffee value chain starting with fanners. Perception analysis based on open-ended interviews following interview guides revealed that a major limitation for the sustainability of this system was poor soil fertility conditions. Perceptions on the benefits of intercropping differed little among coffee actors; that is, banana intercropping provides additional food and income from smallholders' limited land and helps fanners reduce risks related to drought, pest/disease attacks and coffee price volatility. However, fanners' desire to minimize risks does not match the objective of stakeholders higher up the coffee value chain to maximize coffee production. Furthennore, research by public institutes, both national and international, is primarily organized for single crops and not systems. We conclude that the institutional setting of the coffee sector hampers the promotion of intercropping, despite the benefits for the farmer. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Private food standards, trade and institutions in Vietnam
AN  - 1437339886
AB  - International horticulture markets are increasingly governed by transnational private regulations that create a new set of challenges not only for the market but also for local governance and policy regimes. Accordingly, resources from a range of international governance institutions and donors promoting development through neoliberal market rules have been directed towards ensuring that market entry barriers are not prohibitive. This paper presents the results of a recent study undertaken in Vietnam that assessed outcomes within a single value chain governed by GLOBALG.A.P, where technical and financial assistance were provided to smallholders. The constructivist approach highlights that, in addition to typical market entry barriers, additional obstacles existed that prevented smallholders from market participation. These were socially, culturally and historically situated and rooted in informal institutions. Failing to incorporate these into assistance planning may lead to the unequal distribution of development benefits associated with these changing market governance arrangements.

T1  - The cluster panacea?: Questioning the role of cooperative shrimp aquaculture in Vietnam
AN  - 1317117334
AB  - This paper analyses the role of 'clustering' as a form of cooperative production to improve the environmental performance of shrimp farmers and facilitating them to upgrade their position in the global value chain. Comparing intensive and extensive shrimp farmer clusters in Ca Mau province, Vietnam, we explore how this form of cooperative production can enable small-holders to upgrade both functional and relational dimensions of production to meet new requirements for participation in the global shrimp value chain. The results show that by facilitating horizontal coordination between producers clusters can improve the management capacity of both intensive and extensive producers for meeting international production standards. However, the success of clusters also depends on the type and strength of vertical coordination with other actors along the value chain for both the provision of inputs and marketing of outputs. The paper concludes that for improved extensive shrimp farmer clusters to take further advantage of production-oriented quality standards the Vietnamese government needs to play a greater role in the development of production infrastructure and create a legal framework for private sector-led cluster formation.

T1  - Reactions to the Market: Small Farmers in the Economic Reshaping of Nicaragua, Cuba, Russia, and China
AN  - 1365748841
AB  - Neoliberalism's impacts on post-1990 Nicaraguan farmers parallel those that affected small agriculturalists in many other developing countries in the same period: the weakening of public-sector supports such as credit, technical assistance, and price supports; a new emphasis on exports; comparative advantage and tariffreductions that undermined those producing for domestic markets; and an agrarian counterreform that privatized many cooperatives and state farms.  Serious students of Marxism and of what used to be called "actually existing socialism" might wonder, however, about why other, more relevant debates go unexamined in this book, for example, Bukharin's defense of the pro-peasant New Economic Policy in the face of the Stalinist push toward collectivization and central planning, or Marx's intriguing correspondence with populist Vera Zasulich, in which he concurred with her thesis that the Czarist-era peasant commune might be able to serve as a direct springboard to socialism, permitting Russia to bypass capitalism altogether.

T1  - Core and common members in the genesis of farmer cooperatives in China
AN  - 1335017114; 4430318
AB  - This paper addresses the genesis of farmer cooperatives in China in terms of the actors. Empirical results from a multiple case study indicate that the genesis of cooperatives in China is due to entrepreneurial farmers and the government, rather than a bottom-up, collective action process of many small farmers.

T1  - Good for whom? Supermarkets and small farmers in South Africa - a critical review of current approaches to increasing access to modern markets
AN  - 1324956025; 4426197
AB  - Small-scale agriculture is one of the few tools available to support improved rural livelihoods on a significant scale in South Africa. Access to output markets is a key factor in generating higher incomes. The rise of modern markets (supermarkets in particular) is generally viewed as positive for the rural poor, although most commentators accede that there are challenges to be overcome in obtaining access to such markets. These challenges are generally perceived as supply-side issues: That is, the 'fault' for market exclusion lies largely with small producers - their production methods, their business organisation and their location - rather than with these markets themselves. This study asserts that much of the research that has been undertaken in this area is in fact incomplete, because it has excluded two key issues: The likely impact of the dominant supermarket business model on small farmers; and the actual position of small farmers in those countries with high levels of supermarket concentration. A closer examination of the supermarket model suggests it is inherently hostile towards smaller producers. The South African food retail market structure resembles that of industrialised countries rather than developing countries. Therefore, we should expect that the position of South African small farmers vis-à-vis supermarkets is similar to that of small farmers in industrialised countries, who are increasingly excluded from these value chains.

T1  - Asset building in response to value chain development: lessons from taro producers in Nicaragua
AN  - 1468444627
AB  - Value chain development (VCD) dominates discussions on how to address poverty through engagement with the private sector. In the rural sector, interventions often focus on building mutually beneficial linkages for production, and marketing of agricultural and forest products. However, the poverty impacts of VCD remain an open question. This research examines the impacts of interventions in Nicaragua for the development of a taro value chain involving smallholders, a cooperative and exporters. Poverty impacts are assessed at the household level based on changes in the endowments of five livelihood assets. Data collection concerned changes in asset endowments for 127 households from 2007 to 2009. The results suggest that the poverty impacts of VCD varied considerably based on production technologies, but that, in general were limited due to households' low levels of pre-existing asset endowments, the limited nature of the VCD interventions and a less-than-enabling market and institutional context. Greater attention to the heterogeneous needs of the rural poor is necessary. Policy makers must also assume some responsibility for the external environment affecting private sector and NGO interventions to address poverty reduction goals through VCD. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assessing the adaptation strategies of farmers facing multiple stressors: lessons from the coffee and global changes project in Mesoamerica
AN  - 1285626747; 4402353
AB  - This paper analyzes the challenges and opportunities entailed in the design, implementation and dissemination of an interdisciplinary project that evolved into a knowledge co-production effort. The project explored the livelihood strategies of coffee growers in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica facing multiple stressors of economic (market shocks and price volatility) and physical nature (climate variability and pest incidence). Our objective was to determine the factors that influence farmers' decisions and the implications of those decisions for the people and the landscapes of the region. To achieve this objective, we intended to engage farm communities and sector representatives in the research process, and to a large extent this intent was realized. Nevertheless, the project illustrates the difficulties in achieving knowledge ''co-production'' with stakeholders whose day-to-day existence focuses on issues largely outside the domain of the research program. We adopted decision-analysis tools to integrate our knowledge and hypotheses to find a common language and structure for our research design. In relation to regional and national policy makers and sector experts, we aimed to communicate the decision-environment of the smallholder producer to enhance awareness of the institutional opportunities and constraints in the adaptation process. For the farmers themselves, we aimed to serve as conduits and mirrors of their own knowledge, rather than serving as external authorities on issues that appeared to be of little interest to them. Through the course of the project, we experimented with diverse modes of stakeholder interaction and, through collaboration with local experts in communication strategies, identified a set of tools for successful dissemination of results. The credibility and direct ties of the participating research organizations and collaborating institutes with the local communities were often an asset, sometimes a complication, but always a critical factor in the process of stakeholder interaction. The messages constructed from the collective knowledge of local farmers in distinct regions in four countries with different social and institutional histories represent crucial information for policy makers who are looking to support the adaptation processes of rural people facing changes of a global nature. However, communicating these messages in a usable and useful way to decision makers at various levels proved to be challenging. All rights reserved, Elsevier

T1  - ESTRATEGIAS SOCIALES Y ECOLÓGICAS DE RESILIENCIA AL CAMBIO CLIMÁTICO IMPLEMENTADAS POR LOS AGRICULTORES DEL MUNICIPIO DE MARINILLA (COLOMBIA)/Socioecological strategies to enhance resiliency implemented by small farmers of Marinilla county (Colombia)
AN  - 1660153039
AB  - The main goal of this research conducted in the Municipio de Marinilla, Colombia, was to document the farmers perceptions on climate change and the strategies they use to adapt their production systems to the causes and effects of climatic variability. The used methodology combined quantitative (field data gathering) and qualitative (interviews) techniques. Farmers mention deforestation, use of pesticides and burning as factoes that affect climate change and that are related to the increase in rainfall, changes in the seasonality of dry and wet seasons, soil erosion and mud slides. Farmers have developed and implemented a number of adaptation practices such as living barriers, construction and maintenanace of terraces, increasing soil organic matter, crop and animal diversification, wáter harvesting and seed saving along with some appropiate technologies such as wood stoves, solar dryers and biogas. Many of these techniques have improved the environmental integrity of the farms, the recobvery and valorization of local knowledge, collective innovation, and adoption of new practices, thus strengthening the autnoly of farmers and their organizations.

T1  - Bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis prevalence in cattle from selected milk cooperatives in Arsi zone, Oromia region, Ethiopia
AN  - 1426418125; 23941112
AB  - Doc number: 163

              
Abstract

              
Background: Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) and bovine brucellosis are two important milk-borne zoonoses that have been shown to be prevalent to various degrees in Ethiopian cattle.

              
The study was carried out in four Woredas (districts) around Asella town, Arsi Zone between October 2011 and March 2012 and included 318 small-holders in 13 dairy cooperatives that marketed the delivered milk. The aims of the study were i) to assess the prevalence of the two diseases in cattle in a cross-sectional study, ii) to assess potential risk factors of BTB and brucellosis to humans as well as the knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) among these farmers towards these diseases.

              
Results: BTB testing using the comparative intradermal skin test (CIDT) was done on 584 milking cows, out of which 417 were serologically tested for brucellosis using the Rose Bengal Plate Test and reactors confirmed with an indirect ELISA test (PrioCHECK®). The individual animal prevalence was 0.3% (95% CI 0.1% to 1.3%) for BTB, 1.7% (95% CI 0.8% to 3.5%) for brucellosis and 8.9% (95% CI 6.8% to 11.5%) for MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex). Of the 13 milk cooperatives, two had at least one positive BTB reactor and five had animals positive for brucellosis.

              
Cross-breeds accounted for 100% and 71.4% of the BTB and brucellosis reactors respectively. For both diseases, there were prevalence variations depending on Woreda. No animal was concomitant reactor for BTB and brucellosis.

              
Raw milk was consumed by 55.4% of the respondents. 79.2% of the respondents reported touching the afterbirth with bare hands. The latter was fed to dogs in 83% of the households. One cow among the herds of the 130 interviewees had aborted in the last 12 months. Among the interviewees, 77% stated knowing tuberculosis in general but 42 out of the 130 respondents (32.3%) did not know that BTB was transmitted by livestock. Less than half (47.7%) of the respondents knew about brucellosis.

              
Conclusions: Low prevalence of both diseases reflected the potential for the area to compete with the growing milk demand. The authors discussed the possible control strategies for the area.

T1  - Entry of Chinese Small Farmers into Big Markets: From Enterprise-Led Structures to Farmer Cooperatives
AN  - 1373466235; 2011-433966
AB  - Over the past thirty years, reforms in China have pushed forward the integral development of the economy and opened up agriculture to modernization. Small farmers who obtained independent production and operating rights during the reform period must now confront the pressure of market competition. The "Investor-Owned Firm (IOF) + farmers" mode or leading-enterprises-led mode has pioneered agricultural industrialization in China. However, it has some limitations in terms of contract instability and its inability to ensure farmers' rights and interests. At the same time, cooperative organizations of small farmers have been legally accepted and supported by the government and are developing rapidly. In this article, we analyze the alternative modes of agricultural industrialization, especially the effectiveness and limitations of farmer cooperatives. We find that farmer cooperatives are going to play a more and more important role in the foreseeable future, while the leading-enterprises-led mode will also persist as a key contract form in agricultural industrialization.

T1  - Can a public GAP approach ensure safety and fairness? A comparative study of Q-GAP in Thailand
AN  - 1373428898; 201329797
AB  - Since the early 2000s, the governments in ASEAN (the Association of South East Asian Nations) countries have developed 'good agricultural practices' (GAP) as public approaches to field-level quality assurance. Besides the primary goals of consumer food safety and quality assurance, these public GAP programs aim to support small-scale farmer inclusion in mainstream markets. This goal represents the antithesis of the prevailing trend that private GAP approaches have tightened integration with resourceful, large-scale producers in global value chains. This paper examines the compatibility of the goals of safety assurance and social justice in a public GAP approach through comparative analysis of Thailand's Q-GAP between two local contexts of fruit production and marketing. The research findings suggest that while the public GAP scheme could draw the participation of a broad cohort of local small-scale producers and serve to certify their production, its impact on changing producers' on-field practices and catalyzing their access to the global market through food safety assurance is limited. The binding factors include the lack of producers' understanding of the principles of the programme, limited additional economic merits for them, and the influence of extra-local market forces that stress economies of size and food quality rather than food safety.

T1  - Bloom or bust? A global value chain approach to smallholder flower production in Kenya
AN  - 1355564861
AB  - Purpose - Integrating smallholders into high-value global markets represents a unique opportunity to effect large-scale poverty reduction in the countryside. The purpose of the paper is to add empirical evidence to the discussion of how to best incorporate smallholders into the formal economy sustainably and responsibly. Design/methodology/approach - The paper first builds a theoretical framework around global value chain theory and literature on smallholder inclusion and Kenya's growing horticultural sector. It then moves to explore a Kenyan smallholder-based business model that incorporates 4,000 flower producers through an efficient and transparent intermediary. The analysis focuses on the importance of governance, upgrading and strong intermediaries for including smallholders in horticultural value chains. Findings - In conclusion, this paper finds that although smallholder inclusion is both favorable and feasible based on theory, literature and case study analysis, it remains limited. It proposes embracing innovative smallholder-based business models as a viable path out of poverty in countries with low labor costs, suitable climatic conditions and basic infrastructural capacities. Research limitations/implications - Limitations include a reliance on largely qualitative research methods due to gaps in available data. Practical implications - Policy implications include the necessity of promoting agricultural development through investments in extension services, the creation of research and development centers and improvements in the rule of law. Originality/value - This paper is unique in its focus on business models and global value chains as mechanisms through which to include smallholders into the global economy.

T1  - Analysing Relationship Dynamics in Cashew Supply Chains
AN  - 1490542041
AB  - Long term relationship is very crucial for efficiency and sustainability of supply chains. However, early research in agricultural marketing focused mainly on the economics of channels and ignored the structure of social relationship within the chain members. This research study aims at studying the relationship dynamics in supply chain of cashew nut in Garo hills of Meghalaya (India) from small holder's perspective. This study was based on response of small holder cashew growers towards their most important partner (in terms of maximum quantity of transactions) in the study area which happens to be pre-harvest contractors. On the basis of responses from 193 small holder cashew nut growers, about 23 pre harvest contractors dealing in cashew nut marketing in Garo hills of Meghalaya (India), the study finds that good and socially acceptable relationships dynamics among the chain members play an important role in their satisfaction from the chain. Positive variables (socially acceptable) affect the satisfaction of small holders in a positive way and negative variables (socially non acceptable) affects the satisfaction of small holders in a negative way. The opportunistic behaviour and lack of trust leads to dissatisfaction and poor relationship dynamics. The study emphasizes that middlemen of these chains should realize the above dynamics and for long term sustainability of these supply chains ( and mutual benefit of members) should play the role of channel manager.

T1  - Interest rates, output pricing, loan repayments in agricultural inter (de-) linkages: a comparative study
AN  - 1419690962; 4470235
AB  - This paper explore to assess the consequences/effects of various credit related interlinkages through examining the variation of interest rates, output pricing and loan repayment condition in different crop regions in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The data collected from eight villages covers four crops during the crop year 2004-05 and the analysis discusses the nature of interlinkages and the individual behavior. The evidences shows that wide variations on interest rates output pricing and loan repayment across the crops and farm groups between the linked and non-linked contracts in both the States. The weaker parties (Marginal and small farmers) are highly exploited by the stronger parties (landlords, money lenders and commission agents) extracting in the name of default risk charged higher interest and providing lower prices and proved that the Marxist approach that the interlinkage is a survival strategy for weaker parties and it is compulsive involvement in market transaction to meet their subsistence needs rather than efficiency or social welfare of the parties.

T1  - The Political Economy of Contract Farming in China's Agrarian Transition
AN  - 1266174749; 2011-339676
AB  - How does rural China's political economy determine the motivations and constraints that drive small farmers and agribusiness companies into contract farming and shape its practice and impact? This paper identifies three distinctive features of contract farming in China -- varied impact on rural inequality, unstable contractual relations and lack of competitiveness with other alternatives -- and proposes tentative explanations linked to three features in rural China's political economy: strong collective institutions, active state support for agriculture and strong domestic markets. The recent turn in China's agrarian transition towards vertical integration of agriculture with industries is, however, undermining these conditions and may move China towards more convergence with other countries. Studying contract farming in China's unique political economy context shows not only how variations in the political economy can alter its practice and impact, but also how it needs to be evaluated in comparison with competing alternatives.

T1  - The Political Economy of Contract Farming in China's Agrarian Transition
AN  - 1221410694; 201234778
AB  - How does rural China's political economy determine the motivations and constraints that drive small farmers and agribusiness companies into contract farming and shape its practice and impact? This paper identifies three distinctive features of contract farming in China -- varied impact on rural inequality, unstable contractual relations and lack of competitiveness with other alternatives -- and proposes tentative explanations linked to three features in rural China's political economy: strong collective institutions, active state support for agriculture and strong domestic markets. The recent turn in China's agrarian transition towards vertical integration of agriculture with industries is, however, undermining these conditions and may move China towards more convergence with other countries. Studying contract farming in China's unique political economy context shows not only how variations in the political economy can alter its practice and impact, but also how it needs to be evaluated in comparison with competing alternatives.

T1  - Strategies for Increasing Food Production and Food Security in Nigeria
AN  - 1178939590
AB  - Reduction in food production, food insecurity, and youth unemployment have characterized the present day status of the Nigerian economy. These problems have been associated with an increase in population without a corresponding increase in agricultural productivity and favorable policies. This article discusses methods to promote increased food production, poverty alleviation, and food security in Nigeria. It highlights the importance of agriculture to food security and the need to empower smallholder farmers, especially women and youth. The need for holistic agricultural research, encompassing various stakeholders in the government and non-governmental sectors of the agricultural value chain, is also emphasized.

T1  - Sharecropping in Non-traditional Agro-export Production: The Abougnon Contract for Pineapple Cultivation in Cote d'Ivoire
AN  - 1030162221
AB  - This article highlights the role of sharecropping in small-scale, non-traditional export production, through the case of pineapple production in Côte d'Ivoire. The study reveals the diversity of contractual configurations with respect to the same crop, under the same local term of abougnon. Beyond a description of contractual practices, the article explores the rationale for share contracts in a context of imperfect tenancy, labour and credit markets. The analysis of actors' rationales in entering abougnon contracts points out the role of financing constraints and disequilibrium in the tenancy market. It highlights the secondary role played by transaction costs induced by moral hazard, incentives or - up to the crisis that struck down the sector - production and market risks. This in-depth, localised longitudinal case study relies on first-hand data collected through intensive fieldwork conducted in the village of Djimini-Koffikro in 1983-1984 and 2002-2003, updated in 2010.              Cet article met en exergue le rôle du métayage dans la production d'exportation non traditionnelle à petite échelle, en s'appuyant sur le cas de la production d'ananas en Côte d'Ivoire. L'étude révèle la diversité des configurations contractuelles pour une même culture et sous un même terme local (abougnon). Au delà d'une description des pratiques contractuelles, cet article examine la logique sous-tendant les contrats de métayage dans un contexte où les marchés de location de terre, du travail et du crédit sont imparfaits. L'analyse des raisons pour lesquelles les acteurs passent des contrats d'abougnon met en évidence le rôle des contraintes de financement et du déséquilibre du marché locatif. Elle souligne le rôle secondaire des coûts de transactions induits par l'aléa moral, des incitations ou - jusqu'à la crise qui s'est abattue sur ce secteur - des risques de production et de marché. Cette étude de cas longitudinale, approfondie et localisée, s'appuie sur des données de première main recueillies grâce à un travail intensif de terrain effectué dans le village de Djimini-Koffikro en 1983-1984 et 2002-2003, puis actualisées en 2010.

T1  - Supermarket revolution in Asia and emerging development strategies to include small farmers
AN  - 1030718828
AB  - A "supermarket revolution" has occurred in developing countries in the past 2 decades. We focus on three specific issues that reflect the impact of this revolution, particularly in Asia: continuity in transformation, innovation in transformation, and unique development strategies. First, the record shows that the rapid growth observed in the early 2000s in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand has continued, and the "newcomers" -- India and Vietnam -- have grown even faster. Although foreign direct investment has been important, the roles of domestic conglomerates and even state investment have been significant and unique. Second, Asia's supermarket revolution has exhibited unique pathways of retail diffusion and procurement system change. There has been "precocious" penetration of rural towns by rural supermarkets and rural business hubs, emergence of penetration of fresh produce retail that took much longer to initiate in other regions, and emergence of Asian retail developing-country multinational chains. In procurement, a symbiosis between modern retail and the emerging and consolidating modern food processing and logistics sectors has arisen. Third, several approaches are being tried to link small farmers to supermarkets. Some are unique to Asia, for example assembling into a "hub" or "platform" or "park" the various companies and services that link farmers to modern markets. Other approaches relatively new to Asia are found elsewhere, especially in Latin America, including "bringing modern markets to farmers" by establishing collection centers and multipronged collection cum service provision arrangements, and forming market cooperatives and farmer companies to help small farmers access supermarkets.

T1  - The impact of coffee certification on small-scale producers' livelihoods: a case study from the Jimma Zone, Ethiopia
AN  - 1516422350
AB  - What is the impact of product certification on small-scale farmers' livelihoods? To what extent does the participation of Ethiopian small-scale coffee farmers in certified local cooperative structures improve their socioeconomic situation? To answer these questions, this article employs household data of 249 coffee farmers from six different cooperatives collected in the Jimma zone of Southwestern Ethiopia in 2009. Findings show that the certification of coffee cooperatives has in total a low impact on small-scale coffee producers' livelihoods mainly due to (1) low productivity, (2) insignificant price premium, and (3) poor access to credit and information from the cooperative. Differences in production and organizational capacities between the local cooperatives are mirrored in the extent of the certification benefits for the smallholders. "Good" cooperatives have reaped the benefits of certification, whereas "bad" ones did not fare well. In this regard the "cooperative effect" overlies the "certification effect."

T1  - 'Because of poverty, we had to come together': collective action for improved food security in rural Kenya and Uganda
AN  - 1459494464
AB  - Agricultural productivity in East African smallholder systems is notoriously low and food production faces multiple challenges, including soil degradation, decreasing land availability, poor market integration, disease burdens and climate change impacts. However, recent evidence from an in-depth study from two sites in Kenya and Uganda shows signs of new social dynamics as a response to these multiple stressors. This paper focuses on the emergence of local social institutions for collective action, in which particularly women farmers organize themselves. Although previous research on collective action has largely focused on common-pool resource management, we argue that collective action is one potential pathway to livelihood and sustainability improvements also in a setting of private land ownership. Trust building, awareness raising and actions to improve livelihood security through risk sharing and pooling of labour and other limited assets have given people more time and resources available for diversification, preventative activities, experimentation and resource conservation. It thereby strengthens farmers' capacity to cope with and adapt to change, as well as contributes to the agency at the local level. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The next Great Trek? South African commercial farmers move north
AN  - 1283639575; 201305009
AB  - This paper analyses the shifting role of South African farmers, agribusiness and capital elsewhere in the Southern African region and the rest of the continent. It explores recent trends in this expansion, and investigates the interests and agendas shaping such deals, and the ideologies and discourses of legitimation employed in favour of them. While for the past two decades small numbers of South African farmers have moved to Mozambique, Zambia and several other countries, this trend seems to be undergoing both a quantitative and a qualitative shift. Whereas in the past their migration was largely individual or in small groups, now it is being more centrally organised and coordinated, is more frequently taking the form of large concessions for newly formed consortia and agribusinesses, and is increasingly reliant on external financing through transnational partnerships. By early 2010, the commercial farmers' association Agri South Africa (AgriSA) was engaged in negotiations for land acquisitions with the governments of 22 African countries. This essay is the product of a scoping study to document and analyse major land acquisitions by South African farmers and agribusinesses, and the processes through which these have occurred and are occurring. It considers the changing character, scale and location of South African investments elsewhere in the region and the continent, and focuses specifically on the AgriSA-Congo deal (the largest deal concluded thus far), and acquisitions by the two South African sugar giants, Illovo and Tongaat-Hulett, for outgrower and estate expansion elsewhere in the region. The study addresses the degree to which South Africa is no longer merely exporting its farmers, but also its value chains, to the rest of the continent -- and what this means for trajectories of agrarian change. It questions how we might understand the growing trend of 'intra-regional land grabbing' and, in the cases discussed, suggests that South African-based companies are acting as arteries of global capital.

T1  - As You Sow, So Shall You Reap: The Welfare Impacts of Contract Farming
AN  - 1023026668; 201225212
AB  - Contract farming is widely perceived as a means of increasing welfare in developing countries. Because of smallholder self-selection in contract farming, however, it is not clear whether contract farming actually increases grower welfare. In an effort to improve upon existing estimates of the welfare impacts of contract farming, this paper uses the results of a contingent-valuation experiment to control for unobserved heterogeneity among smallholders. Using data across several regions, firms, and crops in Madagascar, results indicate that a 1-percent increase in the likelihood of participating in contract farming is associated with a 0.5-percent increase in household income, among other positive impacts.

T1  - The work practices and ergonomic problems experienced by garment workers in Ghana
AN  - 1022335949
AB  - Although the role of ergonomics in everyday occupations has generated increased attention in the last few years, poor working environments present a serious threat to the livelihood and career of small-scale garment producers. This paper is one of the first to study dressmakers and tailors and their work environments in Ghana. The apparel industry holds a dominant share (40% out of a total of 24133 establishments) in the country's manufacturing industry. However, to date, very little consideration has been given to the nature of this working environment. For example: do dressmakers and tailors perform their work under stressful conditions and do they attribute injuries to the tasks they perform in the workplace? Involving a sample of 100 individual garment producers as participants, a semi-structured interview schedule was used to elicit information on dressmakers' and tailors' knowledge of workplace stressors. Their work environment was observed and assessed for stressors. A physical discomfort survey was employed to identify the injuries they attributed to the performance of tasks in their workplace. Findings revealed that stressors included noise, poor ventilation, unsuitable seat heights, widths and depths, and awkward postures. Encountered discomforts affected the performance of sewing tasks and resulted in occasional and frequent pains in the lower back, neck, upper back and shoulders. These working conditions are detrimental to the development of this sector and the study concludes that there is an important educational role for trade organizations to assist manufacturers to improve working conditions for their workers.

T1  - Making Room for Smallholder Cooperatives in Tanzanian Tea Production: Can Fairtrade Do That?: JBE
AN  - 1021033473
AB  - The objective of this article is to examine the different ways that smallholders are brought into Fairtrade certification schemes in the Tanzanian tea industry. We examine the different ownership relations of processing factories and the perceived benefits of these different arrangements. We use descriptive qualitative analysis based on qualitative interviews and focus groups conducted between 2008 and 2010 to identify the significance between factory ownership organization and Fairtrade certification. We find that there is a movement toward innovation in the organizational strategies, which includes new ownership arrangements of processing factories and outgrower contracts that have been associated with certified Fairtrade production. We also suggest that organizational innovation is significant for obtaining scheme success yet perceived benefits of and increased information about Fairtrade production is independent from ownership shares in processing.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Linking Smallholders to Markets: Determinants and Impacts of Farmer Collective Action in Kenya
AN  - 1728654453; 2011-280370
AB  - This article investigates determinants and impacts of cooperative organization, using the example of smallholder banana farmers in Kenya. Farmer groups are inclusive of the poor, although wealthier households are more likely to join. Employing propensity score matching, we find positive income effects for active group members. Yet price advantages of collective marketing are small, and high-value market potentials have not yet been tapped. Beyond prices, farmer groups function as important catalysts for innovation adoption through promoting efficient information flows. We discuss the conditions under which collective action is useful, and through what mechanisms the potential benefits emerge. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Enhancing innovation in livestock value chains through networks: lessons from fodder innovation case studies in developing countries
AN  - 1024215336; 4312376
AB  - Fodder scarcity is a perennial problem for many smallholder farmers in developing countries. This paper discusses how fodder technologies and knowledge have been introduced and integrated in diverse livestock production systems in Ethiopia, Syria and Vietnam. A synthesis of lessons learnt shows that fodder innovation is triggered and diffused by actors interacting and learning in networks, and on farms. Fodder innovation, being only one element of livestock value chains, is sustainably enhanced when linked to other innovations and market-oriented activities that optimize productivity gains. Yet innovating smallholder farmers face systemic constraints to access markets, and need to organize in groups to exploit opportunities. The paper concludes that rather than treating innovation systems and value chain approaches to agricultural development as separate tools, the integration of their complementary features enhances smallholders' innovation and market success.

T1  - Linking Smallholders to Markets: Determinants and Impacts of Farmer Collective Action in Kenya
AN  - 1023026462; 201225219
AB  - This article investigates determinants and impacts of cooperative organization, using the example of smallholder banana farmers in Kenya. Farmer groups are inclusive of the poor, although wealthier households are more likely to join. Employing propensity score matching, we find positive income effects for active group members. Yet price advantages of collective marketing are small, and high-value market potentials have not yet been tapped. Beyond prices, farmer groups function as important catalysts for innovation adoption through promoting efficient information flows. We discuss the conditions under which collective action is useful, and through what mechanisms the potential benefits emerge. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - The next Great Trek? South African commercial farmers move north
AN  - 1017853271
AB  - This paper analyses the shifting role of South African farmers, agribusiness and capital elsewhere in the Southern African region and the rest of the continent. It explores recent trends in this expansion, and investigates the interests and agendas shaping such deals, and the ideologies and discourses of legitimation employed in favour of them. While for the past two decades small numbers of South African farmers have moved to Mozambique, Zambia and several other countries, this trend seems to be undergoing both a quantitative and a qualitative shift. Whereas in the past their migration was largely individual or in small groups, now it is being more centrally organised and coordinated, is more frequently taking the form of large concessions for newly formed consortia and agribusinesses, and is increasingly reliant on external financing through transnational partnerships. By early 2010, the commercial farmers' association Agri South Africa (AgriSA) was engaged in negotiations for land acquisitions with the governments of 22 African countries. This essay is the product of a scoping study to document and analyse major land acquisitions by South African farmers and agribusinesses, and the processes through which these have occurred and are occurring. It considers the changing character, scale and location of South African investments elsewhere in the region and the continent, and focuses specifically on the AgriSA-Congo deal (the largest deal concluded thus far), and acquisitions by the two South African sugar giants, Illovo and Tongaat-Hulett, for outgrower and estate expansion elsewhere in the region. The study addresses the degree to which South Africa is no longer merely exporting its farmers, but also its value chains, to the rest of the continent -- and what this means for trajectories of agrarian change. It questions how we might understand the growing trend of 'intra-regional land grabbing' and, in the cases discussed, suggests that South African-based companies are acting as arteries of global capital.

T1  - Agricultural Extension, Collective Action and Innovation Systems: Lessons on Network Brokering from Peru and Mexico
AN  - 1151766234
AB  - Purpose: New approaches to extension service delivery are needed that stimulate increased agricultural production, contribute to collective action and which also foster the emergence of agricultural innovation systems. Research in Peru and Mexico explores some of these new approaches.

              
 Design/methodology/approach: In both countries, a qualitative value chain mapping methodology was used to explore the challenges of providing extension provision to resource-poor farmers in ways that stimulate collective action and agricultural innovation systems.

              
 Findings: In Peru, collective action and the development of an agriculture innovation system required the network broker activities of initially a non-governmental organization (NGO) and then increasingly trusted local farmers known as Kamayoq. In Mexico, collective action took place in the context of a linear transfer-of-technology approach focused on access to improved maize seed and there was no evidence of the emergence of innovation networks.

              
 Practical implications: Different extension modalities can foster collective action but this in itself is not enough to encourage innovation. Extension needs to focus on combining collective action with networking amongst sets of heterogeneous value chain actors.

              
 Originality/value: The Peruvian and Mexican case studies demonstrate that the debate about the modalities of pluralistic and diversified extension systems has obscured the reality that the development community still has some way to go to achieve comprehensively the paradigm shift from a linear transfer-of-technology approach to one that supports the emergence of agricultural innovation systems.

T1  - Coffee as a livelihood support for small farmers:
AN  - 1033283925; 4321109
AB  - Coffee production as an income-generating project has been promoted by the Nepalese government with the collaboration of international development agencies. Those areas of Nepal with suitable climate and geography have the potential to grow high-quality Arabica coffee for the international market. This research examines the possibilities of organic coffee production as a livelihood support for small-scale farmers in Hamsapur village in Nepal. Using value chain analysis, coffee producers and collectors were interviewed, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants. Findings showed that local farmers have great interest in coffee production; however, the income generation promises have not been realized because of insufficient quality, a lack of transparency in the local coffee market, and organizational issues. Analysis showed there is a need for alternative business relationships with producers along the coffee value chain that result in greater benefit to farmers.

T1  - Small farmers and big retail: trade-offs of supplying supermarkets in Nicaragua
AN  - 918746313; 4264495
AB  - In Nicaragua and elsewhere in Central America, small-scale farmers are weighing the risks of entering into contracts with supermarket chains. We use unique data from cooperatives supplying supermarkets to study the effect of supply agreements on producers' mean output prices and price stability. We find that prices paid by the domestic retail chain approximate the traditional market in mean and variance while mean prices paid by Walmart are significantly lower than the traditional market. However, the Walmart contract is found to systematically reduce price volatility. We find some evidence, however, that farmers may be paying too much for this contractual insurance against price variation. All rights reserved, Elsevier

T1  - Transaction costs, institutional arrangements and inequality outcomes: potato marketing by small producers in rural Peru
AN  - 918746277; 4264494
AB  - We explore the distributional effects of lowering transaction costs to allow access to improved market opportunities for small farmers in the Peruvian Highlands. We find that when new marketing opportunities arise, those that have more land, are better educated and are well organized are able to deal with the complexities that the new contractual arrangements entail. Although this on average implies an increase in net income for small farmers, it also affects the distribution of earnings, generating a more polarized small farmer economy. To counteract this effect and reduce inequality in the opportunities of less endowed small farmers, complementary policies need to be put in place. All rights reserved, Elsevier

T1  - Small Farmers and Big Retail: Trade-offs of Supplying Supermarkets in Nicaragua
AN  - 906391454
AB  - In Nicaragua and elsewhere in Central America, small-scale farmers are weighing the risks of entering into contracts with supermarket chains. We use unique data from cooperatives supplying supermarkets to study the effect of supply agreements on producers' mean output prices and price stability. We find that prices paid by the domestic retail chain approximate the traditional market in mean and variance while mean prices paid by Walmart are significantly lower than the traditional market. However, the Walmart contract is found to systematically reduce price volatility. We find some evidence, however, that farmers may be paying too much for this contractual insurance against price variation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The mixing of methods: A three-step process for improving rigour in impact evaluations
AN  - 927684109; 2012-02307-002
AB  - This article describes a systematic process that is helpful in improving impact evaluation assignments, within restricted budgets and timelines. It involves three steps: a rethink of the key questions of the evaluation to develop more relevant, specific questions; a way of designing a mix of research methods to generate evidence that supports more valid conclusions; and a step that aims to make evaluation outputs more useful. The approach is illustrated through two examples: one on measuring income impacts in an irrigated horticulture programme in Nepal, Zambia and Ethiopia; and another on the assessment of changes in organizational capacities for collective marketing by smallholders in Bolivia. The article demonstrates that this simple, straightforward and structured three-step process helped to reduce the tendency to one-method designs. Enhanced critical reflection within the team allowed for greater sensitivity to validity threats and the creativity to find ways to handle them.

T1  - The ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint: Implementation and Effectiveness Assessment for Philippine Agriculture
AN  - 1550131337
AB  - The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint outlines the plan of countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to unify into a single market and production base. A priority focus for integration is the enhancement of trade among ASEAN member- countries and long-term competitiveness of food and agriculture products produced within ASEAN. Based on key-person interviews, this study identifies the specific gaps in the implementation of the blueprint in the case of Philippine agriculture and makes appropriate recommendations. The widest gaps in AEC Blueprint implementation appear to be in areas of cooperation related to private sector linkages, agricultural cooperatives, research and development (R&D), and technology transfer. For the private sector, a key factor accounting for the gap is preference for own networking and business arrangements. Development of producer cooperatives is at a nascent phase in the country. Considerable progress has been made in Good Agriculture Practices (GAP), Good Aquaculture Practices (GAqP), Good Animal Husbandry Practices (GAHP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP), and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP); in general, harmonization is most advanced where foreign markets have imposed stringent standards, i.e., the case of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP). The following measures are recommended: First, reexamine objectives and targets for cooperation with the private sector, agriculture cooperatives, R&D, and technology transfer. Trade standard harmonization is relatively easily justified; however, the collective rationale for cooperation in the other areas needs to be better articulated. Second, within trade standard harmonization, a couple of action items are: i) expediting completion of the ASEAN GAqP; and ii) highlighting the issue of small producer inclusion. ASEAN-wide mechanisms toward the inclusion of small producers hold a long-term potential for uplifting the livelihoods of millions of small farmers and fishers in Southeast Asia. However, this cannot follow the same modality as standards certification for large exporting companies. The blueprint objectives for cooperatives, including other types of producer associations, should be reexamined toward more collective approaches to gain approval and certification.

T1  - Farmers' producer companies in India: a new concept for collective action?
AN  - 1496958330; 4517161
AB  - Producer companies can help smallholder farmers participate in emerging high-value markets, such as the export market and the unfolding modern retail sector in India. As elsewhere in the developing world, in India, small farmers' livelihoods are being threatened due to the liberalization and privatization of Indian agriculture and the increasing interest of private capital in the agribusiness sector. The withdrawal of the state from productive and economic functions, and changes in the organization of marketing channels, present new challenges for small-scale farmers. In this environment of greater instability and competition, organization and collective action can help to enhance farmers' competitiveness and increase their advantage in emerging market opportunities. We build on the ideas of value-chain governance and collective-action literature and introduce the functions and organizational structure of producer companies in India within this context. On the basis of a case study of a specific producer company in Maharashtra, which produces and markets mango and cashew nuts, we discuss the potential benefits for rural communities and the reempowering effect of this form of farmer organization.

T1  - Cultivating compliance: governance of north Indian organic basmati smallholders in a global value chain
AN  - 1496952822; 4517379
AB  - Focusing on a global value chain (GVC) for organic basmati rice, we study how farmers' practices are governed through product and process standards, organic certification protocols, and contracts with buyer firms. We analyze how farmers' entry into the GVC reconfigures their agencements (defined as heterogeneous arrangements of human and nonhuman agencies which are associated with each other). These reconfigurations entail the severance of some associations among procedural and material elements of the agencements and the formation of new associations, in order to produce cultivation practices that are accurately described by the GVC's standards and protocols. Based on ethnography of two farmers in Uttarakhand, North India, we find that the same standards were enacted differently on the two farmers' fields, producing variable degrees of (selective) compliance with the 'official' GVC standards. We argue that the disjuncture between the 'official' scripts of the standards and actual cultivation practices must be nurtured to allow farmers' agencements to align their practices with local sociotechnical relations and farm ecology. Furthermore, we find that compliance and disjuncture were facilitated by many practices and associations that were officially ungoverned by the GVC. Reprinted by permission of Pion Limited

T1  - Functioning of farm-grown timber value chains: Lessons from the smallholder-produced teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) poles value chain in Southern Benin
AN  - 1030884520; 2011-222520
AB  - The study examined the functioning of the smallholder-produced teak poles value chain in Southern Benin from an analytical perspective combining the governance structure, the institutional environment, and the distribution of consumer price among chain actors. The objective was to identify bottlenecks militating against improved functioning of the farm-grown timber value chains. A fieldwork was carried from August 2008 to September 2010, to identify the agents and the organisations involved in the value chain. Data were collected on the functions performed, the costs borne and the income received by each category of agent, the marketing channels within the value chain, the interactions among agents, the consumption of the product, and the role of the organisations connected to the value chain. This was done by combining semi-structured interviews, focus group meetings, and structured interviews. In addition, data were collected on the institutional environment from both primary and secondary sources. The following agents were involved in the value chain: nurserymen, planters, local intermediaries, brokers, traders, and consumers. The forest service was the main governmental organisation involved in the functioning of the value chain. The governance structure in the value chain was driven by a mixture of government and the market. Various weaknesses were found in the forest policy, the forest regulation and their implementation. Planters' share of consumer price was lower than traders' return. The relevant policy options to address these issues were discussed. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

T1  - Smallholder Participation in Contract Farming: Comparative Evidence from Five Countries
AN  - 1023034533; 2011-229008
AB  - Supermarkets, specialized wholesalers, processors, and agro-exporters are transforming the marketing channels into which smallholder farmers sell produce in low-income economies. We develop a conceptual framework with which to study contracting between smallholders and a commodity-processing firm. We then synthesize results from empirical studies of contract farming arrangements in five countries (Ghana, India, Madagascar, Mozambique, and Nicaragua). The resulting meta-narrative documents patterns of participation, the welfare gains associated with participation, reasons for nonparticipation, the significant extent of contract noncompliance, and the considerable dynamism of these value chains as farmers and firms enter and exit frequently.

T1  - The mixing of methods: A three-step process for improving rigour in impact evaluations
AN  - 1010708789; 201209682
AB  - This article describes a systematic process that is helpful in improving impact Evaluation assignments, within restricted budgets and timelines. It involves three steps: a rethink of the key questions of the Evaluation to develop more relevant, specific questions; a way of designing a mix of research methods to generate evidence that supports more valid conclusions; and a step that aims to make Evaluation outputs more useful. The approach is illustrated through two examples: one on measuring income impacts in an irrigated horticulture programme in Nepal, Zambia and Ethiopia; and another on the assessment of changes in organizational capacities for collective marketing by smallholders in Bolivia. The article demonstrates that this simple, straightforward and structured three-step process helped to reduce the tendency to one-method designs. Enhanced critical reflection within the team allowed for greater sensitivity to validity threats and the creativity to find ways to handle them.

T1  - Small Farmers and Big Retail: Trade-offs of Supplying Supermarkets in Nicaragua
AN  - 1010641656; 2011-191937
AB  - In Nicaragua and elsewhere in Central America, small-scale farmers are weighing the risks of entering into contracts with supermarket chains. We use unique data from cooperatives supplying supermarkets to study the effect of supply agreements on producers' mean output prices and price stability. We find that prices paid by the domestic retail chain approximate the traditional market in mean and variance while mean prices paid by Walmart are significantly lower than the traditional market. However, the Walmart contract is found to systematically reduce price volatility. We find some evidence, however, that farmers may be paying too much for this contractual insurance against price variation. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Transaction Costs, Institutional Arrangements and Inequality Outcomes: Potato Marketing by Small Producers in Rural Peru
AN  - 1010641654; 2011-191936
AB  - We explore the distributional effects of lowering transaction costs to allow access to improved market opportunities for small farmers in the Peruvian Highlands. We find that when new marketing opportunities arise, those that have more land, are better educated and are well organized are able to deal with the complexities that the new contractual arrangements entail. Although this on average implies an increase in net income for small farmers, it also affects the distribution of earnings, generating a more polarized small farmer economy. To counteract this effect and reduce inequality in the opportunities of less endowed small farmers, complementary policies need to be put in place. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - The added value of technology
AN  - 914991281
AB  - Ghanaian agricultural businesses have many of the key requirements to compete in the global marketplace. The country has a stable government, a favourable growing climate, and good logistical connections -- with two accessible seaports and a direct air service to nearby European and Middle Eastern markets. But to compete globally, exporting businesses need to have a precise understanding of their supply bases if they are to deliver the right amount of produce, on time, at the right volume and be able to trace their goods all the way back to their source. Most of Ghana's agricultural produce is grown by a large number of smallholder farmers, which makes it difficult to trace the entire line of supply back to the original producer. In an effort to promote growth by increasing productivity, the Trade and Investment Programme for a Competitive Export Economy (TIPCEE) focused on developing stronger links between producers and markets.

T1  - Cooperatives, Politics, and Development in Rural Paraguay
AN  - 1022051526
AB  - Although national politics and policies strongly influence how cooperatives function, cooperative organizations and advisors increasingly envision cooperatives as primarily economic organizations and avoid direct political engagement and social mobilization. In this paper, we discuss and challenge the depoliticization of cooperatives based on research into how two Paraguayan cooperatives dealt with the aftermath of a debt forgiveness law for small fanners. The law was a major victory for peasant political organizations, but its benefits did not extend to all smallholders, generating discontent that threatened both cooperatives and their development strategies. The cooperatives' differing responses to these challenges underscore how policy effects and development strategies are shaped by local level decision making based on organizational histories and emergent opportunities. To conclude, we discuss the advantages and challenges of politicizing cooperatives and offer reflections on how these challenges might be overcome. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Strategy for Joint Liability Group Upscaling in Bihar
AN  - 1009903966
AB  - Innovations of credit products and delivery systems, which would help banks to manage transaction costs relating to appraisal and monitoring and which cover default risks and reduce delinquency levels in this niche segment of agriculture credit, have eluded the banking system. National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) started the concept of Joint Liability Group (JLG) in 2004-05 as pilot projects in eight states. Tenant farmers, share croppers, oral lessees, farmers with small holdings without proper land records and the poor who could not form Self-Help Groups (SHGs) for want of numbers and other criteria, can form a JLG. As per rough estimates, about 13,200 JLGs had been financed by various Grameen Banks in Bihar till March 31, 2010. The objective of the study is to study the extent of coverage of JLGs in Bihar, the important issues and problems in the formation and financing of JLGs, impact of JLGs financing to small and marginal farmers and agricultural laborers and to formulate a strategy for scaling up of JLG in Bihar. The study suggests a proactive role of the state government and NABARD in increasing the loan amount per borrower and the capacity building of groups to develop group dynamics. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Partial Vertical Integration, Risk Shifting, and Product Rejection in the High-Value Export Supply Chain: The Ghana Pineapple Sector
AN  - 919902413; 201203169
AB  - High-value export supply chains hold potential to improve smallholders' welfare, but their relative production inefficiency and moral hazard problems can cause exporters to prefer vertically integrated plantation production. However, pineapple exporters in Ghana produce both for their own account and purchase from smallholders. We hypothesize that vertical integration is only partial because exporters face large market risks that smallholders, surprisingly, are better able to absorb. We show empirically that exporters' average rejection rate of export-quality fruit is high and varies in response to unanticipated fluctuations in European demand. These results support the hypothesis and are consistent with theories of partial vertical integration but not the standard principal-agent paradigm. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - A systems and partnership approach to agricultural research for development: lessons from Ethiopia
AN  - 905209917; 4249802
AB  - In spite of the availability of several improved agricultural technologies generated by the research system in Ethiopia over the last four decades, adoption of these innovations by smallholder farmers has been very low. This has led to stagnation of agricultural productivity and low crop yields, exposing the country to recurrent food shortfalls and national food insecurity. The old approach to agricultural research emphasized developing new technologies mainly through on-station research that were then supposed to reach farmers through the public-sector extension system. The Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR) has in recent years introduced a shift in agricultural research for development, which is based on the innovation systems approach that involved cultivating partnerships with several actors along the value chain, especially farmers, farmers' cooperatives and input suppliers. This paper presents the methodology used to facilitate agricultural innovations and the diffusion of new technologies and illustrates the outcomes of this initiative with regard to technology adoption, productivity growth and the market orientation of production. The authors use examples from experiences in scaling up three grain legumes. Compared to the three-year baseline average (2003-05), crop output increased nationally by 89%, 85% and 97% in 2008 for common bean, chickpea and lentil respectively. Nationally, 53-59% of the output growth is attributable to yield growth due to technological change, while the balance is due to area expansion. These results affirm that the new approach has led to accelerated adoption of new and high-yielding or low-risk varieties. Reprinted by permission of IP Publishing Ltd

T1  - Beyond the vertical? Using value chains and governance as a framework to analyse private standards initiatives in agri-food chains
AN  - 880027275
AB  - The significance of private standards and associated local level initiatives in agri-food value chains are increasingly recognised. However whilst issues related to compliance and impact at the smallholder or worker level have frequently been analysed, the governance implications in terms of how private standards affect national level institutions, public, private and non-governmental, have had less attention. This article applies an extended value chain framework for critical analysis of Private Standards Initiatives (PSI) in agrifood chains, drawing on primary research on PSIs operating in Kenyan horticulture (Horticulture Ethical Business Initiative and KenyaGAP). The paper explores the legislative, executive and judicial aspects of governance in these southern PSIs highlighting how different stakeholders shape debates and act with agency. It is argued that governance is exercised 'beyond the vertical' in that one can identify wider horizontal processes of governance, including how the scope of key debates is constructed (especially in legislative governance) but analysis of executive governance emphasises the dominant role of the lead buyers.

T1  - Partial Vertical Integration, Risk Shifting, and Product Rejection in the High-Value Export Supply Chain: The Ghana Pineapple Sector
AN  - 1728653208; 2011-161913
AB  - High-value export supply chains hold potential to improve smallholders' welfare, but their relative production inefficiency and moral hazard problems can cause exporters to prefer vertically integrated plantation production. However, pineapple exporters in Ghana produce both for their own account and purchase from smallholders. We hypothesize that vertical integration is only partial because exporters face large market risks that smallholders, surprisingly, are better able to absorb. We show empirically that exporters' average rejection rate of export-quality fruit is high and varies in response to unanticipated fluctuations in European demand. These results support the hypothesis and are consistent with theories of partial vertical integration but not the standard principal-agent paradigm. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Global Questions, Local Answers: Soil Management and Sustainable Intensification in Diverse Socioeconomic Contexts of Cuba
AN  - 881501131
AB  - In the complex context of global food and agricultural systems, research in agriculture must respond to multidisciplinary questions of economic development, ecological sustainability and food justice. With the objective of responding to several of the most important questions facing agriculture today, this article describes recent research in three Cuban cropping systems: state farms, cooperatives, and small family farmers. Soil management is considered here as a crux of human intervention in agroecosystems, capable of determining the impacts of productive activities upon agricultural and ecosystem functions. Management practices commonly used in each farm system are evaluated using two systems of indicators, one for technological quality and one for agricultural intensification. Soil physical quality is characterized through laboratory analysis of samples taken in the same type of soil under long-term production in state, cooperative, and family farmer cropping systems. Soil structure management in the small farmer system is especially worthy of study, because this agricultural system has developed an intensive agroecological productive model on the basis of low external input use, polycultures and internal nutrient cycling. Favorable policies and farmer organizations are discussed as indispensible elements of sustainable agricultural development. The relationships between soil management, local knowledge, and food access are explored in the Cuban context and as directions for food system studies. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - A set of factors has led the small farmer settlements to organize themselves into associations in order to generate income and quality of life. Among them, the rise of agribusiness managed by its members aimed at enhancement of production. This research focuses on identifying the strategic behavior of Cooperative Marketing in the Far West - Cooperoeste responsible for the industrialization of long life milk Terra Viva, located in So Miguel do Oeste - Santa Catarina. The study considered the company's history, and define the relevant periods and characterizing them according to the typology of Miles and Snow. It is a single case study, a descriptive, qualitative approach, carried out through interviews with two people who had substantial involvement in company history. From the analysis of data collected, it was found that the Cooperoeste had the predominant strategic behavior analyst. It was shown also that at various times, stood the entrepreneurial attitude resulting from managers who are aware of changes and seek to adapt to the scenario of innovation, even working in an environment with risk, uncertainty and volatility. It was concluded that the company adopted the strategy in adaptive mode and, consequently, set the environment for strategic decision regarding the interpretation of business problems. Throughout history the predominant engineering and administrative problems. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Multi-stakeholder platforms for linking small farmers to value chains: evidence from the Andes
AN  - 1461656332
AB  - Value chains linked to urban markets and agro-industry present new opportunities for adding value and raising rural incomes. Small farmers, who produce small volumes, struggle to enter these markets. A lack of trust among value chain actors increases transaction costs and short-circuits innovation. This paper explores how multi-stakeholder platforms have been used to address these problems in potato-based value chains in Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador. It uses the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework to understand how platforms work. Differences in characteristics of the value chains, the participating actors and institutional arrangements have led to the emergence of two types of platforms. The first type brings traders, processors, supermarkets and others together with farmer associations and research and development (R&D) organizations to foster the development of new market opportunities through commercial, institutional and technological innovation. The second type is structured around geographically delimited supply areas, meshing farmers and service providers to address market governance issues in assuring volumes, meeting quality and timeliness constraints and empowering farmers. Evidence from these cases indicates that platforms that bring stakeholders together around value chains can result in new products, processes, norms and behaviours that benefit poor farmers, which could not have been achieved otherwise.

AN  - 1943872590
AB  - In the Northwest of México the increase in the agricultural productivity in the years between 1940 and 1970, was due to the expansion of the farming lands, the use of improved seeds and fertilizer, mechanization, the greater availability of credit, the irrigation system and road improvement. The important intervention from the Mexican state to implement policies of investment with the support of internationally development agencies, and grant credit facilities for the development of agriculture trough the creation of official agricultural banks and the facilities to the constitution of private commercial banks. After the disarticulation of the bank in México due to the revolution, is advanced with steady steps in restructuring the banking system with the creation of a new banking law, the foundation of Banco de México and the Comision Nacional Bancaria in 1924; Banco Nacional de Credito Agricola (1926), the Banco Nacional de Credito Ejidal (1935), Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior (1937) and the Banco Nacional Agropecuario (1965), which gave financial support to small farmers and ejidatarios (members of a cooperative). The main farmers of Sinaloa and Sonora in collaboration with the federal government through the Comision Monetaria and the Banco de México founded the Banco de Sinaloa and Banco Agricola Sonorense in 1933. Explain the impact these financial institutions had in the agricultural credit of Sinaloa and Sonora will be the central objective of this work.

T1  - Profits and poverty: Certification's troubled link for Nicaragua's organic and fairtrade coffee producers
AN  - 881464563; 2011-110836
AB  - Governments, donors and NGOs have promoted environmental and social certification schemes for coffee producers as certified market channels are assumed to offer higher prices and better incomes. Additionally, it is presumed that these certifications contribute to poverty reduction of smallholders. Yet, gross margins, profits and poverty levels of certified smallholder coffee producers have not yet been quantitatively analyzed applying random sampling techniques. Our quantitative household survey of 327 randomly selected members of conventional, organic and organic-fairtrade certified cooperatives in Nicaragua is complemented by over a hundred qualitative in-depth interviews. The results show that although farm-gate prices of certified coffees are higher than of conventional coffees, the profitability of certified coffee production and its subsequent effect on poverty levels is not clear-cut. Per capita net coffee incomes are insufficient to cover basic needs of all coffee producing households. Certified producers are more often found below the absolute poverty line than conventional producers. Over a period of ten years, our analysis shows that organic and organic-fairtrade farmers have become poorer relative to conventional producers. We conclude that coffee yield levels, profitability and efficiency need to be increased, because prices for certified coffee cannot compensate for low productivity, land or labor constraints.

T1  - Profits and poverty: certification's troubled link for Nicaragua's organic and fairtrade coffee producers
AN  - 865527006; 4192683
AB  - Governments, donors and NGOs have promoted environmental and social certification schemes for coffee producers as certified market channels are assumed to offer higher prices and better incomes. Additionally, it is presumed that these certifications contribute to poverty reduction of smallholders. Yet, gross margins, profits and poverty levels of certified smallholder coffee producers have not yet been quantitatively analyzed applying random sampling techniques. Our quantitative household survey of 327 randomly selected members of conventional, organic and organic-fairtrade certified cooperatives in Nicaragua is complemented by over a hundred qualitative in-depth interviews. The results show that although farm-gate prices of certified coffees are higher than of conventional coffees, the profitability of certified coffee production and its subsequent effect on poverty levels is not clear-cut. Per capita net coffee incomes are insufficient to cover basic needs of all coffee producing households. Certified producers are more often found below the absolute poverty line than conventional producers. Over a period of ten years, our analysis shows that organic and organic-fairtrade farmers have become poorer relative to conventional producers. We conclude that coffee yield levels, profitability and efficiency need to be increased, because prices for certified coffee cannot compensate for low productivity, land or labor constraints.

T1  - FAMILY FARMING AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION: THE EMERGENCE AND DECLINE OF AGRARIAN CONDOMINIOS IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL
AN  - 1026588894
AB  - In this work the authors analyze the Condominios as an example of economic cooperation adapted to the characteristics of family farming in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. The process of modernization of Brazilian agriculture that took place in the 1960s and 1970s under the military governments is analyzed with special attention to the selective and exclusionary effects this process had on the small farmers, along with a study of the development of cooperativism. The consolidation of macro-cooperative models demonstrated reflect the interests and characteristics of modernized, export-oriented agriculture. The origins and development of Condominios as an alternative to the large agricultural cooperatives in Santa Catarina are also addressed. Finally, the authors discuss these models of association, which are adapted to the characteristics of small producers, and place them in Chayanov's views on family farming and the peasantry.

T1  - Centering labor in the land grab debate
AN  - 902083061; 201123092
AB  - Placing labor at the center of the global 'land-grab' debate helps sharpen critical insights at two scales. At the scale of agricultural enterprises, a labor perspective highlights the jobs generated, and the rewards received, by people who work in and around large farms. This approach guides my critical reading of the report prepared by a World Bank team that argues for large-scale land acquisition as a way to reduce poverty. Using data from within the report itself, I show why poverty reduction is a very unlikely result. I develop the argument further by drawing on research in colonial and contemporary Indonesia, where large-scale plantations and associated smallholder contract schemes have a long history. A labor perspective is also relevant at the national and transnational scale, where it highlights the predicament of people whose labor is not needed by the global capitalist system. In much of the global South, the anticipated transition from the farm to factory has not taken place and education offers no solution, as vast numbers of educated people are unemployed. Unless vast numbers of jobs are created, or a global basic income grant is devised to redistribute the wealth generated in highly productive but labor-displacing ventures, any program that robs rural people of their foothold on the land must be firmly rejected.

T1  - A confluence of Fair Trade and organic agriculture in southern India
AN  - 869403723; 4198970
AB  - Although the confluence of Fair Trade and organic agriculture has become a salient phenomenon, they contradict each other at the production level: Fair Trade focuses on specific products, while organic agriculture targets production units. This article explores how Southern small-scale producers cope with this discrepancy, by observing one farmers' group's attempt to obtain the two certifications in India. This case study identifies stakeholders who react to the two certifications differently under different livelihood strategies. Combining the two initiatives may not always be the best practice for realising poverty reduction and environmental conservation - aims which the initiatives have in common.

T1  - Marketing cooperative vs. commission agent: The Turkish dilemma on the modern fresh fruit and vegetable market
AN  - 863148696
AB  - In Turkey, the Wholesale Markets Law was enacted in 1995 to facilitate small-scale growers' access to the fresh produce market. Cooperatives and commission agents have thus become the main marketing structures available to small-scale fresh produce growers, to supply supermarkets and comply with their new requirements. In this paper, we question the advantages and disadvantages that confront small farmers with respect to those marketing structures to allow for market matching or quality upgrading. Drawing on ownership and transaction cost arguments, we use an analytical framework to identify and compare the costs of these marketing organizations. Based on data collected through a large number of interviews with stakeholders, we show that commission agents and credit cooperatives tend to be more efficient than traditional cooperatives as regards sales performance and decision costs. However, the lack of apparent competition between commission agents does not allow for sufficient provision of incentives for producers to invest in high-quality production. Consequently, credit cooperatives are the only structure progressively turning to strategies of quality upgrading and supermarket supply. The flipside of such strategies is that they may lead to the marginalization of small-scale farmers. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Centering labor in the land grab debate
AN  - 866352422
AB  - Placing labor at the center of the global 'land-grab' debate helps sharpen critical insights at two scales. At the scale of agricultural enterprises, a labor perspective highlights the jobs generated, and the rewards received, by people who work in and around large farms. This approach guides my critical reading of the report prepared by a World Bank team that argues for large-scale land acquisition as a way to reduce poverty. Using data from within the report itself, I show why poverty reduction is a very unlikely result. I develop the argument further by drawing on research in colonial and contemporary Indonesia, where large-scale plantations and associated smallholder contract schemes have a long history. A labor perspective is also relevant at the national and transnational scale, where it highlights the predicament of people whose labor is not needed by the global capitalist system. In much of the global South, the anticipated transition from the farm to factory has not taken place and education offers no solution, as vast numbers of educated people are unemployed. Unless vast numbers of jobs are created, or a global basic income grant is devised to redistribute the wealth generated in highly productive but labor-displacing ventures, any program that robs rural people of their foothold on the land must be firmly rejected.

T1  - Globalisation and poverty in Senegal: a worst case scenario?
AN  - 865525430; 4192573
AB  - There is no consensus about how globalisation - trade and foreign investments - affects poverty reduction. Using household survey data, this study contributes to the empirical literature on globalisation and poverty by analysing the household-level implications of increased foreign investments and trade in the horticulture sector in Senegal. In many aspects this represents what many would consider a 'worst-case scenario'. Stringent rich country standards are imposed on exports and the supply chain is controlled by a single multinational company with extreme levels of supply base consolidation and vertical integration and complete exclusion of smallholder suppliers. We analyse and quantify income and poverty effects under these 'worst-case conditions' and find significant positive welfare impacts through employment creation and labour market participation.

T1  - How standards compete: comparative impact of coffee certification schemes in Northern Nicaragua
AN  - 857714873
AB  - Purpose - Smallholder farmers are increasingly subject to different types of standards that offer specific conditions for their market incorporation. The proliferation of private and voluntary (civic) standards raises questions regarding their impact on farmers' welfare and their role in the upgrading of value chains. This paper aims to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach - Based on extensive fieldwork and careful matching of 315 farmers in Northern Nicaragua who produce coffee under Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance and Café Practices labels or deliver to independent traders, the effects on income, production and investments are compared. Moreover, the implications of different contract conditions for risk behaviour, organizational force, loyalty and gender attitudes are assessed. Findings - The paper finds that Fair Trade provides better prices compared with independent producers, but private labels out-compete Fair Trade in terms of yield and quality performance. While Fair Trade can be helpful to support initial market incorporation, private labels offer more suitable incentives for quality upgrading. Research limitations/implications - Civic standards exhibit major effects on local institutions' and farmers' behaviour, while B2B standards are more effective for improving production and management practices. Dynamic improvement standards may bridge the gap between both. Practical implications - Fair Trade standards are useful to provide initial market access to small-holders, but private standards offer better prospects for subsequent quality upgrading. Originality/value - This is the first large-scale comparative impact assessment of coffee standards that delivers unbiased empirical results. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Marketing cooperative vs. commission agent: The Turkish dilemma on the modern fresh fruit and vegetable market
AN  - 901751706; 2011-118806
AB  - In Turkey, the Wholesale Markets Law was enacted in 1995 to facilitate small-scale growers' access to the fresh produce market. Cooperatives and commission agents have thus become the main marketing structures available to small-scale fresh produce growers, to supply supermarkets and comply with their new requirements. In this paper, we question the advantages and disadvantages that confront small farmers with respect to those marketing structures to allow for market matching or quality upgrading. Drawing on ownership and transaction cost arguments, we use an analytical framework to identify and compare the costs of these marketing organizations. Based on data collected through a large number of interviews with stakeholders, we show that commission agents and credit cooperatives tend to be more efficient than traditional cooperatives as regards sales performance and decision costs. However, the lack of apparent competition between commission agents does not allow for sufficient provision of incentives for producers to invest in high-quality production. Consequently, credit cooperatives are the only structure progressively turning to strategies of quality upgrading and supermarket supply. The flipside of such strategies is that they may lead to the marginalization of small-scale farmers. Research highlights: Commission agents do not provide farmers with incentives for adding value. Traditional coops remain costly to organize. Credit coops are the only structure turning to strategies of supermarket supply. Credit coop organization may put the less efficient farmers at risk of exclusion. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

T1  - Collective livestock research for sustainable disease management in Mali and Burkina Faso
AN  - 886578692
AB  - An international multi-disciplinary team of scientists, led by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), tackled the problem of bovine trypanosomosis and the development of drug resistance in West Africa, inter alia, by the promotion of rational drug use (RDU) principles. These principles had been brought to farmers by practical training and by the provision of information leaflets. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of RDU training at smallholder level with respect to advances in farmers' knowledge and farm productivity before research outputs could be scaled up. Therefore, 508 cattle farmers attended a disease-specific knowledge test and provided information about farm production. Results show that farmers who participated in the training are more likely to identify signs and causes of the disease and to correctly administer drugs. Allocating scores to each question in the knowledge tests and scrutinizing the differences between trained and untrained farmers by matching procedures shows that participating farmers reach higher scores in all knowledge categories. Moreover, the acquisition of additional knowledge and the application of improved control strategies significantly increase farm performance. Additionally, an allocative effect was identified since trypanocide expenditures were saved by less expensive inputs. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - African indigenous vegetable enterprises and market access for small-scale farmers in East Africa
AN  - 886558692
AB  - African indigenous vegetables (AIVs) have been part of the food systems in sub-Saharan Africa for generations. The region is a natural habitat for more than 45,000 species of plants, of which about 1,000 can be eaten as green leafy or fruit vegetables that happen to be the mainstay of traditional diets. During the colonial era, adventurers and slavers sailing in Africa introduced exotic plants such as maize, cassava and beans and, later, commercial crops such as sugarcane, cocoa, coffee and cotton, which began contributing more to life. Farmers integrated these crops into their age-old livelihood strategies at the expense of traditional subsistence crops. AIVs were almost entirely neglected and considered 'poor people's' plants. To reverse the trend, FARM-Africa and its partners reintroduced AIVs which are now forming part of families' diets as well as becoming a source of income for smallholder farmers in Arumeru, Tanzania and Kiambu, Kenya. AIVs are robust and productive, and thus well suited to feeding the hungriest and most vulnerable sections of society. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

This paper describes the outcomes of this approach and explains the extent to which it has been taken up and has led to sustained and self-generated capacity. Based in particular on experience in Malawi, Ghana and Cameroon, it also considers implications more widely in the region. The overall picture is that this is a partial and still emerging success story, linked as much with the social and economic drivers surrounding smallholder farmers as with the development support approach adopted.

T1  - Area-Yield Crop Insurance Reconsidered (Again): An Empirical Analysis of Demand for Area Yield Insurance for Rice Farmers in Peru
AN  - 878958900
AB  - Yield risk is a particularly damaging fact of life for farmers in developing countries, who tend to possess neither sufficient assets nor access to financial safety nets to withstand crop failure. In recent years, policy-makers and researchers have focused significant attention on developing index-based insurance markets as a means of enhancing small-holders' risk mitigation capacity in developing countries. Low transactions costs and minimal asymmetric information problems confer potentially large advantages to index insurance compared to conventional, multi-peril crop insurance. This thesis re-examines the microeconomic framework underlying area yield insurance, a common type of index insurance, and expands the framework by incorporating two factors that have been neglected but are particularly relevant in developing countries: loading costs and informal risk-sharing arrangements that may interact with index insurance. Much of the theoretical literature exploring area yield insurance has assumed actuarially fair premiums. Both of the above-mentioned factors, however, raise the effective insurance premium above the actuarially fair level. I show why moving towards the more realistic portrayal of area yield contracts complicates the analysis of insurance demand, requiring additional information on (or assumptions about) key farmer characteristics such as risk preferences and wealth.

T1  - Inclusive neoliberalism? Perspectives from Eastern Caribbean farmers
AN  - 848679544; 4158622
AB  - Banana farming in the Eastern Caribbean has gone from riches to rags since the 1990s, as the region's economic and social mainstay has severely contracted. This article reports on interviews conducted at the grassroots level with about 150 current or former banana farmers in Dominica and St. Lucia, and at the administrative level with numerous government and banana sector officials and other stakeholders. The interviews sought to answer two interrelated questions: ( a ) How have farmers experienced and responded to this severe contraction in the banana export industry? and ( b ) To what extent does current development policy support farmers' economic needs? Indeed, many of the stated goals of the current development paradigm, referred to as 'inclusive neoliberalism', align with the farmers' stated needs. We seek to understand the extent to which this development policy manifests itself at the grassroots level in the form of support that small farmers can actually use to help sell their products. Our interviews document multiple ways that banana farmers have been hurt by changes in international trade policy. The interviews also reveal a considerable gap between the stated desires and development policy priorities of farmers, on the one hand, and the impacts of development policy at the grassroots level, on the other. We conclude with suggestions on how to bridge the gap between inclusive neoliberal development policy and the needs of small farmers, who for decades have been the social and economic bedrock of Eastern Caribbean societies.

T1  - Women and fair trade coffee production in Nicaragua
AN  - 2488768393
AB  - Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in Latin America with a population of 5.8 million of whom just over half are women. Systems such as Fair Trade allow consumers to express concern and take action by utilizing their purchasing power to help small scale producers. If Fair Trade is understood correctly, the system will be more affective at both ends of the supply chain, from the producer to the consumer. Yet, it has long been understood that the benefits of development do not always trickle down equally to both men and women. This paper argues that Fair Trade can make an impact on women and it must be analyzed through a gendered lens as in a case study of a coffee Fair Trade cooperative in Nicaragua. This study shows that the SOPPEXCCA cooperative would not have been such a success for women farmers without being a part of Fair Trade, which provides the means by which women are empowered as producers, mothers, and community members. Though, it is not Fair Trade alone that has created this success. It is the hard work and determination of the cooperative staff and the female producers themselves. The recent history of dictatorship, revolution, civil war and the feminist movement in Nicaragua set the stage for the cooperative to make physical and mental changes for cooperative members a more realistic endeavour.

T1  - Dasar Wawasan Negara dan prospek pembangunan petani kecil Melayu (The Malaysian National Vision Policy and the advancement prospects of the Malay small-scale farmers)
AN  - 2488767964
AB  - Sejarah pasca merdeka Malaysia menunjukkan bahawa pembangunan petani kecil Melayu adalah matlamat yang masih elusif. Ianya merupakan fenomena pasang surut selaras dengan naik turun martabat sektor pertanian itu sendiri. Semasa zaman Tun Razak (1957 – 1976) pembangunan petani kecil Melayu berjalan lancar. Semaza zaman Tun Mahathir (1991-2000) ianya merudum. Kemudian ekoran Krisis Ekonomi 1997 dan mulai 2003 Dasar Wawasan Negara (DWN) yang juga mencakupi Dasar Pertanian Negara ke-3 (DPN 3) menempatkan semula sektor pertanian sebagai enjin pertumbuhan ekonomi negara, dan dengan itu mencerahkan semula prospek pembangunan petani kecil Melayu. Kertas ini bertujuan membicarakan prospek pembangunan petani kecil Melayu dalam fasa DWN, khususnya dalam konteks perlaksanaan dua program berimpak tinggi iaitu Pelan Tindakan Imbangan Perdagangan (BOT) dan Pertanian Kontrak di mana pembangunan agro-makanan yang merupakan niche petani kecil Melayu menjadi agenda utama dan menjanjikan lonjakan taraf petani kecil kepada usahawan global. Hasil penelitian mendapati bahawa
prestasi BOT dan Pertanian Kontrak setakat ini tidaklah begitu memberangsangkan . Dengan kata lain prospek memajukan petani kecil Melayu masih meragukan. Punca utama ialah lemahnya kemampuan petani kecil Melayu dalam pemasaran tani. Kesimpulannya, sejauhmana prospek pembangunan petani kecil Melayu dapat dicerahkan selanjutnya adalah bergantung kepada kesanggupan negara bergigih mendidik budaya pengurusan pemasaran kepada petani kecil Melayu.Alternate abstract:Malaysia’s post independence history indicates that the dreamed goal of creating highly accomplished Malay small-scale farmers had been an elusive one. It waxed and waned with the status accorded to the country’s agricultural sector. In glowed in Tun Razak time (1957 – 1976) and dimmed in Tun Mahathir era (1981-2000). Then, beginning 2003 and as the aftermath of the 1997 Asian Economic Crisis, the newly
minted National Vision Policy (NVP) which incorporated the Third National Agriculture Policy had reinstated agriculture as a growth sector, and thus rekindled the hope. This paper examines the prospects of developing the Malay small farmers in this NVP phase. The focus was the implementation of two high impact programmes enshrined in the NVP, namely, the Balance of Trade Action (BOT) Plan and the Contract Farming Project in which the development of the agro-food subsector which represents the very niche of the Malay small farmers constitutes the main agenda and promises to relaunch the farmers onto becoming global agropreneurs. The results found the performance of the two high impact programmes least encouraging. In other words, the prospects of developing the Malay small farmers remain uncertain
and doubtful. Weakness in agriculture marketing seems to be the root of their undoing. In conclusion, improving the prospects of developing the Malay small farmers in this NVP era calls for the nurturing of the marketing savviness in them.

T1  - HOW TO INCREASE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF SMALL SOY FARMERS IN PARAGUAY
AN  - 2108767333
AB  - Soybean is today the most traded commodity in the global market. Soy is a plant of great importance to human nutrition, animal feed and industries. Based on research efforts conducted in the main soy producing region in Paraguay, the study aimed to characterize the agents involved in the national soy industry and present an overview of the relations between them, particularly between business companies and farmers, with emphasis on small farmers. Emphasis will be given to contractual relations and how they impact the activity. The results indicate that contractual arrangements, formal or not, are tools that contribute to stable relations between the parties, especially in a business so dependent on exogenous factors, as is the case of agriculture. Therefore, it is crucial that the public and/or private organizations encourage the use of contracts to reduce costs and keep the agents in the productive activity.

T1  - Cooperatives, politics, and development in rural Paraguay
AN  - 1845055792; 2014-15278-003
AB  - Although national politics and policies strongly influence how cooperatives function, cooperative organizations and advisors increasingly envision cooperatives as primarily economic organizations and avoid direct political engagement and social mobilization. In this paper, we discuss and challenge the depoliticization of cooperatives based on research into how two Paraguayan cooperatives dealt with the aftermath of a debt forgiveness law for small farmers. The law was a major victory for peasant political organizations, but its benefits did not extend to all smallholders, generating discontent that threatened both cooperatives and their development strategies. The cooperatives’ differing responses to these challenges underscore how policy effects and development strategies are shaped by local level decision making based on organizational histories and emergent opportunities. To conclude, we discuss the advantages and challenges of politicizing cooperatives and offer reflections on how these challenges might be overcome.

AB  - Although national politics and policies strongly influence how cooperatives function, cooperative organizations and advisors increasingly envision cooperatives as primarily economic organizations and avoid direct political engagement and social mobilization. In this paper, we discuss and challenge the depoliticization of cooperatives based on research into how two Paraguayan cooperatives dealt with the aftermath of a debt forgiveness law for small farmers. The law was a major victory for peasant political organizations, but its benefits did not extend to all smallholders, generating discontent that threatened both cooperatives and their development strategies. The cooperatives' differing responses to these challenges underscore how policy effects and development strategies are shaped by local level decision making based on organizational histories and emergent opportunities.

T1  - Indian companies engaged in agricultural land grabbing in Africa: the need for Indo-African solidarity linkages
AN  - 1022118274; 4306561
AB  - Indian agricultural companies have been involved in the recent trend in large-scale overseas acquisitions of farmland, criticized as land grabbing. India has joined China, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and South Korea among other nations heavily investing in large-scale agricultural projects in Africa and elsewhere. Several factors are driving India's effort to outsource its food production, including the Governments growing strategic concerns about ensuring long-term food security and concerns about falling ground water tables. Eager developing country governments have also courted Indian agricultural investors, offering special incentives, including offers to lease massive tracts of arable land on very generous terms at much cheaper rates than land and water in India. The Indian Government has supported this trend through high level trade diplomacy, foreign aid, and subsidized credit for its agricultural companies investing overseas. Critics call the trend land grabbing and claim there have been negative impacts on local peoples, who are often displaced in the process. The public disclosure of lease contracts between the Ethiopian Government and five Indian investors sheds light on the negative ethical, political, human rights and environmental consequences for local people in host countries. New and ongoing advocacy strategies are discussed, including the idea to establish international advocacy linkages between Indian activists fighting for small farmers rights and addressing land grabbing actions within India, and small farmers in Africa and elsewhere facing similar problems. One idea is for such linkages to inform Indian citizens who can take action to address the problem of land-grabbing by Indian companies operating overseas. International land rights advocates see a common struggle in which land deals must involve transparent and participatory relations between governments, companies and local democratic communities.

T1  - Family Farming and Economic Cooperation: The Emergence and Decline of Agrarian Condominios in Southern Brazil
AN  - 1010630842; 201211275
AB  - In this work the authors analyze the Condominios as an example of economic cooperation adapted to the characteristics of family farming in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina. The process of modernization of Brazilian agriculture that took place in the 1960s and 1970s under the military governments is analyzed with special attention to the selective and exclusionary effects this process had on the small farmers, along with a study of the development of cooperativism. The consolidation of macro-cooperative models demonstrated reflect the interests and characteristics of modernized, export-oriented agriculture. The origins and development of Condominios as an alternative to the large agricultural cooperatives in Santa Catarina are also addressed. Finally, the authors discuss these models of association, which are adapted to the characteristics of small producers, and place them in Chayanovs views on family farming and the peasantry.

T1  - Small holder's carbon forestry project in Haryana India: issues and challenges
AN  - 807506556
AB  - The small scale forestry carbon project in Haryana, India has been registered as a Clean Development Project (CDM) activity and is the first such projects from India. Developed under the Kyoto Protocol of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the projects aims at restoring heavily degraded sandune affected private lands and contribute to climate change mitigation. The project is expected to sequester 234,584 tons of carbon dioxide (tCO^sup 2^) in 20 years project cycle with an average annual sequestration of 11,729 (tCO^sup 2^) per year. The project is expected to have a total carbon stock of 385,253.1 ton Carbon (tC) in the project life span of 20 years as against 7,920.6 (tC) in the baseline scenario. The carbon credits earned from the project is supposed to provide additional incentives to the smallholders who have formed a cooperative society for this purpose. This paper addresses the issues and challenges in developing the project activity and also discusses the lessons learned in the process. The project is supposed to help in poverty alleviation and has become a success story for rehabilitating degraded lands in semi arid regions of India through plantation forestry.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 2018995962
AB  - Utilization and repayment of borrowed agricultural funds has been one of the numerous of agricultural development in the developing world and Nigeria is no exception. As such, this study delved into the determinants of loan repayment performance among farmers in Afikpo North Local Government Area (LGA) of Ebonyi State, Nigeria. The study employed purposive sampling technique in the selection of location and respondents. A sample of 100 small holder agricultural loan beneficiaries from Nigeria Agricultural Cooperative and Rural Development Bank (NACRDB) served as respondents for the study. A set of pretested and structured questionnaire was used to elicit data and information from the respondents. Data were analyzed using discriminant analysis. The discriminant function analysis result showed that 72% of the beneficiaries were operating performing loans while 28% were non-performing loan beneficiaries. On the basis of the results, the study suggested extensive loan periods and adoption of income support measures as panacea for efficient credit delivery and utilization among farmers.Alternate abstract:L'utilisation et le remboursement de fonds agricoles empruntés ont été un des nombreux de développement agricole dans le monde et Nigéria en voie de développement n'est pas d'exception.

T1  - Fair Bananas! Farmers, Workers, and Consumers Strive to Change an Industry
AN  - 763167617
AB  - [...]transnational companies such as Dole and Chiquita were constructing an image of corporate social responsibility with environmental and social accountability certification, and on several occasions signed accords on labour issues with international union associations.

[...]they continued with specific race-to-the bottom-strategies such as shifting production to national growers (which may deteriorate labour conditions and deter free unionization), reducing the number of permanent labourers, increasing the use of labour contractors (lowering wages, reducing benefits), imposing piece pay arrangements, and reducing traditional benefits (such as housing).

Frundt describes the gradual creation of a shared identity among fair trade organizations and unions based on improved labour conditions and unionization in fair trade certified production units, a shift from nonunionized to unionized banana in the fair trade market, support from the international labour movement for smallholder agriculture with fair producer prices, and a restored role for legal mechanisms to protect labourers on large estates.

T1  - The Rough Road to Gender Equitable Growth: The Case of Cafe de Mujer Guatemala
AN  - 758126527; 201060127
AB  - Women worldwide are contributing significantly to global economic growth but do not always receive the benefits needed to improve their own & their family's livelihoods. Women's contributions are often invisible, unrecognized & undervalued. This is especially apparent in global value chains, where harsh labour conditions in export-oriented sectors such as horticulture & the garment industry are well-documented in the literature. However, we still know very little about the agricultural sector, particularly smallholder agriculture & the contribution & position of women. Noortje Verhart & Rhiannon Pyburn use a value chain approach to look at opportunities to improve women's positions in global trade relations. Noortje Verhart & Rhiannon Pyburn illustrate that trade & trade relations are not gender neutral: they influence men's & women's opportunities to improve their position in a value chain quite differently. They demonstrate how a particular intervention in a global coffee chain is enabling the revaluation of women's contribution to coffee production. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Importance of Assessing Marketing Preferences of Small-scale Farmers: A Latent Segment Approach
AN  - 747115295
AB  - This study uses a stated choice-based conjoint model to explore the marketing preferences of small-scale producers of fresh fruits and vegetables in Honduras. A total of eight attributes, proposed in hypothetical contracts to farmers, are evaluated. About two-thirds of farmers show preferences for traditional marketing systems, whereas one-third prefer new marketing channels associated with supermarkets. A latent segment approach, however, reveals significant levels of preference heterogeneity among small-scale farmers. The results suggest the importance of taking into account preference heterogeneity using latent classes in the development of policies aimed at linking small-scale farmers with new agri-food supply chains.

T1  - Certified organic agriculture in China and Brazil: Market accessibility and outcomes following adoption
AN  - 742950136; 2010-563169
AB  - Based on three case studies in China and Brazil, this paper explores the terms of access for farmers' participation in certified organic agriculture (OA) and investigates the influence of adoption on productivity, nutrient budgets, income and labour use. Small-scale farmers converting to OA require substantial external production-related, marketing and certification support. Access to OA was strongly dependent upon the type of support available to farmers. Organization based on a contract-farming model resulted in OA only being an option available to a narrow group of farmers, whilst OA initiated by a farmer cooperative provided better access. Gross output was significantly higher for oranges, whilst for the other crops gross output was similar. However, organic farmers in China felt that adoption had improved prices, incomes and market access. Farmers' perception of improved incomes is probably due to improved market access coupled with either a large production base, production intensification and production diversification. This study demonstrates that organization of farmers, and the manner in which this is structured, is crucial for external support to have an effect. Thus, OA may be a development path for small farmers if the supporting structures are provided at a small financial interest rate. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

T1  - Smallholder Farmers and Maize in Mexico: A Value-Chain Approach to Improved Targeting of Crop-Breeding Programs
AN  - 1027750157
AB  - Research on agricultural value chains can identify strategies for farmers to improve their incomes and livelihood security. The trend in such research, however, has often been to focus on making the chains more effective and efficient via improvements in the relationships between chain actors. Value-chain research has less frequently been applied to the seed sector in identifying how plant breeding can best produce seeds that generate a product with the quality characteristics demanded by output markets. In this article, we report on a research initiative to support maize-seed improvement for the central highlands of Mexico. The research was designed to identify quality traits, demanded in regional maize markets, to add to the list of targeted traits which typically guide plant breeding. We report on the methodological approach and the research findings. We then discuss how these findings are being integrated into ongoing maize-breeding programs for the central highlands of Mexico. We suggest that a value-chain analysis can provide useful guidance to crop-breeding programs, providing plant breeders with information on agronomic characteristics required by producers and quality traits demanded by the market.

T1  - Embedding Local Places in Global Spaces: Geographical Indications as a Territorial Development Strategy
AN  - 854554477; EJ913246
AB  - Geographical indications (GIs) are place-based names that convey the geographical origin, as well as the cultural and historical identity, of agricultural products. GIs are unique, in that they provide a means of ensuring that control over production and sales of a product stays within a local area, but at the same time they make use of extralocal markets. Although control over GIs largely rests with local actors, GIs are nested in wider regional, national, and international networks; and the passage from local to extralocal markets introduces new costs and benefits and new relations of power into the supply chain. The degree to which GI protection spurs development and protects local environmental and cultural resources depends on the structure of the GI legislation and on the territorial context in which protection is embedded.

T1  - Embedding Local Places in Global Spaces: Geographical Indications as a Territorial Development Strategy
AN  - 754037953; 201050987
AB  - Geographical indications (GIs) are place-based names that convey the geographical origin, as well as the cultural and historical identity, of agricultural products. GIs are unique, in that they provide a means of ensuring that control over production and sales of a product stays within a local area, but at the same time they make use of extralocal markets. Although control over GIs largely rests with local actors, GIs are nested in wider regional, national, and international networks; and the passage from local to extralocal markets introduces new costs and benefits and new relations of power into the supply chain. The degree to which GI protection spurs development and protects local environmental and cultural resources depends on the structure of the GI legislation and on the territorial context in which protection is embedded. Using a commodity-chains approach, I compare two GI production systems, tequila in Mexico and Comte cheese in France, in order to develop a theory of the factors that contribute to more sustainable, equitable GI production systems. I argue that three key differences in the design of the GI schemes help to explain the varying effects of the two cases: (1) the manner in which supply-chain actors define quality, (2) the way that the GI valorizes the terroir of the region, and (3) the strength and cohesion that the collective organizing body exhibits. Moreover, the institutional and political context in which GI supply chains 'touch down' plays a critical role. Contrary to a conceptualization of GIs as compatible with a purely market-oriented model, my comparison of these two cases indicates that some level of state involvement, in order to level the playing field and empower small farmers, is a necessary, although not sufficient, precondition for successful and sustainable GIs.

T1  - Reactions to the Market: Small Farmers in the Economic Reshaping of Nicaragua, Cuba, Russia, and China
AN  - 819182498
AB  - [Laura J. Enriquez] finds that there is nothing "inevitable" about the disappearance of the peasantry in the course of capitalist market expansion (as posited by Lenin and others) (204). Rather, even under the pressures of globalization, the matter of whether the peasant or small farmer economy prospered or dissolved was dependent on state policies, that is, the vision of agricultural development espoused by governments. In Russia and Nicaragua, the state led a full-scale "retreat" from socialism and failed to provide support for small-scale production while at the same time they opened up their markets to international competition in the name of increasing economic efficiency. Farmers who produced food for local markets were starved of credit; supportive programs and institutions were dismantled; and cheap food imports cut into their markets while, in the case of Nicaragua especially, a re-concentration of land in the hands of the few was favoured. (Food production did increase in Nicaragua in the course of the 1990s, but that was a consequence of the establishment of peace and security in the countryside at end of the contra war.) In Nicaragua, support was channeled to large agro-exporters, and in both Nicaragua and Russia, just about all efforts to sustain social equality were abandoned by governments that proceeded to dismantle cooperative and communal arrangements.

T1  - Participation in the world's first clean development mechanism forest project: the role of property rights, social capital and contractual rules
AN  - 753824964; 3991710
AB  - Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) forest projects are perceived as an attractive way to both help mitigate climate change and transfer income to rural poor. However, to engender participation of small-scale producers, a CDM forest project must offer sufficient incentives, while minimizing their costs of participation, all the while respecting the need for additionality. Property rights, social capital and contractual rules are critical in the success of CDM forest projects. In this paper, we ask what factors affect participation in the world's first CDM project, established in Guangxi Province, China. Using village-level surveys, we find that although the project facilitates participation through carbon pooling and a share-holding system, much of the project land remains unforested. We find that the primary reasons for the unforested regions are constrained contractual rules, property rights allocation disputes and low levels of social capital in some villages.

Sodhi              The biodiversity and climate consequences of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) expansion across South East Asia have received considerable attention. The human side of the issue, highlighted with reports of negative livelihood outcomes and rights abuses by oil palm companies, has also led to controversy. Oil palm related conflicts have been widely documented in Indonesia yet uptake by farmers has also been extensive. An assessment of the livelihood impacts of oil palm development, including sources of conflict, is needed to shed light on the apparent contradiction between these reports and the evident enthusiasm of farmers to join the oil palm craze thereby informing future expansion. We assessed the impact of oil palm development on the economic wellbeing of rural farmers in Indonesia. We found that many smallholders have benefited substantially from the higher returns to land and labour afforded by oil palm but district authorities and smallholder cooperatives play key roles in the realisation of benefits. Conflicts between communities and companies have resulted almost entirely from lack of transparency, the absence of free, prior, and informed consent and unequal benefit sharing, and have been exacerbated by the absence of clear land rights. We make specific recommendations to improve the present situation and foster the establishment of smallholder friendly production regimes. Oil palm expansion in Indonesia is set to continue. If environmental standards can be raised and policy interventions targeted at the broader social impacts of land development this expansion may be achieved to the significant benefit of large numbers of rural smallholders.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Improving the efficiency of domestic vegetable marketing systems in East Africa: constraints and opportunities
AN  - 761030603; 4119245
AB  - The majority of smallholders growing vegetables in East Africa market their produce domestically. It is an important source of income for many poor smallholder households and those involved in vegetable value chains. This paper highlights the major constraints of and identifies potential opportunities for improving the efficiency of domestic vegetable marketing systems in two countries - Kenya and Tanzania. Emphasis is given to tomato and onion as commonly marketed and consumed vegetables throughout the region. The authors also look at indigenous vegetables marketed domestically. Finally, they consider the importance of the export vegetable subsector as a role model for improving the efficiency, growth and economic value of domestic vegetable marketing systems in East Africa. This analysis should guide policy makers towards key interventions to facilitate the development of efficient vegetable marketing systems, contributing to poverty reduction and fostering economic growth in East Africa.

T1  - Adding value improves livelihoods
AN  - 1325052287
AB  - Post-production technologies or adding value to crops is now a key strategy of the Sasakawa Africa Association (SAA). They are establishing facilities for demonstrating the economic viability of these processes to improve smallholder commercial competitiveness and livelihoods. The new SAA strategy is being scaled in the four focus countries: Ethiopia, Mali, Uganda and Nigeria. The agroprocessing sub-sector has expanded rapidly in these countries in the last few years and is now playing a crucial economic role in most African nations. In response, SAA in Ethiopia recently asked the Nippon Skilled Volunteer Association, a Japanese NGO, to send a bread-making expert to improve the bread-making skills of the technical staff who would then organize technical training for local bakeries. The increasing enthusiasm of women's groups for the agroprocessing sector was demonstrated recently at Becho, in Ethiopia, where Amina Mohammed, a local home agent, persuaded a women's group to start a local agroprocessing business to generate income.

T1  - Biofuels, poverty, and growth: a computable general equilibrium analysis of Mozambique
AN  - 215500291
AB  - This paper assesses the implications of large-scale investments in biofuels for growth and income distribution. We find that biofuels investment enhances growth and poverty reduction despite some displacement of food crops by biofuels. Overall, the biofuel investment trajectory analyzed increases Mozambique's annual economic growth by 0.6 percentage points and reduces the incidence of poverty by about 6 percentage points over a 12-year phase-in period. Benefits depend on production technology. An outgrower approach to producing biofuels is more pro-poor, due to the greater use of unskilled labor and accrual of land rents to smallholders, compared with the more capital-intensive plantation approach. Moreover, the benefits of outgrower schemes are enhanced if they result in technology spillovers to other crops. These results should not be taken as a green light for unrestrained biofuels development. Rather, they indicate that a carefully designed and managed biofuels policy holds the potential for substantial gains. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

TT  - Conflicto social alrededor de la conservacion en la reserva de la biosfera de los tuxtlas: Un analisis de intereses, posturas y consecuencias
AN  - 887497200; 201118372
AB  - This article analyzes the social conflict that arose as a result of the expropriation of small-farmer ejido lands to consolidate one of the core zones of the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve in the southern part of the state of Veracruz, Mexico. As a case study, it considers the experience of two ejido communities whose territories lie wholly and partially within the expropriated area: Peninsula de Moreno and Miguel Hidalgo, respectively. The conflict's social and environmental effects are evaluated through a discussion of the socio-political context and stakeholder perspectives, interests and positions. It is argued that in the context of conservation programs, non-consented actions not only fail to ameliorate environmental degradation but may actually worsen it. On the one hand, these actions weaken the social fabric necessary to propel a process of sustainable community development, and on the other, conservation becomes an illegitimate activity or interest for local populations, thereby hardening stakeholder positions and complicating a cooperative search for solutions.

TT  - Problemas De La Regulacion En Semillas. El Caso Del Algodon Transgenico En El Chaco
AN  - 887496889; 2011-104710
AB  - This paper discusses the regulation on transgenic cotton in perspective of actual practices and needs of small farmers in Chaco Province, Argentina. The aim is to disentangle the extent to which the existing regulation take account of all farmers' practices and whether existing regulation, as it is designed and implemented has had any effect on improving the livelihood of poor cotton farmers. Based on fieldwork done in Chaco in June 2008, we claim that the regulatory designs neglected to take into account small farmers' traditional long-standing practices regarding relations within the value chain. As a consequence, poor farmer's real seed trade occurs beyond The Seed Law. On the one hand, this implies that these farmers do not pay royalties on IPR. But on the other hand it also implies they have no protection over the quality of seeds they buy. Moreover, in formality also creates risks at national level because it introduces further weakness in the ways in which ecological risks can be managed, and potentially threatens continued access to international markets. The paper put forward guidelines for policy action. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Problems of regulation of seeds: the case of transgenic cotton in Chaco
TT  - Problemas de la regulación en semillas. El caso del algodón transgénico en el Chaco
AN  - 861386246; 4180221
AB  - ABSTRACT IN SPANISH: Este artículo discute las regulaciones sobre algodón transgénico desde el punto de vista de las prácticas y las necesidades de los agricultores de menor tamaño de la provincia de Chaco, Argentina. El objetivo es esclarecer el alcance que tienen las regulaciones existentes sobre las realidades de los distintos tipos de agricultores, y revisar si dicha regulación, tal como ha sido diseñada e implementada, ha contribuido a mejorar las condiciones de vida y producción de los agricultores de algodón más desfavorecidos. A partir de los resultados recogidos en un trabajo de campo realizado en Chaco en junio de 2008, el presente estudio sostiene que el diseño de las regulaciones existentes no ha tenido en cuenta las características de las prácticas usuales de los agricultores más pequeños en relación a su posición en la cadena de valor. En consecuencia, en los hechos, el comercio de semillas termina realizándose informalmente, por fuera de la Ley Nacional de Semillas. Por un lado, ello implica que estos agricultores no pagan regalías por derechos de propiedad intelectual. Pero, por otro lado, también implica que pierden toda protección legal sobre la calidad de las semillas que compran. Más aún, la informalidad también crea riesgos a nivel nacional porque debilita los mecanismos por los cuales los riesgos ecológicos pueden ser manejados, amenazando además el potencial acceso a mercados internacionales. Este artículo sugiere recomendaciones de políticas tendientes a mejorar el diseño regulatorio y su impacto sobre las condiciones de vida de los agricultores de algodón más desfavorecidos.    // ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: This paper discusses the regulation of transgenic cotton from the perspective of the actual practices and needs of small farmers in Chaco Province, Argentina. The aim is to disentangle the extent to which the existing regulations take account of all farmers' practices and whether existing regulation, as it is designed and implemented has had any effect on improving the livelihood of poor cotton farmers. Based on fieldwork done in Chaco in June 2008, we claim that the regulatory designs neglected to take into account small farmers' traditional long-standing practices regarding relations within the value chain. As a consequence, poor farmers' real seed trade occurs beyond The Seed Law. On the one hand, this implies that these farmers do not pay royalties on IPR. But on the other hand, it also implies they have no protection over the quality of seeds they buy. Moreover, informality also creates risks at national level because it introduces further weakness in the ways in which ecological risks can be managed, and potentially threatens continued access to international markets. The paper puts forward guidelines for policy action.

T1  - Fair trade rooibos tea: connecting South African producers and American consumer markets
AN  - 37250202; 3922503
AB  - This article analyzes the recent growth and configuration of Fair Trade networks connecting South African Rooibos tea producers with American consumer markets. As we demonstrate, Fair Trade's growth in the Rooibos sector engages key issues of black empowerment, land reform, and sustainable development in post-Apartheid South Africa. Fair Trade networks provide small-scale black Rooibos producers with critical markets. Most significantly, the Wupperthal and Heiveld cooperatives have upgraded into processing and packaging and their jointly owned Fairpackers facility now exports shelf-ready Rooibos tea. Analyzing the nature of US Fair Trade Rooibos buyers and their South African sourcing arrangements, we identify key variations in Fair Trade commitment and engagement between mission-driven and market-driven distributors. While mission-driven buyers engage small-scale Rooibos cooperatives in multifaceted partnership networks, market-driven buyers pursue conventional sourcing strategies favoring purchases from large plantations and exporters. We conclude that tensions between a radical and commercial orientation toward Fair Trade in Rooibos tea networks in many ways mirror those in the broader movement. All rights reserved, Elsevier

T1  - Livestock revolution and its impacts on the sustainability of marginal and small farmers in India: a case study
AN  - 1024213229; 4311585
AB  - Livestock husbandry is an important segment of Indian agriculture. Its share of contribution to agricultural gross products has increased since the implementation of the globalization of agricultural trade. Livestock revolution has occurred not only in India, but in all tropical developing countries, owing to recently increasing demand for animal-derived products in national and international markets. We selected Aligarh, a micro geographical unit from the Upper Ganga plain of Uttar Pradesh for this study. 600 households from 12 villages in the area were surveyed for collection of data. The study revealed that the region witnessed growth in livestock husbandry with selected species during 1993-1994 to 2003-2004. Buffalo and goats showed a positive change due to enhancement in the demand of milk and meat on account of increasing urban consumers, liberalization of agri-business and the changing of food habits over the decades. Cattle numbers have contracted owing to the mechanization of agriculture and the prohibition of cow slaughter in the country. Two thirds of livestock keepers, workers and beneficiaries are poor farmers with less than 3 hectares of land holding. The majority of them follow the livestock-cropping integrated farming system, which is highly beneficial rather than rearing livestock exclusively. Livestock husbandry is an economically viable, socially acceptable and environmentally sustainable farming system in the study area of the Aligarh district.

T1  - Adding value to cassava
AN  - 199977189
AB  - In many developing countries smallholder farmers work hard to produce crops, only to find problems in marketing the surplus. To help farmers, Government and NGOs often set up programs that sells products through 'value chains' -- the various steps that produce takes from farmer to consumer. The aim of a value chain approach is to distribute benefits to all levels of the chain, so that farmers are able to participate in a fair system to improve their livelihoods. Cassava has significant potential in Malawi, especially as erratic rainfall and high input costs are affecting maize production. It is hoped that a large, reliable, supply of cassava will cause potential buyers in Malawi -- ranging from major manufacturers to bakeries -- to start buying locally and reduce their purchases from other countries. By securing a demand for cassava and strengthening the overall market for cassava, it is hoped that increasing numbers of farmers may begin to produce and profit from cassava.

T1  - The influence of contracts on smallholder pepper (Piper nigrum L.) producers in Costa Rica under different market conditions
AN  - 908630453
AB  - Introduction. Costa Rica's pepper production (Piper nigrum L.) is relatively low, but for the farmers involved it presents an interesting cash cropping activity. This paper aims to analyse whether contracts with processing firms offer an incentive for farmers to invest in pepper production and thereby increase their income. We analysed the characteristics of farmers with formal and informal contracts to see if this influences their way of producing pepper, their yields and income. The second goal of our work was to study whether market conditions (one or more buyers) influence contract uptake and pepper production. Materials and methods. A survey was conducted in 2000 among 63 farmers, 32 of whom had access to only one buyer and 31 of whom could sell to three potential purchasers. Characteristics of farmers, farms and pepper production were compared in terms of market conditions and forms of contract. A subsample of 24 farmers was revisited in 2008. Results. Overall, the effects of contracts in terms of improving access to inputs and increasing yield and productivity were limited. However, formal contracts were endorsed by income-constrained farmers, especially in the early phase of establishing themselves in the market. In subsequent phases, and under more competitive market conditions, producers seemed to prefer verbal commitments to formal contracts. In situations where a monopsony situation prevailed, there were lower yields. Conclusion. Contracts are important in the start-up phase, and competitive market conditions favour a process of moderate intensification which stimulates high returns at relatively low costs to the most established pepper producers.

T1  - Global Retail Chains and Poor Farmers: Evidence from Madagascar
AN  - 60299645; 200948130
AB  - Global retail companies ('supermarkets') have an increasing influence on developing countries, through foreign investments and/or through the imposition of their private standards. The impact on developing countries and poverty is often assessed as negative. In this paper we show the opposite, based on an analysis of primary data collected to measure the impact of supermarkets on small contract farmers in Madagascar, one of the poorest countries in the world. Almost 10,000 farmers in the Highlands of Madagascar produce vegetables for supermarkets in Europe. In this global supply chain, small farmers' micro-contracts are combined with intensive farm assistance and supervision programs to fulfill complex quality requirements and phyto-sanitary standards of supermarkets. Small farmers that participate in these contracts have higher welfare, more income stability and shorter lean periods. We also find significant effects on improved technology adoption, better resource management and spillovers on the productivity of the staple crop rice. The small but emerging modern retail sector in Madagascar does not (yet) deliver these benefits as they do not (yet) request the same high standards for their supplies. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Impact of contract farming on income: linking small farmers, packers, and supermarkets in China
AN  - 37225398; 3909647
AB  - This study compares contract and non-contract growers of apples and green onions in Shandong Province, China in order to explore the constraints on participation and the impact of contract farming on income. We find little evidence that firms prefer to work with larger farms, though all farms in the area are quite small. Using a Heckman selection-correction model, we find that contract farming raises income even after controlling for observable and unobservable household characteristics. These results suggest that contract farming can help raise small-farm income, though questions remain regarding the number of farmers that can be brought into such schemes.

T1  - Global retail chains and poor farmers: evidence from Madagascar
AN  - 37224689; 3909643
AB  - Global retail companies ('supermarkets') have an increasing influence on developing countries, through foreign investments and/or through the imposition of their private standards. The impact on developing countries and poverty is often assessed as negative. In this paper we show the opposite, based on an analysis of primary data collected to measure the impact of supermarkets on small contract farmers in Madagascar, one of the poorest countries in the world. Almost 10,000 farmers in the Highlands of Madagascar produce vegetables for supermarkets in Europe. In this global supply chain, small farmers' micro-contracts are combined with intensive farm assistance and supervision programs to fulfill complex quality requirements and phyto-sanitary standards of supermarkets. Small farmers that participate in these contracts have higher welfare, more income stability and shorter lean periods. We also find significant effects on improved technology adoption, better resource management and spillovers on the productivity of the staple crop rice. The small but emerging modern retail sector in Madagascar does not (yet) deliver these benefits as they do not (yet) request the same high standards for their supplies. All rights reserved, Elsevier

T1  - From Plantations to Smallholder Production: The Role of Policy in the Reorganization of the Sri Lankan Tea Sector
AN  - 229654986
AB  - The Sri Lankan tea sector has changed from one dominated by vertically integrated plantations to one where independent processors of black tea purchase their input (green leaf tea) from small, independent growers. This paper provides a unifying conceptual framework to characterize three major factors affecting the changes in vertical coordination arrangements (transaction, production, and management costs). Regulation and government policy have altered these determinants of organizational change. Transaction costs have been reduced by state intervention into the price for green leaf which subsequently lowered the risk of processors re-negotiating prices downward. Production costs, which continue to be dominated by labor expenses due to the lack of technological developments for harvesting, have increased more for plantations than independent producers due to union pressures.

T1  - Does fair trade deliver on its core value proposition? Effects on income, educational attainment, and health in three countries
AN  - 883434411; 2009-23069-004
AB  - Alternative trade organizations (ATOs) based on philosophies of social justice and/or environmental well-being are establishing new channels of trade and marketing. Partisans promote ATOs as systems to transfer benefits from consumers in the wealthy northern hemisphere to producers in the poor southern hemisphere. The central public policy question is whether the well-being of poor agricultural producers in the southern hemisphere is actually being improved by fair-trade practices, or are consumers who buy products on this premise deceived? The research reported here partially answers the question whether participation in a fair-trade coffee marketing channel delivers benefits to small-scale producers in Latin America. The authors employ a survey methodology to compare TransFair USA (TF) cooperative participants and nonparticipating farmers in three countries on socioeconomic indicators of well-being. According to the analysis, the economic effects of fair-trade participation are unassailable; the effects on educational and health outcomes are uneven. However, TF cooperative participation positively affects educational attainment and the likelihood that a child is currently studying. The authors find positive health-related consequences of TF cooperative participation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Is there a pilot in the chain? Identifying the key drivers of change in the fresh pineapple sector
AN  - 872586687
AB  - High-value export-oriented agriculture is today considered as a means of integrating smallholders into the world economy. This paper examines the geographic and organisational changes that have taken place in the fresh pineapple sector over the past 50 years. We begin with a historical analysis of the changes in leadership among producer countries, namely the dethroning of Cote d'Ivoire by Costa Rica. We show that this geographical shift has been accompanied by massive organisational changes: the pineapple sector is increasingly driven by large downstream actors who derive their power from the ability to impose their definition of quality to the whole chain, and from economies of scale and scope. Although varietal innovation plays a key role throughout the period, commercial and logistical innovation are of increasing strategic importance. However, because of the constraints imposed by the concerned supply chains, small farmers risk being excluded or marginalized. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Governance of Fair Trade System: Evidence from Small Honey Producers in Rio Grande do Sul
AN  - 1448424599
AB  - This paper discusses Fair Trade [FT] certification as a way to include small producers in global value chains, and identifies the main barriers for small honey producers from RS to meet these criteria. A new trading system such as FT has been providing access for food products coming from small farmers from developing countries. The method of this study integrates global value chain analysis and the methodology proposed by Paul (2005) to analyse FT as development projects. This study is three-fold: first to characterise the FT system; then to present the role of governance by third party certifiers such as FLO-CERT and finally to provide empirical evidence of the main difficulties that small producers have to comply with FT, such as export and organisation capacity. Our findings show that large retailers recently became big players in the FT system. The certification costs are high but can provide market access though there is a risk of overspecialisation.

T1  - Small scale farmers sell rice to World Food Programme
AN  - 199972338
AB  - The World Food Programme (WFP) has for the first time bought food from small scale farmers in Kenya, acquiring food for drought-hit Kenyans elsewhere in the country while at the same time encouraging small farmers to think more about markets. The 40-ton sale of rice was made by a cooperative of rice farmers in Ahero in Western Kenya, as part of the Purchase for Progress (P4P) project. P4P is a groundbreaking project through which WFP hopes to encourage low-income farmers to grow more by buying their surplus crops. This year, farmers in Ahero have managed to grow almost double what they normally would have been able to, thanks to an irrigation scheme that had been rehabilitated by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.

T1  - Dynamics and resource use efficiency of agricultural land sales and rental market in India
AN  - 58800056; 2008-259731
AB  - In a populous developing country such as India, developmental interventions are often woven around land, as this is the most critical resource in the livelihood support system of rural communities. In such a socio-economic environment, land has multiple uses. It is the most important source of income, a symbol of social status and prestige, and has very high collateral value for resource poor farm families. In these countries, the migration of rural workers to urban centers in search of employment, coupled with universal individual inheritance characteristics of land ownership, perpetuates the fragmentation of land holdings. In the majority of such cases, the point has been reached where land has become uneconomic and non-viable for cultivation. For farmers left with uneconomic land holdings there are only three options available; sell the land, rent it out, or lease land from others. In such scenarios land lease and land market policies assumes critical importance. India has one of the most restrictive and unorganized land sales and rental markets in the world. Such restrictive land sales policy can be traced to the historical socio-economic realities of the country. Historically, distress land sales have been very common. Under the restrictive poor land marketing environment of India, transaction costs for buying land are very high. Government imposed land sales taxes such as stamp duties which have to be paid upon registration of a transaction, further increase the total cost of land sales. Analysis of state level data on rental restrictions in India along with a nationally representative survey, indicate that rental restrictions negatively affect productivity and equity. Land rental restrictions reduce the scope for efficiency-enhancing rental transactions that benefit poor producers. This study attempts to identify drivers of the land market in India and compares level of resource productivity under different land lease arrangements. Such a study may offer valuable input to land policy planners in the formulation of land sales and land lease policies for agricultural land. The results of the study have important policy implications as the study suggests that there is little justification for restricting the functioning of land markets. The dominance of marginal and small farmers in land sales highlights the economic non-viability of marginal holdings. The prevalence of tenancy among various types of farmers suggests the need to grant legally recognized status to tenancy. This may protect the interest of both the lessor and lessee. Corporate farming/contract farming will need to be justified based on both economic and social considerations such as the cost of contract enforcement to marginal and small farmers after they enter into contract with the corporate sector. Results also indicate that while various short-term land lease arrangements have different production efficiency levels, differences in productivities across the land lease arrangements are relatively small. As such, it is difficult to view lower input use as a consequence of land lease arrangements. However findings do suggest that various short-term land lease contracts are relatively less productive than owner cultivated land. Decomposition of the factor intensity levels in the study identified chemical and seed inputs as the major source of differences. In conclusion, short-term land lease patterns do not constrain productivity at the current level of development in the Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh and there is little justification for restricting the functioning of land markets.

T1  - The Fair Tracing project: mapping a traceable value chain for Indian coffee
AN  - 58824050; 2008-394287
AB  - This research note describes the second stage of 'Fair Tracing', a research project funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of the United Kingdom. The project aims to support ethical trade by implementing digital tracing technologies in value chains to provide consumers and producers with enhanced information about specific products; in this case, Chilean wine and Indian coffee. The genesis and first stage of the project - as it relates to the India case study - was documented in an earlier research note published in Contemporary South Asia one year ago. This note goes on to describe the second stage of this case study, which begins by mapping the life of the coffee bean in its current global commodity chain, and ends with proposing a traceable value chain for small growers of Indian coffee. It is argued that the use of tracking technologies will help increase the value chain 'rents' that accrue to farmers in developing countries by allowing them to charge more for differentiated products increasingly demanded by informed consumers, both in the West and in home markets.

T1  - Private intergenerational transfers in the rural Brazilian Amazon region
TT  - Transferências intergeracionais privadas na Amazônia rural brasileira
AN  - 759519828; 4111591
AB  - What motivates family members to share resources? Past research argues for, on the one hand, love and altruism, and on the other, the expectations of reciprocity. Drawing on this literature, this paper examines intergenerational transfers between small farmers and their non-coresident children in the rural area around the city of Altamira, Pará, Brazil. We apply GoM (Grade of Membership) models to create profiles of private transfers, using data collected in 2005 by a team from Indiana University. The results show three profiles: low intergenerational transfers, high levels of transfers of visits and help, and high levels of transfers of visits and money. There is no clear difference in profile by birth order, but we do find sex differences in profile: men are more likely to send money while women provide time transfers (work and visits). Upward transfers are most common from children with high levels of education or living in urban areas, suggesting a repayment of prior investments made by parents. Thus, our empirical evidence supports theories arguing that transfers are motivated by intertemporal contracts between parents and children, and that altruistic theories of family transfers should be rethought among rural agricultural populations in contexts characterized by many environmental and institutional challenges.

Amor, benevolência e altruísmo, por um lado,    e interesse na reciprocidade, por outro, são as duas principais respostas    que têm sido dadas pela literatura a essa pergunta. Este trabalho trata    das transferências intergeracionais privadas que ocorrem entre pais e    filhos residentes fora do domicílio parental de pequenos agricultores    na área rural de Altamira, no Estado do Pará. Utilizamos dados    primários coletados em 2005 por uma equipe da Universidade de Indiana    e aplicamos a técnica Grade of Membership de modo a delinear perfis    de transferências privadas. Os resultados sugerem três perfis distintos:    o de baixo envolvimento nas transferências intergeracionais, o de alto    envolvimento nas trocas através de visitas e ajuda com trabalho e o de    alto envolvimento nas trocas com visitas e dinheiro. Não há evidências    de preferências por ordem de parturição, embora tenhamos    encontrado uma especialização sexual das trocas: homens enviam    dinheiro, ao passo que mulheres proveem trabalho e visitas. As transferências    monetárias ascendentes são particularmente importantes entre filhos    com alta escolaridade e residentes em áreas urbanas, o que indica arranjos    informais de repagamento a investimentos parentais feitos no passado. Tais evidências    empíricas corroboram as teorias de reciprocidade e investimento parental    e sugerem que as teorias altruístas tradicionais devem ser repensadas    em contextos de restrição imposta pelos desafios ambientais e    institucionais que envolvem as famílias de pequenos agricultores rurais    em países em desenvolvimento.

T1  - UTTARAKHAND STATE COOPERATIVE FEDERATION: CAN IT HELP THE HORTICULTURE FARMERS?
AN  - 202669032
AB  - The primary producers of horticultural crops face numerous problems in marketing their high value produce to the urban markets. In the process they not only loose profit margins on their output but also become victims of intermediaries who garner the major chuck of income from sale of high value horticultural crops. This Case presents such a decision situation encountered by the apex management of a cooperative federation which has the mandate to turnaround the poorly performing horticulture sector and deliver adequate benefits to farmers of the state. This Case highlights the problems faced by a typical Indian farmer in marketing his produce. Small holdings, low productivity, lack of credit, poor infrastructure etc hinder these farmers in moving up the value chain. The stated objective of Uttarakhand State Cooperative Federation is to support cooperative activities for sustainable development of farmers in the state. However, it is involved in various activities right from running a drug factory to selling insurance products to providing credit etc.

T1  - One Decade of Drought and Two of Neoliberal Reforms in the Sierra Sonorense: Responses by the Rural Poor
AN  - 61753413; 200928153
AB  - Since the mid-1990s, Northwest Mexico has been experiencing drought conditions. As Mexico's number one irrigator, the state of Sonora's agricultural sector is particularly concerned about the availability and distribution of surface and ground water. Drought has contributed to a sharp decline in cultivated area, the abandonment of land, and permanent out migration of a large sector of the rural population. This paper examines the vulnerability to drought of small farmers in the Santa Cruz and Magadalena basins, south of the Sonora-Arizona international border. Farmer's ability to respond to drought is considered within the larger context of neoliberal reform policies, social inequality, and free trade between Mexico and the U.S. By focusing on the most vulnerable, the paper argues that informal social networks and collective organization are key strategies to improve adaptive capacity, particularly for those who do not have access to state sponsored adaptations.

T1  - Trade, Standards, and Poverty: Evidence from Senegal
AN  - 61699754; 200907855
AB  - In the debate on trade and poverty it is argued that standards act as trade barriers and cause marginalization of the poor. This paper quantifies income and poverty effects of high-standards trade and integrates labor market effects, by using company and household survey data from the vegetable export chain in Senegal. We find that exports grew sharply despite increasing standards, contributing importantly to rural incomes and poverty reduction. Tightening standards induced a shift from smallholder contract farming to integrated estate production, altering the mechanism through which poor households benefit: through labor markets instead of product markets.

T1  - Weather-risk hedging by farmers: An empirical study of willingness-to-pay in Rajasthan, India
AN  - 236636418
AB  - Small farmers in developing countries have very little means of managing the weather-risk to their agricultural produce. Weather derivatives could provide a solution, but the demand for such instruments and the willingness to invest in them needs to be researched. The purpose of this paper is to assess weather-risk hedging by farmers, focusing on the willingness to pay in Rajasthan, India. The paper presents results of a contingent valuation study done on the findings of a survey carried out in six villages in the state of Rajasthan. The survey was done on over 500 farmers after explaining the concept of weather derivatives and how they would work to help them hedge their weather-related yield risk. The survey included questions on factors, which could have a bearing on the farmers' willingness to pay, and a bidding game where responses were solicited to premiums in a hypothetical market. Probit and logit models are used to determine probabilities of Yes responses to various bids and the mean willingness-to-pay. The paper brings out a model, which uses nine independent variables affecting the probability of a farmer saying Yes to a price quoted to him for a weather derivative. Using the results from the probit and logit models, the farmers' mean willingness-to-pay is determined to be around 8.8% of the maximum possible payout of a weather derivative contract. With weather derivatives being accepted as a means of risk management for agriculture in developing countries, the willingness-to-pay figures determined in this paper would provide an insight to the structuring and pricing of weather derivatives, especially in developing countries.

T1  - ONE DECADE OF DROUGHT AND TWO OF NEOLIBERAL REFORMS IN THE SIERRA SONORENSE: RESPONSES BY THE RURAL POOR*
AN  - 213122123
AB  - Since the mid-1990s, Northwest Mexico has been experiencing drought conditions. As Mexico's number one irrigator, the state of Sonora's agricultural sector is particularly concerned about the availability and distribution of surface and ground water. Drought has contributed to a sharp decline in cultivated area, the abandonment of land, and permanent out migration of a large sector of the rural population. This paper examines the vulnerability to drought of small farmers in the Santa Cruz and Magadalena basins, south of the Sonora-Arizona international border. Farmer's ability to respond to drought is considered within the larger context of neoliberal reform policies, social inequality, and free trade between Mexico and the U.S. By focusing on the most vulnerable, the paper argues that informal social networks and collective organization are key strategies to improve adaptive capacity, particularly for those who do not have access to state sponsored adaptations.

T1  - Gambling on Pakistan's Agricultural Future
AN  - 61707982; 200907875
AB  - Najma Sadeque argues that the future of Pakistan's agriculture could go in two possible directions - working the soil to death chasing export monoculture and thereby hastening desertification and the collapse of the farm sector and the economy at large, or returning to intensive, small-scale and collective organic faming. If it chooses the latter path, the process of rediscovering traditional farming methods would create space for small farmers to help bring about a degree of egalitarianism and true free enterprise - reluctantly on the part of the power-holders, but permitted out of sheer need rather than for any ideological reasons.

AB  - ABSTRACT IN SPANISH: Los teoristas de la globalización han demonstrado como los proyectos destinados a profundizar la integración trasnacional económica y política, pueden producir nuevas formas de riesgo y vulnerabilidad. Los desastres - naturales o no - sirven como encrucijadas, por medio de las que se revelan varios enlaces: entre las estructuras de poder locales y globales, entre la cultura ideológica y material, entre las sociedades humanas y los ambientes naturales. Este artículo investiga como los efectos sinergisticos de la integración económica norteamericana, la privatización y corporatización de la agricultura mexicana, los mercados internacionales del maíz inestables, y el cambio climático global, se experimentan como un "desastre gubernamental" en las vidas de los campesinos del estado de Hidalgo, México. El presente estudio analiza como una consciencia particular acerca de la catástrofe es producida y comunicada por medio de un disurso de la desecación, el cual se basa en ideas tradicionales sobre la explotación y la vulnerabilidad. Vivir el desastre como una exclusión permanente de las formas politicas colectivas, sirve para reforzar y respaldar a los proyectos de neoliberalización que funcionan para individualizar las practíces de ciudadanía en el campo mexicano. // ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: Globalization theorists have demonstrated how projects aimed at deepening transnational economic and political integration produce new forms of risk and vulnerability. Disasters-natural and otherwise-serve as critical nodes through which a variety of links are revealed: between local and global power structures, ideological and material culture, and human societies, and natural environments. This article examines how the synergistic effects of North American economic integration, the privatization and corporatization of Mexican agriculture, volatile international maize markets, and global climate change are experienced as a 'governmental disaster' by campesinos [small farmers] in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico. It analyzes how a particular consciousness of catastrophe is produced and articulated via a discourse of desiccation, which indexes traditional notions concerning exploitation and vulnerability. The experience of disaster as a foreclosure of collective forms of political agency serves to reinforce neoliberalizing projects that work to individuate practices of citizenship in the Mexican countryside.

T1  - Success in High Value Horticultural Export Markets for the Small Farmers: The Case of Mahagrapes in India
AN  - 61702622; 200904754
AB  - In spite of being the second largest horticultural producer in the world, India is a failed exporter mainly because of the inability to meet the food safety standards. Hence, successes in horticultural exports are rare. Here, we study one unique success story, Mahagrapes, a marketing partner to farmer cooperatives attributing its success to a combination of collective action and public private partnerships. Our results indicate that Mahagrapes farmers earn significantly higher income vis-a-vis their outside marketing option and smallholders face no bias in selection. Together with the farmer's ability to consistently meet standards, this implies that the model can be scaled up. [Copyright 2008 Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Farmers, markets and contracts: chain integration of smallholder producers in Costa Rica
AN  - 37146902; 3864690
AB  - ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: Contract farming is frequently considered as an appropriate mechanism for integrating smallholders into dynamic markets. We discuss the rationale for the variety in contractual arrangements between small-scale producers and agro-processing firms in the Northern and Central region of Costa Rica. Different market configurations give rise to delivery conditions, ranging from spot market negotiations to verbal or written contracts. We analyse which types of farmers are typically engaged in each of these contractual arrangements, and what are the implications for their production and investment decisions. Main attention is given to the effects of institutional organization for equity, efficiency and sustainability. The analysis is based on detailed case studies for two non-traditional commodities (pepper and chayote). Results suggest that contracts provide an important insurance device for farmers meeting investment and information constraints, and offer incentive for more intensive input use. This suggests that contract farming may be a critical requirement enabling smallholders to enter into specialized markets.    // ABSTRACT IN SPANISH: Frecuentemente se considera a la agricultura de contrato como un mecanismo apropiado para fomentar la integración campesina en mercados dinámicos. Discutimos los fundamentos que explican la gran variedad en arreglos contractuales entre pequeños productores y empresas agro-industriales en la zona Norte y Central de Costa Rica. Diferentes configuraciones mercantiles inducen condiciones de suministro que varían entre negociaciones en el mercado mismo hasta contratos verbales y escritos. Aquí analizamos qué tipo de productores se relacionan normalmente en cada uno de estos arreglos contractuales, y cuáles son las implicaciones para sus decisiones de producción e inversión. Prestamos especial atención a los efectos de la organización institucional para la equidad, la eficiencia y la sostenibilidad. El análisis está basado en estudios de caso de dos rubros no-tradicionales (pimienta y chayote). Los resultados indican que los contractos ofrecen una importante opción de seguro para productores con limitaciones de inversión e información, y generan incentivos para intensificar el uso de insumos. Eso implica que la agricultura de contrato puede ser un requerimiento vital para facilitar la integración campesina en mercados especializados. Reprinted by permission of CEDLA Edita, Amsterdam

T1  - Farmers, Markets and Contracts: Chain Integration of Smallholder Producers in Costa Rica
AN  - 208897516
AB  - [...]the envisaged rapid integration of different types of farmers into the agro-export sector did not work out as expected and high transaction costs and other market failures particularly affected the least-prepared producers.

[...]given their restricted bargaining power and limited exit options, such farmers are considered an attractive party to enter into a contract with a trader or processing firm (Key and Runsten 1999).

[...]the comparison of different market situations indicates that a local monopsony might generate incentives for realizing fixed investments in nontraditional crop plantations.

Even when most producers are aware of the usage restrictions for chemicals on produce oriented towards the export market, rejection of full containers still frequently occurs.

Since producers can easily sell substandard produce on the domestic market, chemical residues represent a serious public health risk.

T1  - Global Private Regulation and Value-Chain Restructuring in Indonesian Smallholder Coffee Systems
AN  - 61668113; 200833836
AB  - Consumer concerns over the environmental and social conditions of coffee production have led to the proliferation of sustainability codes, certification schemes, and labeling claims in the sector. This paper addresses how the global private regulation of ethical and environmental standards is having several implications for value chain structures and institutions in the smallholder coffee systems of Indonesia. Global private regulation is driving structural changes in modes of farmer organization, trader-farmer relationships, and is resulting in the increased upstream penetration of multinational trading companies into coffee-producing areas across Indonesia. An unintended consequence of these change; in the future may be to increase transaction costs along the value chain and to exert an overall downward pressure on farm-gate prices.

T1  - From smallholders to transnationals: The impact of changing consumer preferences in the EU on Ghana's pineapple sector
AN  - 58803415; 2008-230568
AB  - This paper explores the impact that a new type of pineapple, and subsequent changing consumer preferences in the Global North, has had on the livelihoods of pineapple growers in Ghana. The paper starts by tracing how research and development in Costa Rica by the world's largest producers of pineapple, Del Monte and Dole, have resulted in a new variety MD2. This new pineapple type has been marketed in the EU through campaigns carried out by plantation companies via supermarkets. Consumer preferences have subsequently switched to MD2 away from the varieties which previously dominated the market, including the Ghanaian grown Smooth Cayenne.

T1  - From smallholders to transnationals: the impact of changing consumer preferences in the EU on Ghana's pineapple sector
AN  - 37021142; 3803096
AB  - This paper explores the impact that a new type of pineapple, and subsequent changing consumer preferences in the Global North, has had on the livelihoods of pineapple growers in Ghana. The paper starts by tracing how research and development in Costa Rica by the world's largest producers of pineapple, Del Monte and Dole, have resulted in a new variety MD2. This new pineapple type has been marketed in the EU through campaigns carried out by plantation companies via supermarkets. Consumer preferences have subsequently switched to MD2 away from the varieties which previously dominated the market, including the Ghanaian grown Smooth Cayenne. Ghanaian smallholders have experienced a dramatic drop in the demand for Smooth Cayenne and are unable to switch to growing MD2. The Ghanaian pineapple sector is consequently being restructured with large-scale pineapple farms, principally run by transnational companies, growing large quantities of MD2 for export. Through a detailed empirical study of the changing livelihoods of pineapple growers in two settlements in Ghana, we show how smallholders have been affected in differing ways as transnational companies have increasingly entered the market. Recent attempts to incorporate smallholders as producers of niche pineapple products are discussed.

T1  - Global private regulation and value-chain restructuring in Indonesian smallholder coffee systems
AN  - 36991596; 3783916
AB  - Consumer concerns over the environmental and social conditions of coffee production have led to the proliferation of sustainability codes, certification schemes, and labeling claims in the sector. This paper addresses how the global private regulation of ethical and environmental standards is having several implications for value chain structures and institutions in the smallholder coffee systems of Indonesia. Global private regulation is driving structural changes in modes of farmer organization, trader-farmer relationships, and is resulting in the increased upstream penetration of multinational trading companies into coffee-producing areas across Indonesia. An unintended consequence of these changes in the future may be to increase transaction costs along the value chain and to exert an overall downward pressure on farm-gate prices.

T1  - Context and contingency: the coffee crisis for conventional small-scale coffee farmers in Brazil
AN  - 231473981
AB  - Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America and the world's leading producer and exporter of coffee. Smallholders are the predominant producers of Brazilian coffee and have been significantly impacted by post-ISI (import substitution industrialisation) neoliberal reforms that swept the nation's agricultural sector beginning in the 1980s. These reforms stimulated increased coffee production while simultaneously diminishing state interventions, including agricultural subsidies, farmer credits, research and development programmes, extension services, and rural development initiatives. These changes were closely followed by major restructuring of the global coffee market and the elimination of international coffee export quotas. Our research joins a growing body of recent literature exploring how changes related to market liberalisation and globalisation affect localities and regions where producers supply coffee for conventional markets. Through a case study, we describe the impacts of neoliberal globalisation on the lives, livelihoods, and environment of small-scale coffee producers in Minas Gerais, Brazil. We explore how neoliberal reform, reflected in the specific historical, geographical, and environmental context of Brazilian coffee production, has resulted in the increased marginalisation of small-scale farmers, the degradation of soils, and overall rural decline.

T1  - Multi-agent simulations to explore rules for rural credit in a highland farming community of Northern Thailand
AN  - 36937337; 3753888
AB  - Multi-agent systems (MAS) open new modelling and analysis perspectives in ecological and social sciences. An original characteristic of the companion modelling (ComMod) approach adopted in this case study is the co-construction and use of a MAS model with and for local stakeholders such as farmers and local administrators. Alternating iteratively field and modelling activities, this approach facilitates collective learning among local stakeholders and between them and the researchers. Combining the use of MAS models with role-playing games (RPG), the described experiment aimed to facilitate collective decision-making in a socially heterogeneous community of small farmers in mountainous Northern Thailand about the local rules for the allocation of rural credit to allow a more equitable and extensive process of expansion of non-erosive perennial crops in a watershed prone to erosion. This paper presents the MAS model and the results of a series of simulations exploring the ecological, social and economic effects of various rules for formal and informal credit suggested by the villagers-participants. Six scenarios considered as pertinent to further explore the participants' suggestions were defined based on different combinations among the following three variables: (i) Duration for the reimbursement of loans, (ii) Mode of allocation of formal credit among three different types of farms, (iii) Configuration of networks of acquaintances for access to informal credit. Drawing on this case study, we first elaborate on the potential of bottom-up models such as MAS to analyze the functioning of agricultural systems, in particular farm differentiation and rural credit dynamics. We highlight the ability of MAS to deal with interactions between social and ecological dynamics and to provide an alternative to classical economic thinking by analyzing the effects at the village level of social interactions among individuals. MAS allow us in particular to trigger an overlooked but nevertheless fundamental aspect of socio-ecological systems, i.e. social capital which is a determining factor when dealing with sustainability issues. The second question addressed in this paper deals with the potential and limits of MAS models to support a bottom-up (or participatory) modelling approach. This experiment suggests that the usefulness of models relies much more on the modelling process than on the model itself, because a model is usually useless if it is misunderstood by its potential users, or if it does not respond to their current preoccupations. The intuitive representation of real systems provided by MAS and their high flexibility are the two underlined characteristics favouring their appropriation by local stakeholders.

T1  - Are Sustainable Coffee Certifications Enough to Secure Farmer Livelihoods? The Millenium Development Goals and Nicaragua's Fair Trade Cooperatives
AN  - 61675715; 200830860
AB  - In December 2001, green coffee commodity prices hit a 30-year low. This deepened the livelihood crisis for millions of coffee farmers and rural communities. The specialty coffee industry responded by scaling up several sustainable coffee certification programs, including Fair Trade. This study uses household- and community-level research conducted in Nicaragua from 2000 to 2006 to assess the response to the post-1999 coffee crisis. A participatory action research team surveyed 177 households selling into conventional and Fair Trade markets in 2006. In an effort to dialogue with specialty coffee industry and mainstream development agencies, results are framed within the context of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Findings suggest that households connected to Fair Trade cooperatives experienced several positive impacts in education, infrastructure investment, and monetary savings. However, several important livelihoods insecurities, including low incomes, high emigration, and food insecurity, persisted among all small-scale producers. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 58778585; 2008-201522
AB  - In December 2001, green coffee commodity prices hit a 30-year low. This deepened the livelihood crisis for millions of coffee farmers and rural communities. The specialty coffee industry responded by scaling up several sustainable coffee certification programs, including Fair Trade. This study uses household- and community-level research conducted in Nicaragua from 2000 to 2006 to assess the response to the post-1999 coffee crisis. A participatory action research team surveyed 177 households selling into conventional and Fair Trade markets in 2006. In an effort to dialogue with specialty coffee industry and mainstream development agencies, results are framed within the context of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Findings suggest that households connected to Fair Trade cooperatives experienced several positive impacts in education, infrastructure investment, and monetary savings. However, several important livelihoods insecurities, including low incomes, high emigration, and food insecurity, persisted among all small-scale producers. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Improving small farmer participation in export marketing channels: perceptions of US fresh produce importers
AN  - 216864241
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to identify important elements of a strategy to facilitate small farmer participation in international supply chains for fresh produce. The study employs survey data collected from a national sample of US fresh produce importers. Their concerns and suggestions regarding potential for transactions with small Mexican farmers were assessed, with factor analysis providing a thematic summary of their perspectives. Results of the study reveal that US importers are not uniformly pessimistic about the ability of small farmers to meet their demands. On the contrary, almost one-third said they probably would work with small farmers in the near future. In general, importers are interested in transactions in which the product meets consumer and government expectations and is grown on the buyer's terms, the grower is reliable over time, the transaction is simplified, and the grower handles transportation. Importers rate small farmers poorly on their ability to achieve the last two factors, but these are also the items rated least important to the importers. New approaches to building market capacity in small farmers are also highly valued by the importers, including government investment guarantees, and arrangements for facilitating contact between importers and growers. More traditional methods, such as cooperatives and use of brokers, were not rated as highly. The study relies on cross-sectional, self-report data from one side of the grower/importer dyad. Incorporating longitudinal data with a dyadic perspective could provide additional insight. A practitioner perspective on the challenges in international fruit and vegetable supply chains, particularly as relates to developing countries, is of considerable value. Not only can governments choose improved policies for improving market readiness for the growers, but also members of supply chains themselves can identify tactics for ensuring successful transactions by enhancing coordination. The prospects for a win-win outcome for growers and importers are improved.

T1  - Benefits of value addition: a success story from the hills of Nepal
AN  - 815278396; 4134433
AB  - Agriculture is the main economic activity in Nepal, occupying more than 80 per cent of its workforce. Poverty is widespread and is largely a rural phenomenon. Over 70 per cent of the people earn less than US$2 a day (IFAD, 2007). Conventional approaches to alleviate poverty have met with partial success as they fail to address the real needs of the poor people. This article describes the experience gained by SNV (the Netherlands Development Organization) Nepal in the cardamon sub-sector through the promotion of improved drying techniques and the strengthening of key actors in the cardamom value chain. Initial results show that the use of improved dryers has provided smallholders with an additional income of $117 per hectare as a result of improvement in the quality of dry cardamom and savings in fuelwood, labour and cracking losses of cardamom capsules. These improvements in quality have additionally enabled traders to secure a higher price per tonne for cardamom from Taplejung. Recommendations to improve and sustain the enterprise include: addressing the problem of pests and disease; replacing old planting stock with those tolerant to pests and disease; modifying improved dryers to bring down costs; diversifying markets; implementing an effective marketing strategy; and forming a cardamom development board.

T1  - Rural market imperfections and the role of institutions in collective action to improve markets for the poor
AN  - 37186982; 3892317
AB  - Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa have liberalized markets to improve efficiency and enhance market linkages for smallholder farmers. The expected positive response by the private sector in areas with limited market infrastructure has however been very limited. The functioning of markets is constrained by high transaction costs and coordination problems along the production-to-consumption value chain. New kinds of institutional arrangements are needed to reduce these costs and fill the vacuum left when governments withdrew from markets in the era of structural adjustments. One of these institutional innovations has been the strengthening of producer organizations and formation of collective marketing groups as instruments to remedy pervasive market failures in rural economies. The analysis presented here with a case study from eastern Kenya has shown that marketing groups pay 20-25% higher prices than other buyers to farmers while participation was also positively correlated with adoption of improved dryland legume varieties, crops not targeted by the formal extension system. However the effectiveness of marketing groups is undermined by external shocks and structural constraints that limit the volume of trade and access to capital and information, and require investments in complementary institutions and coordination mechanisms to exploit scale economies. Successful groups have shown high levels of collective action in the form of increased participatory decision making, member contributions and initial start-up capital. Failure to pay on delivery, resulting from lack of capital credit, is a major constraint that stifles competitiveness of marketing groups relative to other buyers. These findings call for interventions that improve governance and participation; mechanisms for improving access to operating capital; and effective strategies for risk management and enhancing the business skills of farmer marketing groups.

T1  - Impacts of Chinese imports and coping strategies of local producers: the case of small-scale footwear enterprises in Ethiopia
AN  - 847230953
AB  - ABSTRACT              The footwear sector in Ethiopia is dominated by cheap imports from Asia, particularly from China. This has inflicted heavy impacts on the sector, and threatened its competitiveness in the domestic market. This study examines the impact of imports and coping strategies of firms to withstand the competition. Firm level data were gathered from micro, small and medium footwear enterprises. The findings revealed that Chinese shoes are superior in design, price and quality, with the result that they have taken over the domestic market. The impact of Chinese imports on local producers varied from downsizing, bankruptcy, loss of assets and property, to downgrading activities and informalising operations. Firms have pursued coping strategies that focused on improving design and quality, as well as lowering prices and profit margins. Coping strategies appear to be differentiated by size of firms, and have some association with the performance of firms. The ways forward for local producers should focus on collaborative engagements of stakeholders and government to overcome the competitive disadvantages of firms. Training, technology, quality control, benchmarking and reorganization of production should be designed as a package of intervention. In addition, strengthening local producers to engage in collective actions and promoting exports should also be given proper attention. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Impacts of Codes of Practice on Worker Livelihoods: Empirical Evidence from the South African Wine and Kenyan Cut Flower Industries
AN  - 211961641
AB  - This article presents the findings of an innovative, longitudinal, comparative study of the impacts of social and environmental codes of practice in the South African wine and Kenyan cut flower industries. The research aimed to provide systematic empirical evidence of whether such codes can make a difference to the livelihoods of workers, since this kind of evidence is lacking in the corporate responsibility discourse. Changes in the livelihoods of disaggregated groups of workers in terms of material, social and empowerment criteria were tracked and measured over a three-year period (2002-2005) in order to identify the specific impact of codes of practice. This paper sets out the findings regarding the material, social and empowerment outcomes for workers. It analyses the perspectives of company managers, sets out the issues regarding the wider impacts of codes for households, local communities, other key actors and institutions and explores the potential role of the emerging multi-stakeholder initiatives. In conclusion, the extent to which codes can make a positive contribution to workers in these (and other) agri-industries, the limitations of their power as a driver for change in highly inequitable value chains and the possibilities of seeking alternative strategies for workers and smallholders are discussed.

T1  - Coffee Price Volatility In Ethiopia: Effects Of Market Reform Programmes
AN  - 58768496; 2008-140439
AB  - This study presents the results of an empirical investigation into the effects of market reform programmes in Ethiopia and their impact on the volatility of coffee prices. The study covers the period from 1982 to the end of 2001, though its main focus is on the period after the commencement of the reforms in 1992. Using the Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) techniques, we argue that there is evidence that Ethiopia experienced a significant increase in coffee price volatility after the adoption of the market-oriented reform programmes. This is consistent with much of the literature. The econometric evidence presented in the paper, suggests that the market reform programmes were a significant cause of the increased volatility after 1992. The authors also suggest a number of possible policy responses to the price volatility, including strengthening the role of smallholder producer associations, and the possibility of adopting appropriate risk-management strategies. However, the institutional and structural characteristics of coffee production in Ethiopia within the global market for coffee may mitigate against the successful implementation of such policies. The fact that Ethiopia is a price-taker in this market and is therefore prone to external shocks in coffee prices over which it has little control or influence means that the country will continue to be highly vulnerable to the natural cycles that are endemic in the production of such primary commodities as coffee.

T1  - Farmers' markets as small business incubators and safety nets: Evidence from New Zealand
AN  - 212111016
AB  - The paper seeks to explore the importance of a sample of New Zealand farmers' markets in providing a supportive setting for the take-off as well as the decline stage of the small business life cycle, with a view to identifying factors that may enhance rural small business survivability.  The task was achieved by use of a combination of interviews and case studies. A list of new generation farmers' markets was compiled. Managers from four of these markets were interviewed to identify the possible existence of businesses that had been fostered by, but had now outgrown, the market. Four incubated businesses were selected from one of the longer established markets. From a more recently established market, 18 stallholders were selected for examination of their attitudes towards the market as a nurturing environment in relation to the life-cycle stage of the business. Data were analysed using qualitative techniques of theme identification and analysis. It was found that farmers' markets can have a role as small business incubators and safety nets, thus enhancing the survival chances of rural small businesses. This may be particularly useful where dwindling government subsidies and growing supermarket power result in declining incomes and reduced outlets for small-scale farmers and rural producers. The research findings are limited by the non-random nature of the sampling procedure. In such an exploratory study, the main emphasis was on establishing the existence of the incubator and safety net functions. Further research is needed to establish the extent of these roles. The research investigates a relatively unique setting of an unsubsidised agricultural sector. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Securing small farmer participation in supermarket supply chains in South Africa
AN  - 36874734; 3542027
AB  - Urbanisation and a growing middle class with changing consumption patterns provide an ideal setting for supermarkets to prosper. With South Africa's urban population approaching 60 per cent, supermarket retail chains are now important players in the agro-food sector. Over the last two decades they have begun to purchase produce from in-house sourcing companies who buy mainly from large-scale farmers. Together with the strict requirements of the retail groups, this makes it difficult for small-scale farmers to supply these retailers. This paper highlights the market changes that could continue to exclude small producers from mass consumer markets. It uses a case study to show how small farmers can be integrated into the urban retail market and, using evidence from this study, proposes a number of strategies to help them participate in the mainstream agro-food supply chains and an innovative model for including them while maintaining profitable business operations.

T1  - Loose Fruit Mamas: Creating Incentives for Smallholder Women in Oil Palm Production in Papua New Guinea
AN  - 58750604; 2007-21286
AB  - This paper presents a case study of the introduction of a more gender equitable payment scheme for oil palm smallholders in Papua New Guinea. Women are now paid separately from their husbands for their work on family oil palm plots thereby increasing the economic incentives for women to commit labor to oil palm production. The study incorporates broader local cultural and economic processes in the analysis of intra-household gender and labor relations to explain how the new payment systems successfully resolved intra-household disputes over labor and income. The paper highlights the critical role export firms can play in enhancing women's access to commodity crop income. Further, the paper demonstrates that by widening the framework of household analysis, insights can be gained into two key questions that have received only limited attention in the literature: the question of why men do not share a greater proportion of cash crop income with other family members; and, the apparent inability of families to resolve intra-household conflicts over income.

T1  - Changing agrarian status in Himachal Pradesh: problems and remedies
AN  - 36913275; 3563062
AB  - The marginal and small holdings in Himachal Pradesh have been continuously increasing over the period. The average size of farm holdings is 1.21 ha. Majority of the farmers have poor resource base and carry on subsistence farming. Keeping this in view, the present study was undertaken to analyse the problems faced by marginal and small farmers and to suggest ways and means for improving their income. Both primary and secondary data were analyzed. The findings of the study have clearly brought out that the large holdings have decreased, while small and marginal holdings increased over the years in the state resulting in higher human labour pressure on agriculture. This trend calls for not only to reduce the increased population dependent on agriculture to lift from subsistence to sustainable level but also to withdraw population from agriculture by opening up alternative employment opportunities. The net sown area and gross cropped area in the state have declined. The cropping intensity on marginal farms was higher than small farms showing inverse relation between farm size and area sown. The farmers leased out their land for cultivation on produce sharing basis followed by fixed kind and money contract, respectively. The produce sharing tenancy was noticed the dominant form of tenancy. Majority of leased out land transferred was done to OBCs followed by Scheduled Castes and majority of sample study showed that average farm income accounted for 32 per cent while 68 per cent was obtained from non-farm activities. Heavy indebtedness, draught, migration, increasing cost of production and low level of adoption of technology were the problems of these farmers. The findings of the sample survey are in conformity with the results obtained at the state level which implies that the maladies which exist at the farm level are identical at the macro level and as such the same remedies would be applicable at micro as well as macro level to make agriculture sustainable and economically viable. Diversification of agriculture, enhancement of productivity and environmental safety need to be the main areas of thrust. There is also need to change the tenurial act so that land kept fallow by the farmers can be brought under cultivation.

T1  - The role of social distance in sharecropping efficiency: The case of two rice-growing villages in Nepal
AN  - 220679721
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding of the role of culture in general, and social distance in particular, in influencing the choice and efficiency of various contractual modes in developing country agriculture. It aims to focus on sharecropping, but the model of social distance can be applied to any contract, mainly those in close-knit village societies. Principal components analysis (PCA) is used in the study to develop a social distance index for all sharecroppers, which is included as an independent variable in land productivity ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. Findings indicate social distance is a key determinant in sharecropping efficiency for marginal tenant farmers in rural Nepal. Specifically, social distance is found to be a significant factor in explaining land productivity differentials between owned land and sharecropped land. From a policy standpoint, the results suggest that a relatively egalitarian agrarian structure, insofar as it results in lower social distances among parties to land and labor contracts, would have a positive impact on productivity. Therefore, the object of agrarian reforms should not be to alter or constrain the form of contracts (for example by banning sharecropping) but rather to improve the social relations among contracting parties.

T1  - Small farm systems to feed hungry Asia
AN  - 36757392; 3470526
AB  - Small farms are an integral part of Asian agriculture. They are characterized by the preponderance and emphasis on mixed crop-animals systems across a variety of agroecological zones. Mixed farming is the backbone of agriculture, many categories of which are models of diversification, efficiency and resilience in Asia. In global terms, small farms in Asia account for an estimated 87% of all farms of under two hectares of land. About 52% of these farms have <1 ha, with the smallest sizes (0.3-0.6 ha) being found in China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. There are three types of small farms: in irrigated areas, rainfed zones and plantation agriculture. The first category greatly benefited from policy support and massive resource inputs through the `green revolution', while the second was bypassed by it, but continues to produce the bulk of the ruminant meats and milk. The third type remains neglected. The rural poor are mainly small farmers and landless agricultural labourers; their characteristics are described in detail. Irrespective of their various definitions, the key descriptors are deprivation, subsistence, illiteracy, survival, and because of globalization, vulnerability. Data from various sources indicate some key features concerning Asian agriculture: about 83% of the agricultural area is rainfed; between 51% and 55% of the total population of cattle and goats is found here; and about 59-60% of poor livestock keepers are found on mixed farms. The development of small farms in rainfed environments is a priority for the future and affirmative action is imperative. The strategies for development include the promotion of animal production as the entry point for food production and total factor productivity; integrated use of natural resources; improved feeding and nutrition; interdisciplinary, participatory and holistic approaches to address system constraints; and strengthening access to information and delivery systems. Effective policies are urgently required to spur this initiative; these should include development policy for small farm systems; intensifying the role of animals in integrated systems; improved rural-urban marketing linkages, infrastructure and cokmmunications. The development pathways include needs-based intensification of animal production systems; improving diversification with the appropriate mix of animals that can be integrated with annual and perennial crops; ensuring access to improved technologies and markets; strengthening empowerment; promotion of cooperatives and agri-business; and sustained pro-poor initiatives to reduce poverty and hunger that are consistent with income growth, socioeconomic benefits, improved livelihoods and self-reliance.

T1  - Nobody farms here anymore: Livelihood diversification in the Amazonian community of Carvão, a historical perspective
AN  - 214180943
AB  - Over the past 15 years income sources in the Amazonian community of Carvao have diversified to include government salaries, retirement and welfare benefits, and wages from an evolving informal service sector. These non-farm incomes are now more important to household incomes than the sale of agricultural products. Out of 80 households only three families were found to depend almost entirely on the sale of agricultural goods for cash income. Agriculture is still a part of most families&rsquo; livelihoods; however, production today is mainly a subsistence activity. Recent changes in Carvao are consistent with trends of livelihood diversification observed in rural societies across the globe. However, current research reveals that Carvao is different from other case studies in a number of ways. A history of livelihoods illustrates that residents in Carvao have always engaged in a range of activities, including farming, extractive activities, and wage labor. New incomes are the result of new jobs in the public sector and social policies benefiting the rural poor. In contrast to the literature on livelihood diversification, the decentralization of the federal government in Brazil has resulted in greater opportunities for rural income and employment. Consistent with recorded trends, research shows that small farmers in Carvao have down-sized agricultural production. Farmers cite low market prices (the result of vertical integration of local markets) as one cause of this decline. Residents, especially small farmers, interested in diversifying agricultural production are limited by inadequate extension services and credit, and younger residents seek public sector employment. Income diversification has increased livelihoods security; however, future livelihoods will depend on new economic growth. Given the stagnating public sector and a weak industrial sector, production geared toward growing urban markets is a viable means for further income generation in Carvao. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Farmer organisation and enhanced access to markets
AN  - 199968180
AB  - The main challenges facing smallholder farmers are that they often cannot meet strict food safety and quality control requirements and they are seldom able to provide sufficient volumes of products on a near-continuous basis. The problem is that the enthusiasm for farmer organizations has, at times, obscured the fact that establishing viable organizations is not a simple process. This article explores these issues in the context of commodity maize in Mexico and high-value vegetables in Honduras and El Salvador. While there are advantages to farmer organization when it comes to accessing inputs, farmers report that there are no advantages to establishing a farmer organization to sell grain. The research suggested that the benefits of farmer organization are more evident in the vegetable sector characterized by high transaction costs associated with market access.

T1  - The Impacts of Codes of Practice on Worker Livelihoods: Empirical Evidence from the South African Wine and Kenyan Cut Flower Industries
AN  - 58760225; 2008-133034
AB  - This article presents the findings of an innovative, longitudinal, comparative study of the impacts of social and environmental codes of practice in the South African wine and Kenyan cut flower industries. The research aimed to provide systematic empirical evidence of whether such codes can make a difference to the livelihoods of workers, since this kind of evidence is lacking in the corporate responsibility discourse. Changes in the livelihoods of disaggregated groups of workers in terms of material, social and empowerment criteria were tracked and measured over a three-year period (2002-2005) in order to identify the specific impact of codes of practice. This paper sets out the findings regarding the material, social and empowerment outcomes for workers. It analyses the perspectives of company managers, sets out the issues regarding the wider impacts of codes for households, local communities, other key actors and institutions and explores the potential role of the emerging multi-stakeholder initiatives. In conclusion, the extent to which codes can make a positive contribution to workers in these (and other) agri-industries, the limitations of their power as a driver for change in highly inequitable value chains and the possibilities of seeking alternative strategies for workers and smallholders are discussed.

T1  - Extension Strategies for Poverty Alleviation: Lessons from China and India
AN  - 61898868; EJ830204
AB  - This paper discusses the transition from a national focus on food security during the last half of the 20th century to an emerging strategy on helping small-scale farm households increase farm income to reduce rural poverty. The basic proposition is that if extension is going to help increase farm incomes and rural employment, then it must shift from being a "supply-driven" to a more "market-driven" extension system. This shift requires at least three major institutional changes. First, extension must give higher priority to high-value, labor-intensive crops/products where there is real demand in domestic and/or export markets. Second, small-scale producers must get organized into groups to achieve economies of scale and to become linked with the "value chains" that supply these markets. Third, extension planning and decision-making must become decentralized to determine the most suitable crops and/or enterprises vis-a-vis the interests and resources of different farmer groups, in light of agro-ecological conditions and available markets for different products.

T1  - Socio-Economic Reasons for the Low Adoption of Water Conservation Technologies by Smallholder Farmers in Southern Africa: A Review of the Literature
AN  - 59956878; 2007-04572
AB  - Natural resource degradation and water scarcity, which threaten the sustainability of smallholder farmers' livelihoods in semi-arid developing areas, are a global concern. Although researchers have developed water-conservation technologies (WCTs), adoption rates by smallholder farmers have been low. This article compares the perspectives of researchers and smallholder farmers, highlights the discrepancies which explain the farmers' low uptake of technologies and addresses the socio-economic factors affecting adoption. It argues that WCTs are diverse and applicable to different time and spatial scales and hence dependent upon context. These traits influence the dissemination and adoption of WCTs, and should not be ignored, from the early stage of technology development. It explains that adoption depends not only on individual farmers' willingness but also on property rights to resources and collective community action. The article discusses the demand for WCTs, the role of the public sector and research and related biases, and makes recommendations for achieving more sustainable rural livelihoods. Recent experiences in South Africa show that encouraging farmers to participate in technology development, taking account of local indigenous knowledge and making sound institutional arrangements are some ways to foster better integration of technology and innovation.

T1  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN RURAL MICRO AGRI -LINKED BUSINESSES
AN  - 213619412
AB  - Rural micro agriculture linked businesses though encountered perennial problems of research crunch, offers immense growth, employment co-efficient & implication for distribution in agrarian economy of district Kathua, J&K State. Their emergence is the result of unremunerative & seasonal character of agriculture, marginalization of small farmers, eviction of tenants and a number of policy measures initiated by the Govt. for promoting self-employment. The paper examines the significance of background and key motivational factors in sustaining rural micro entrepreneurship using X2, tests of significance and factor analysis. The study suggests adoption of an integrated & multidisciplinary development approach by including training, institutional, financial support as a composite package coupled with improved technology in agriculture to create 'income and output' effect which in -turn would increase raw material & demand for rurally produced goods.

T1  - PARTICIPATORY VARIETY SELECTION IN THE ETHIOPIAN CEREAL TEF (ERAGROSTIS TEF)
AN  - 203137892
AB  - Participatory variety selection (PVS) was carried out in two of the major tef-growing woredas (districts) of Ethiopia, Ada and Akaki, in 2003 and 2004. The objectives were to identify farmers' selection criteria, to increase farmers' awareness and their access to improved tef varieties, to enable farmers to assess the performances of improved tef varieties of their choice and to accelerate seed dissemination of farmers' chosen varieties through farmer-to-farmer exchange mechanisms. Seed colour was the overriding selection criterion. Farmers overwhelmingly selected the very white seed variety DZ-01-196 (Magna) for market purposes, indicating that tef is a cash crop. Farmers also selected brown-seeded tef, but for home consumption. There was no evidence of connection between seed colour and desirable agronomic traits, or nutritional quality (protein content). Factors other than seed-colour were of secondary concern to farmers. When market demands become the dominant selection criteria, PVS should not be an end by itself: rather, it complements the formal breeding system. The results imply that tef performance evaluation trials need to be separated on a colour-group basis, and any new successful variety in the two woredas should be superior to DZ-01-196 not only in grain yield but also in seed-colour quality. A faster, more efficient and reliable pure-seed supply system than the traditional farmer-to-farmer exchange mechanism is required in order for farmers to continue planting improved varieties, which might be better achieved through small-scale commercial producers and/or cooperatives.

T1  - Smallholder Participation and Certification of Organic Farm Products in Mexico
AN  - 62149154; EJ724352
AB  - Organic and other environmental and social marketing devices seek to connect producers and consumers more directly and reward environmentally and socially superior production systems. Some researchers have observed that these schemes may introduce mechanisms of exclusion, creating an elite group of certified smallholders while putting non-certified farmers at a distinct disadvantage and introducing division among people whose true interest may lie more in relations of solidarity and cooperation. The trade and regulatory environment that smallholder coops must navigate is increasingly complex and adaptation to its requirements has important implications for farmer organizations. Standards applied to certify smallholder production systems tend to be developed with regard to first-world consumer interests and imposed in a top-down fashion by certification agencies and intermediaries, with little or no farmer participation. Especially in the tropics, agricultural standards that reflect temperate country conditions may place unnecessary burdens on growers who attempt to meet agronomic norms that are irrelevant to local agroecologies. After providing a summary of organic farming and certification in Mexico over the past two decades, we discuss three emerging trends: the advent of contract agriculture in organic production, the appearance of a new, environmentally-based coffee certification system intended to favor bird conservation, and a recent government program to support transition to organic production. All three trends involve certain contradictions, both with the foundational social and ecological goals of organic agriculture and with the interests of small farmers.

T1  - Why do small-scale producers choose to produce under contract? Lessons from nontraditional vegetable exports from Zimbabwe
AN  - 229641456
AB  - This article explores the motivations behind the decision of small-scale producers to grow nontraditional vegetables under contract for export. Based on a survey of small-scale producers in Zimbabwe, four factors are identified as motivating contracting, namely, market uncertainty, indirect benefits (e.g., knowledge acquisition), income benefits, and intangible benefits. Respondents are clustered according to the relative importance of these factors in their contracting decision. Four clusters are identified and related to the characteristics of these farmers including size of the farm, amount of land devoted to export crops, access to alternative markets, and the proportion of family income derived from export crops. The results suggest that there are systematic differences between farmers in their decisions to contract which needs to be recognized in contract design and management.   [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Confronting the coffee crisis: can fair trade, organic, and specialty coffees reduce small-scale farmer vulnerability in northern Nicaragua?
AN  - 58850654; 2005-0402240
AB  - This paper links changing global coffee markets to opportunities and vulnerabilities for sustaining small-scale farmer livelihoods in northern Nicaragua. Changing governance structures, corporate concentration, oversupply, interchangeable commodity grade beans, and low farm gate prices characterize the crisis in conventional coffee markets. In contrast, certified Fair Trade and organic are two alternative forms of specialty coffee trade and production that may offer opportunities for small-scale producers. A research team surveyed 228 farmers to measure the impact of sales on organic and Fair Trade markets. The results suggest that participation in organic and Fair Trade networks reduces farmers' livelihood vulnerability.

T1  - Advancing global health and equity one cup at a time
AN  - 232078753; 15913268
AB  - Nursing organizations worldwide support the MDG initiative. The International Council of Nurses chose working against poverty as the theme for last year's International Nurses Day, reinforcing that health and poverty are inextricably linked. Furthermore, CNA states that global health is a fundamental human right, which should be accessible to all no matter how much one earns or where one lives (Canadian Nurses Association, 2004). CNA stresses that one way to achieve health is to "ensure adequate income, food, education and shelter, a stable eco-system, sustainable resources, peace, social justice and equity for all."              The fair trade movement has demonstrated that trade can make a sustainable and significant contribution to improving the lives of producers and workers, while protecting natural resources and the environment. Some Fair Trade Certified products, particularly coffee, have achieved noticeable market penetration, indicating a degree of consumer acceptance in which the ethical attribute offsets price sensitivity (Gould, 2003). Fair trade principles include an emphasis on corporate social responsibility rather than profit maximization. Fair trade partnerships are based on dialogue, transparency and respect. In Guatemala, three fair trade cooperatives, representing more than 2,000 members, developed medical insurance programs for members and their families. Women were empowered and one group now roasts and sells coffee to local markets (TransFair Canada, 2005).              A number of organizations, universities, unions and municipal governments now promote fair trade as a viable and dynamic alternative to conventional trade. In Canada, TransFair Canada (www.transfair.ca) is the only independent certification body for fair trade products. The Fair Trade Certified logo signifies that importers and distributors are purchasing the coffee beans, cocoa or tea from democratically organized groups of small farmers who adhere to monitoring criteria and standards set by Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (www.fairtrade.net). This process guarantees that the price of the product covers the cost of production and gives decent wages to employees. This includes sustainable production practices that reduce harm to the environment and that prohibit child or forced labour.

T1  - Agricultural Resource Planning through-IT platform —An approach
AN  - 884041379
AB  - Agriculture happens to be the mainstay of Indian Economy. Even today seventy percentage of the population depend on agriculture as the core economic activity. Nevertheless as the commodity market is the farmers -- particularly the small farmer are unable even to cover their cost of production. Unlike in US-EU they do not have a back up of significant subsidy. The result is a diminished attractiveness of agriculture as a paying industry. The farmers mostly operate in production segment of the value chain and as such is not in a position the capture major share of the total value created. In fact much of the value created by this chain is captured by the segments both upstream & downstream of this chain. It is a fact that in the current scenario -- the powerless (economic) farmers cannot do much because of immense competition in the production segment. However this paper makes an attempt to capture some more value with the help of some more knowledge captured through an IT platform.              This paper proposes an economic model that integrates through a computer network some of the upstream segments like the producing centers, Market, logistics so that the farmers can capture some more value. This paper proposes a network environment for the producers as well as the marketing associates which can use the IT tools to forecast commodity prices in different markets and accordingly advice the farmers to shift this producer to a particular Mundi for an expected price recovery. ARP -- as its called (Agricultural Resource Planning) will help the farmer to the extent that the latter knows that for maximization of value capture he needs to sell his commodity in which market. This also calls for free movement of grain / commodity to different market. This exercise will help reduce some of the uncertainty associated with today's production-logistics-sale-scenario.              This model is proposed and not tested yet. Model results can be discussed once it is put on test at least with a control group of farmers.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

TT  - Public policies and settlement projects
AN  - 620660012; 2005-00727-009
AB  - To analyze the existing relationship between public policies and settlement projects for agricultural reform, we investigated the beliefs and the expectations of settlers as well as those of the Paraíba INCRA's technicians, in terms of public policies towards rural development, as regards settlement projects. The study group was made out of 4 INCRA rural development agents and 52 settlers, thus producing a sample of 56 members. The results showed that settlers and technicians believe that the parcel shape of the settlement organization runs better than the agro-villa format. Settlers say that they maintain a poor relationship with their neighboring small growers, while describing them as prejudiced people. The two groups of partakers believe that PRONAF brings few benefits, a higher difficulty in the way of payment and slowness in the approval of the projects and the liberation of resources, if compared to PROCERA, the previous program of credit. Settlers and technicians agree on attributing the role of technical assistance to the INCRA rural development agents, as regards the organization of agricultural and cattle raising activities, implementation of the association and cooperative settlement, and also in terms of social structure. However, partakers believe that the State should play such a role as to manage the required conditions towards a better running of the settlement.

T1  - The impact of European market changes on employment in the Kenyan horticulture sector
AN  - 214913073
AB  - In Kenya, exports of fresh vegetables have grown rapidly in the past decade, but the employment impact of this business has been changing as a result of market conditions in the major export destination, the United Kingdom. Continued rapid growth in overall exports, an increase in post-harvest processing, a switch from smallholder production to exporters' own plantations, and price shocks such as tariff changes and shifts in transport costs. A simulation exercise demonstrates that the positive impact on employment of continued export growth and increased post-harvest processing is much greater than any likely reduction in employment resulting from the shift away from smallholder production.

T1  - Improving agri-food marketing in developing economies: contractual vegetable markets in Ghana
AN  - 57119425; 259940
AB  - Reviews vegetable marketing in Ghana in order to suggest how the development of contractual institutions can enhance market coordination. In agricultural trading, personal relationships are extremely important in facilitating, among other things, the provision of commercial advice and credit. Reputation is important, and transactions are frequently personalised. Such relationships reduce transaction costs and result in more efficient marketing. Informal relationships also provide safeguards where business practices are not sophisticated. Describes the agricultural sector in Ghana. Fieldwork was designed to gather evidence of marketing problems and suggest potential solutions; ten villages were selected by District Directors of Agriculture. Four skilled enumerators were employed locally and trained for the survey, which was done under the supervision of the local collaborator from ISSERE, University of Ghana at Legon. Data were analysed using descriptive statistical procedures. Discusses findings. (Original abstract)

T1  - Community groups and livelihoods in remote rural areas of Ghana: how small-scale farmers sustain collective action
AN  - 57115155; 251798
AB  - Community groups such as those involved in food trading, micro-finance and road building can play an important role in sustaining the livelihoods and reducing poverty in rural Africa. While many groups collapse without donor support, the factors that allow some groups to be sustained are examined by looking at a range of community development related groups. The use of subsidies is questioned as it can result in groups becoming dependent on donors. The ability to build up trust and cooperation is shown to be based on long-term learning processes, simple flexible rules established by members, the ability to enforce rules and allowing people to manage their own income.

T1  - Economic Reform and Repeasantization in Post-1990 Cuba
AN  - 60097068; 200509225
AB  - In the early 1990s Cuba initiated a new phase of social transformation, driven forward by an economic reform. Some aspects of that reform resembled orthodox structural adjustment, while others differed from it. In agriculture the reform reshaped state farms into multiple cooperatives, subdivided cooperative production, liberalized produce markets, & ceded land to individual parceleros. Through interviews with policy makers & cooperative leaders, & a survey of small farmers in western & eastern Cuba, I examined the reform's impact on small farmers' production. I found that two important patterns characterized the 1990s: first, "repeasantization" occurred; & second, income disparities between these two regions were maintained, if not expanded. Yet, even in poorer regions, small farmers are modestly better off than the average salary earner, while in other regions they are substantially better off. In sum, Cuba's economic crisis forced the reshaping of agricultural policy in ways that fortified the position of small farmers. 3 Tables, 24 References. Adapted from the source document.
