T1  - Bridging scenario planning and backcasting: A Q-analysis of divergent stakeholder priorities for future landscapes
AN  - 2793865092
AB  - Many landscapes in sub-Saharan Africa have undergone rapid changes, often with negative social and ecological impacts. Avoiding (or reversing) such negative impacts requires proactive landscape planning. Scenario planning, a participatory approach that generates narratives of plausible landscape change trajectories in the future, has been widely used to support landscape planning and decisions. However, not least because of challenges arising from group dynamics, few examples exist where backcasting—the collective envisioning of a desirable future landscape and the identification of pathways to reach that future—has been applied in landscape planning.In this study, building on past scenario planning work in southwestern Ethiopia, we begin to fill this empirical and methodological gap. Specifically, we used the Q-methodology to elucidate stakeholders' divergent landscape aspirations in a case study in southwestern Ethiopia.Our results show that many stakeholders share a similar vision of building a future landscape that supports smallholder-based development. However, details in the envisaged pathways differ between stakeholders. Three distinct pathways were prioritized by different stakeholders: (1) Agroecological production, (2) Coffee investment and (3) Intensive food crop production. Accounting for these divergent aspirations is important when taking further steps in landscape planning.We show how using the Q-methodology as a subjective assessment of stakeholders' landscape priorities can facilitate the integration of backcasting within the normative process of landscape planning. Our approach thus helps navigate conflicting stakeholders' preferences and based on that, carefully plan collective action towards a shared landscape vision.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

T1  - Understanding heterogeneity in technology adoption among Indonesian smallholder dairy farmers
AN  - 2793487096
AB  - This study aims to understand and profile smallholder farmers' technology adoption status. We collected cross‐sectional data from 600 smallholder dairy farming households in West Java, Indonesia. A Latent class cluster analysis identified two unique clusters of smallholder dairy farmers based on patterns in their adoption status of multiple dairy farming technologies. Cluster 1 (Low awareness/low adoption) had significantly lower awareness of all technologies, and among the “aware” farmers, technology adoption rates were also significantly lower compared to Cluster 2 (High awareness/high adoption). The Low awareness/low adoption cluster was older, had less formal education, managed fewer dairy cows, had less productive and less profitable dairy enterprises, lived further away from their cooperative and farmer group leader, and had fewer contacts with dairy extension staff. Farmers' responses to questions regarding reasons underpinning nonadoption decisions suggest that farmers face multilayered and heterogenous constraints to adopting dairy technologies. This insight can assist government, policymakers, and development professionals in designing technology dissemination programs that meet the unique characteristics of subgroups of farmers, ultimately improving the adoption of technologies.

T1  - Access to mutual labour support in agriculture: Implications for maize productivity and efficiency of farmers in northern Ghana
AN  - 2787123745
AB  - ABSTRACTAccess to cheap labour affects Ghanaian smallholder farmers significantly. Such access can be enhanced through mutual labour support. However, it has become necessary to explore how this form of collective action affects farmers’ productivity and efficiency. In this study, the impact of access to mutual labour support on productivity and technical efficiency was estimated using data collected from 592 smallholder maize farmers in Northern Ghana. The study uses a translog stochastic production frontier model, while accounting for sample selection bias that may emanate from both observable and unobservable household characteristics. Farmers with access to mutual labour support are significantly more productive and technically efficient than those without, with mean technical efficiency in the range of 0.62–0.71 for farmers with access to mutual labour support and 0.55–0.60 for those without access. Sex, education, spraying machine ownership, farm size, extension visits, access to credit, and membership of farmer-based organisation are significant determinants of access to mutual labour support. Policies to help farmer groups and extension agents promote mutual labour support accessibility among farmers are recommended.

T1  - Tackling climate change under time‐poverty: Cooperatives as temporal pacers
AN  - 2771302756
AB  - We help to unravel how smallholder farmers in agricultural cooperatives can address the consequences of climate change. Climate change‐oriented actions often pose an extra challenge to cooperative members in time‐poverty, that is, to those who have no choice but to work long hours yet remain consumption poor. Tackling climate change requires future‐oriented action toward unpredictable events, whereas time‐poverty requires people to deal with the bare necessities of the present. Through a qualitative inductive study of Rwandan smallholder farmers in agricultural cooperatives, we observe that climate change increases time‐poverty, especially for women, and that smallholder farmers are hesitant to invest their time in making climate change adaptations. We find that smallholder farmers can overcome these challenges through membership of agricultural cooperatives, which can help in pacing climate change actions.

T1  - An Agri-environmental Scheme for Reducing Inputs Subjected to Accidental Spillage: An Application to Agricultural Burnings by Smallholders
AN  - 2768982783
AB  - Command-and-control (CAC) is the dominant approach for regulating agricultural fires in developing countries, despite its negative impact on low-income smallholders. Agri-environmental schemes are emerging as an alternative and this paper presents a scheme for hiring the reduction of inputs liable to be accidentally spilled. This is applied to burned area reduction by smallholders, with the governmental principal exposed to great risk due to the coupling of the need to advance subsidy and unobservability of both intended burned area and heterogeneous reduction cost. Optimal contract menus were derived for three situations differing in the number of contracts in which non-compliance could be detected irrespective of accidents’ size. A rate of 99% of the perfect information efficiency was achieved, as revealed by a numerical simulation based on a range of Brazilian Amazon datasources, including a discrete choice experiment, satellite fire data and mechanization cost. Results were robust to parametric sensitivity analysis, which also pointed to a small contribution by high cost smallholders of up to 10% of total reduction. CAC proved inefficient by pooling together smallholders differing substantially on cost, revealing that contracts are recommendable as a better policy option.

T1  - Participatory Action Research, Social Networks, and Gender Influence Soil Fertility Management in Tanzania
AN  - 2764836255
AB  - Abstract Transformation of knowledge systems and fostering learning among smallholder farmers such as through participatory action research (PAR) is key to agricultural growth in rural sub-Saharan Africa. We investigate how PAR influences uptake/use of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) while accounting for gendered, bonding and bridging social capital. Stratified by engagement in a mother-baby PAR and by resource endowments, 607 smallholder farmers were sampled from northern Tanzania. Binary logistic and multinomial logit models revealed that full engagement in PAR was associated with early adoption of inorganic fertilizers, either as a dichotomous decision or an ISFM bundle with improved varieties, organic matter inputs and soil and water conservation. Bonding social capital through cooperatives, farmer groups, and farmer-farmer local networks supports soil and water conservation, especially among resource-poor farmers. Among the high-resource farmers, increased women’s bargaining power in farm input purchases supports fertilizer and manure use while increased bargaining power in livestock tending supports crop residue incorporation. ISFM usage is constrained by age of decision-makers and a higher number of dependents per worker while education level and farm sizes increase its likelihood. In the resource-constrained, with low extension and technical support, and men-dominated patrilineal farming systems of Africa, the study places PAR, social networks, and gender inclusivity as key approaches for improving smallholder’ ISFM.

T1  - DETERMINANTS OF FARMERS' DECISION TO CHOICE MARKET OUTLETS: EVIDENCE FROM MILK PRODUCER FARMERS IN ADA'A BERGA DISTRICT ETHIOPIA
AN  - 2802524591
AB  - In Ethiopia, many initiatives have been implemented to empower smallholder dairy farmers to develop viable livelihoods from the sector. The problem with these policies is the inability to reach farmers at large, and dairy farmers in rural areas are always challenged to deliver milk and milk products faster to the final market. The study was aimed at investigating factors that influence market channel choices among dairy producers in Ada'a Berga district Ethiopia. This paper uses data from a survey of 123 dairy producer households in four rural kebeles to analyse the factors that influence the choice of a milk marketing channel. Multivariate probit econometric model results show that income from dairy source, market information and educational level of household affected wholesaler outlet. The choice of consumer outlet is influenced by family size, membership in a dairy cooperative, market information, non-dairy income and income from dairy source. Number of milking cows, membership in a dairy cooperative and non-dairy income determined the choice of dairy cooperative outlet. The choice of district retailer's market outlet was affected by sex of households, membership in a dairy cooperative and income from dairy sources. Choice of rural collector outlet is negatively influenced by non-dairy income and access to an extension contact. Therefore, policies should be designed that encourage farmers' cooperatives, contract farming and collective action in order to lower transaction costs, expand market information for dairy producers, expand extension services and expand infrastructures such as road and transportation facilities, which are needed to promote the effective marketing of milk through all outlets.

T1  - Farmer Cooperatives and the Limits of Agricultural Reform in Rural Hubei
AN  - 2779834658
AB  - There has been remarkable growth in the number of cooperatives in China in the past decade. This article asks: what role are cooperatives playing in driving China’s ambitious agricultural reforms? The scholarly literature describes farmer cooperatives as either an important entity for progressing China’s rural modernization agenda, a vehicle of exploitation and dispossession of smallholder farmers, or evidence of broader commitment to grassroots solidarity. Despite the rapid expansion of farmer cooperatives, the role that they play in the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in places where agriculture remains central and out-migration is low is poorly understood. To explore this, in 2019 we conducted a survey of 266 households in the mountains of Hubei Province. To illuminate the politics and dynamics on the ground, we followed up by conducting in-depth interviews with agribusinesses, cooperatives, households, and local government officials. Our findings suggest that although cooperatives are attempting to engage with smallholders, they are neither integrating nor exploiting them. While seemingly innocuous to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, these entities serve a mostly political function, and it is in these dynamics that we observe the limits of agricultural reform. Where smallholder production is lucrative, land is valuable, and out-migration is minimal, local government appears to be “performing” reform, without forcing it on smallholders and thereby harming the local economy or risking social unrest.

T1  - The Determinants of Smallholder Farmers on the Functionality of Plant Health Clinics in the Vhembe District, South Africa
AN  - 2779418905
AB  - A plant health clinic is a system in which under-resourced and smallholder farmers can access basic services of plant healthcare from a plant clinic in relation to infected or symptomatic plants and plant products for pest diagnostic and identification purposes. The factors that influence smallholder farmers’ awareness and accessibility to plant health clinics in the Vhembe District Municipality of Limpopo Province, South Africa were examined in this study. The study also identified the constraints of the plant clinics that prevent their effective utilization. Three-hundred and twenty smallholder farmers (n = 320) from the population of 1600 were interviewed through a semi-structured questionnaire. A multistage random sampling technique was employed to select the 320 smallholder farmers from 8 irrigation schemes in the study area. To ensure representation, all categories of smallholder farmers were included in the study. Descriptive statistics such as frequency and percentages and Logit regression model were employed for the data analyses. The results revealed that there is a statistically significant and positive relation between communication channels and plant clinics awareness and accessibility among smallholder farmers. The distance to plant clinics has a negative influence on the accessibility of plant clinics among the farmers; however, the accessibility of plant clinic improves when visits by extension officers or plant doctors to farmers increase. The study pointed out some challenges affecting the functionality of plant clinics, which could be resolved through an efficient and effective plant clinic framework that involves major role players. An efficient and effective plant clinic framework was therefore developed by the study to improve its usefulness for diagnosing plant pest symptoms and diseases. The study concluded that plant clinic framework was important and should be considered and adopted by policy makers within the government, research institutes, and other NGOs.

T1  - Exploring farmers’ adaptation strategies to water shortage under climate change in the Tunisian semi-arid region
AN  - 2770549124
AB  - This study explores the adaptation strategies to water shortage at the farm level in the Tunisian semi-arid region and investigates factors determining the farmers’ behavior. In this area, climate change exacerbates the scarcity of water resources, groundwater suffers from saline intrusion, and the reinforcement of surface water depends on the water transfer decision. Based on 81 farmers survey data collected in Diar El Hajjaj irrigated area, the typology of farmers was constructed using the multivariate technique combining the clustering method and principal component analysis.The results show that two groups of the surveyed farmers use more intensive water resources to grow high-value crops and operate toward a commercial farming system. They set up either an accommodating or an expansive plan. The remaining sampled farmers are smallholder farmers who endure critical resource constraints. They tend to adopt a contractive strategy and face a real risk of farming abandonment. Additional actions should be taken at the farm level as well at the national policy level to preserve the farming system under water scarcity due to climate change effects.

T1  - Can cooperatives help commercial farms to access credit in China? Evidence from Jiangsu Province
AN  - 2740169846
AB  - Chinese agriculture is experiencing a transition from smallholder farming to the emergence of commercial farms that are characterized by intensification and specialization in production, as well as commercialization and cooperation in management. It requires substantial capital to facilitate such a transition, but it is very difficult for farmers in China to access bank credit. One way that commercial farms have to overcome such handicap is by organizing themselves into cooperatives. To assess the effect of cooperatives on the credit accessibility of commercial farms, we have developed a theoretical model as well as an empirical study of commercial farms in Jiangsu Province based on data from a survey of 754 commercial farm owners. Instrumental variable (IV) methods and the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method that control endogeneity problem are used in the analysis. The empirical results show that cooperatives have a significant positive impact on the credit access of commercial farms. Commercial farms participating in cooperatives may alleviated their credit constraints by about 17.3 percentage points and increase the average credit per capita by nearly 80,000 Yuan. Cooperatives improve the credit access of commercial farms by exerting strong market power and reputation effect based on its organizational advantages. A disaggregated analysis also reveals that small commercial farms tend to benefit more from cooperatives in improving credit access than large commercial farms.Alternate abstract:RésuméL'agriculture chinoise connaît une transition de l'agriculture paysanne à l'émergence d'exploitations commerciales qui se caractérisent par l'intensification et la spécialisation de la production, ainsi que la commercialisation et la coopération dans la gestion. Il faut des capitaux importants pour faciliter une telle transition, mais il est très difficile pour les agriculteurs chinois d'accéder au crédit bancaire. L'une des façons dont les exploitations agricoles commerciales doivent surmonter ce handicap est de s'organiser en coopératives. Pour évaluer l'effet des coopératives sur l'accessibilité au crédit des fermes commerciales, nous avons développé un modèle théorique ainsi qu'une étude empirique des fermes commerciales dans la province du Jiangsu basée sur les données d'une enquête auprès de 754 propriétaires de fermes commerciales. Les méthodes des variables instrumentales et la méthode ACP qui contrôlent le problème d'endogénéité sont utilisées dans l'analyse. Les résultats empiriques montrent que les coopératives ont un impact positif significatif sur l'accès au crédit des exploitations commerciales. Les fermes commerciales participant aux coopératives peuvent alléger leurs contraintes de crédit d'environ 17,3 points de pourcentage et augmenter le crédit moyen par habitant de près de 80 000 yuans. Les coopératives améliorent l'accès au crédit des exploitations agricoles commerciales en exerçant un fort pouvoir de marché et un effet de réputation basé sur ses avantages organisationnels. Une analyse désagrégée révèle également que les petites exploitations commerciales ont tendance à bénéficier davantage des coopératives pour améliorer l'accès au crédit que les grandes exploitations commerciales.

T1  - Study on categorization of factors affecting smallholder dairy production in Siltie Zone, Southern Ethiopia, applying multivariate analysis approaches
AN  - 2725455338
AB  - This study aims to categorize smallholder dairy farming systems through multivariate analysis. Nonlinear categorical principal component analysis (NLPCA) was used to lessen 35 variables into 4 sets of uncorrelated components. These four categories are environment-genetic interaction, management, hygiene, and genetic-related factors. Besides, within the two-step cluster analysis, a variable cluster membership was created that identified which family belonged to which cluster. For comparison purpose, hierarchical cluster analysis was used. A two-step cluster analysis results showed that most farms (41.50% and 31.90% in peri-urban and urban areas, respectively, had been in cluster 1 at the same time as most farms (66.70%) of urban areas had been in cluster 2. Overall, most (31.00% and 34.00%) of farms have been in clusters 1 and 2, respectively. Most farms in peri-urban areas had been challenged with scarcity of feed, mastitis, and animal sickness than farms within the urban and rural farming systems. Forming farmer groups as a cooperative to supply offerings together with feed processing devices, artificial insemination, and health services is usually recommended to triumph over such hassle. In addition, on account that it is primarily based on a couple of criteria, the category system evolved in this study depicts a lot better dairy farming systems with admiration to the variety of the components and the relative contribution of each component to dairy farming than do the single-criterion classifications. Hence, the results of such classifications should be seen as a start line from which to efficiently compare the modern extension system and eventually design the high-quality-fit extension models for a heterogeneous populace of smallholder dairy farmers.

T1  - Partial credit guarantee and financial additionality for smallholders coffee cooperatives: experience from Ethiopia
AN  - 2728793604
AB  - This study examined the effects of a partial credit guarantee in increasing lending to credit constrained farmer cooperatives under the Ethiopian context. The data were generated through questionnaire survey, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and from banks’ and cooperatives’ records. The scheme improved financial additionality among the targeted cooperatives, but it had limited reach and impacts on terms and conditions of loans. Factors related to borrower cooperatives, lending banks, scheme design and operation, regulatory and business environments affect its effectiveness. This calls for broader interventions that enable loan guarantees to be effectively utilised and generate the desired outcomes.

T1  - Effects of local farm management on wild bees through temporal and spatial spillovers: evidence from Southern India
AN  - 2724079684
AB  - ContextThe agricultural landscape in many low- and middle-income countries is characterized by smallholder management systems, often dependent on ecosystem services, such as pollination by wild pollinator populations. Increased adoption of modern inputs (e.g., agrochemicals) may threaten pollinators and smallholder crop production.ObjectiveWe aimed to identify the link between the use of agrochemicals and wild bee populations in Southern India, while explicitly considering the effects of temporal and spatial scaling.MethodsFor our empirical analysis, we combined data from pan trap samples and a farm management survey of 127 agricultural plots around Bangalore, India. We implemented a Poisson generalized linear model to analyze factors that influence bee abundance and richness with a particular focus on the present, past, and neighboring management decisions of farmers with respect to chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation.ResultsOur results suggest that agricultural intensification is associated with a decrease in the abundance and richness of wild bees in our study areas. Both time and space play an important role in explaining farm-bee interactions. We find statistically significant negative spillovers from pesticide use. Smallholders’ use of chemical fertilizers and irrigation on their own plots significantly decreases the abundance of bees. Intensive past management reduces both bee abundance and richness.ConclusionsOur results suggest that cooperative behavior among farmers and/or the regulation of agrochemical use is crucial to moderate spatial spillovers of farm management decisions. Furthermore, a rotation of extensive and intensive management could mitigate negative effects.

T1  - A feminist political ecology of farm resource entitlements in Northern Ghana
AN  - 2713870281
AB  - With the unprecedented feminization of agriculture globally, literature has emerged over the past decade suggesting that gender equality in agriculture could be advanced if gaps in access to farm resources between women and men are reduced. This paper examines gendered farm resource entitlements in northern Ghana. Based mainly on six months of immersive qualitative research, this case study draws from and contributes to feminist political ecology scholarship (FPE) on smallholder farming and agricultural development. The analysis describes some of the intensifying gender and intersecting inequalities (e.g., gender and ethnicity) of land access related to development interventions aimed at commercializing farming. Gender disparities in access to agricultural extension, chemical fertilizers, agrochemicals, high yielding seed varieties, tractor services, credit packages and marketing contracts supported by the state, donors and NGOs are also found. FPE is useful for revealing how these gendered resource disparities are related to agricultural commercialization and increasingly erratic rainfall and aridity, making smallholders more vulnerable to land dispossession. Women’s dependence on men to farm while operating under these changing economic and environmental conditions, coupled with their weaker entitlement rights to resources, threatens to push many, particularly ethnic minority women, out of farming altogether. The ways that intersecting identities shape access to land also complicates understandings of the role of community outsiders who are both the dispossessors of land and those who are intensely vulnerable to dispossession. While rural development studies generally consider women’s farm resources compared to men’s, this does little to explain the intensifying intersectional vulnerabilities.

T1  - Factors affecting the adoption of collective pressurized irrigation systems
AN  - 2713853343
AB  - The collective pressurized irrigation system (CPIS), by definition, is expressed as a process of implementing unified pressurized irrigation systems on adjacent lands along with the participation of smallholders and the government and utilizing a public well on integrated lands. This study investigates the factors that affect the tendency to adopt CPIS in Takestan County of Qazvin Province (Iran) over the years 2016–2017. The statistical population of this study includes farmers who use groundwater for irrigation in Takestan County (N = 1740). Of these farmers, 210 were selected as the sample size using Cochran formula, Chi-square, Phi and Cramer's V, and Lambda tests that were used to investigate the relationship between the proposed irrigation system adoption and different dependent variables. Seven research hypotheses were proposed and tested. Since there is a positive and significant relationship between all social communication features and the adoption of CPIS, it is, therefore, recommended that city officials provide more promotional/educational classes and necessary facilities to increase farmers’ acquaintance with new irrigation methods and raise their awareness about the benefits of such a participation in these schemes and programs. In doing so, there is a higher chance that farmers would cooperate to a greater degree in water management.

T1  - Evaluating profitability of beef cattle farming and its determinants among smallholder beef cattle farmers in the Baljovan District of Khatlon region, Tajikistan
AN  - 2714022942
AB  - In Tajikistan, owning beef cattle is an important survival mechanism for smallholder farmers to alleviate poverty. Therefore, beef cattle farming enterprises should indeed strive to maximize profit to excel and flourish in a free economy. Nevertheless, smallholder beef cattle farmers are known for making little profit. Thus, this study was set to evaluate the profitability of beef cattle farming and its determinants to enhance profit maximization among smallholder beef cattle farmers in the Baljovan District of Khatlon region, Tajikistan. A total of 388 farming households were chosen at random and purposive for the study. The cross-sectional data collected using questionnaires was analyzed by using descriptive, gross margin (GM), and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models. Based on the descriptive analyses, the mean age of beef cattle farmers was 52.73 years, with a household size of 7.07 members. The beef cattle farmers had an average of 18.23 cattle herd size with 8.54 years of farming experience. The average land area possessed by farmers was 10.59 hectares. Among farmers, men (98.2%) dominated beef cattle farming activities. Around 83.8% of farmers had a college grade (higher literacy). Besides, around 89.4% of farmers had access to farm credits. However, only 71.4% of farmers used farm credit points to produce beef cattle. Most of the farmers (89.7%) had access to accurate market information. Such market information enabled 75.8% of farmers to sell their beef cattle to open market (profitable) outlets rather than middlemen. About 89.4% had access to veterinary services. Additionally, about 82.7% of farmers acknowledged the availability of pasture for grazing, which motivated 87.6% of farmers to be involved in selling contracts. Furthermore, economic investigation results revealed that on average, farmers had a gross margin (GM-profit) of 353.77 US$ per cattle, with feed costs (58.6%) and medications costs (26.1%) accounting for the largest share of total variable costs. Meanwhile, the profitability of beef cattle farming among farmers was significantly influenced by education level, family size, farming experience, pasture availability, land size owned, selling contract, feed costs, medications expenses, access to credits, and sales costs (P < 0.05). This study concluded that beef cattle production is a feasible business. However, the potential for increased profitability is significant if existing resources are efficiently coordinated and production expenses, notably feed and healthcare costs, are minimized. Thus, the government should develop additional measures for addressing concerns such as capacity building, suitable and freely available pasture as well as health management, to boost beef cattle profitability among farmers in Tajikistan.

T1  - Operations, risk, and small firms: Field results from irrigation equipment vendors in Senegal
AN  - 2709864708
AB  - What are supply chain management challenges in a lower‐income economy, and how do managers at smaller firms address them? This field study presents these challenges from the perspective of the 60 managers who run firms selling irrigation equipment in Senegal. By canvasing 35 cities, we gain unique visibility into how private supply chains, on which public officials and smallholder farmers in Africa rely, effectively deliver agricultural goods. The primary challenges for managers in this supply chain are day‐to‐day risks that are quality and contractual in nature and have financial implications. City size in combination with supplier type, firm size, and manager network determine risk exposure. Firms’ efforts to manage the chain are more reactive than proactive and more informal than formal, which reveals an opportunity for public agencies to support supplier and customer coordination. Public decision makers should tailor support to account for the differential risks that city size brings to supply chain management. This support should include not just financing the firms directly but should also entail giving loans to customers, certifying suppliers, and sharing inventory risk with public and nonprofit partners.

T1  - Strengths and weaknesses of organized crop seed production by smallholder farmers: A five-country case study
AN  - 2701455808
AB  - In many countries, smallholder farmers play a key role in food crop seed production. So far, the community roles, operational structures, seed production efficiency, aspects of sustainability, and the social and policy environments in which these groups operate have been poorly studied and described. The present study attempts to better understand these factors by drawing cases from twenty-five seed producer groups in five countries (Vietnam, Uganda, Zambia, Niger, and Guatemala) that deal with nine crops in total (rice, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, common bean, cowpea, soybean, groundnut, potato and sweet potato). Results of the study show all groups supply a significant share of seed offered in local markets. It appeared that all groups received major support for capacity development from a broad range of actors including local and national governments, public institutions, national seed companies and development organizations. Several groups operate under seasonal contracts with institutional seed buyers, whereas other groups sell most of their seed in local markets to fellow farmers. To support seed quality and render product branding meaningful, most groups have established subgroups for crop monitoring and seed inspection, and for gathering and using market intelligence. Some, but not all groups depend on formal seed certification. Two key challenges stand out across seed producer groups interviewed. First, most seed producer groups experience difficulties in accessing good-quality early generation seed (EGS) on time, like in the formal seed sector in many countries. Second, in most groups packaging and labelling of the seed produced and offered in local markets is suboptimal, hindering further professionalization. Moreover, groups invariably have a poor understanding of applicable seed policy and legislation. Our observations point at actions that external stakeholders could undertake to strengthen smallholder farmer seed production in recognition of their contribution to food and nutrition security.

T1  - Insights into smallholder capacity for agricultural commercialisation: Evidence from four African contexts
AN  - 2723294695
AB  - Over the last 15 years, the agricultural economics and development literature has amply highlighted success stories of smallholder farmers in developing countries, illustrating their increased engagement and integration with markets, in other words, higher rates of commercialisation. Yet, this seeming ‘success’ should not detract from the large proportion of farmers who, through engaging in high-value market chains, face high risks that often limit the extent of their engagement. This study, across four African contexts in Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, strives to better understand smallholder participation in agricultural commercialisation. Using new detailed cross-sectional household-level data, from the Agricultural Policy Research in Africa (APRA) consortium, collected over 2017–2018, we analyse assets as a determining factor for localised patterns smallholder commercialisation. Applying asset-based thresholds, we capture commercialisation ‘capacity’—an indicator of the household’s commercialisation potential and ability to respond to risks. Despite the possibility to increase commercialisation as well as institutional arrangements that may reduce risk, such as contract farming, benefits from linkages with medium-scale farmers or returns from specific crop types, we find that households may yet be constrained by lower capacity. Hence, the need for targeted support for those at the margins and with limited assets; with the most pronounced and significant constraints for lower capacity households in study areas in Tanzania. These results can better inform development policies for agriculture where it is important to be able to specifically target households rather than a one size fits all approach.

T1  - Patterns of Engagement for Smallholder Farmers in Accessing Government Markets in South Africa
AN  - 2696337020
AB  - The South African Government’s drive to empower smallholder farmers through preferentially facilitated access to procurement opportunities should be concomitantly matched with the smallholder capacity to deliver. However, there has been little information from the literature to examine the smallholder farmers’ predisposition toward aggregation or whether they would prefer to remain independent from any form of organization to enhance their capacity. The study was undertaken, based on a simple random selection of the smallholder farmers in the district of Thabo Mofutsanyane. The results indicate that despite the perceived benefits of belonging to a group, about half of the smallholder farmers would prefer to remain independent from any form of aggregation or farmer group. The results are an antithesis to the common literature opinion on farmer grouping or aggregation. On the other hand, it may be that smallholder farmers would subscribe to coming together for collective benefit, but currently, do not have a formal governance structure or group account. The results provide an alert that while the government considers group operations such as cooperatives as a potential mechanism to deepen empowerment, it remains a challenge to properly entrench such notion for collective group operations beyond the means of the smallholder farmers to access resources.

T1  - Analysis of resource use efficiency for white cumin production among smallholder farmers empirical evidence from Northwestern Ethiopia: a stochastic frontier approach
AN  - 2694818800
AB  - Cumin is a flowering plant and the second Ethiopian export spice crop next to ginger. The area coverage, as well as the production of white cumin, is increasing year to year. However, there is a growing gap between white cumin demand and supply in Ethiopia due to its low production and productivity of white cumin. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate factors affecting the technical inefficiency of white cumin production among smallholder producers in Northwestern Ethiopia. A Semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect the primary data from 228 white cumin producers, who were selected by using a systematic random sampling technique. Moreover, a combination of data analysis methods such as descriptive statistics and the stochastic Cobb–Douglas production frontier model was used to analyze the collected data. The empirical result of the study showed that the mean technical efficiency of white cumin production was 81%. This implies that white cumin producers can boost white cumin output by 19% using the existing level of inputs and technology. The maximum likelihood estimates of the stochastic production model revealed that land, Nitrogen-Phosphate and Sulphate, and urea were statistically and positively affected the production level of white cumin. The positive effect indicates that the lack of these inputs would hamper the production of white cumin. Moreover, the maximum likelihood estimate of the stochastic frontier model coupled with the inefficiency parameters indicated that the age of household head, tropical livestock unit, land fragmentation, and membership of cooperatives were found to be statistically and negatively influence the level of technical inefficiency of white cumin producers, whereas family size, distance to the main road and credit access were found to be statistically and positively influence the level of technical inefficiency of white cumin producers. Hence, the study suggested that the government should strengthen farm cooperatives and construct roads near the residence of producers to improve their efficiency level. Moreover, the district experts should arrange an experience-sharing (which is a proxy variable for age) program to improve the efficiency level of less efficient producers by adopting the best practice of relatively efficient producers.

T1  - Adoption factors and structural characteristics of irrigated olive grove agroforestry systems in Central Tunisia
AN  - 2688951250
AB  - Irrigated olive grove agroforestry systems in the Southern Mediterranean have rarely been studied. In the context of increased interest for agroecological approaches, this study questions why and how farmers undertake such associations, in the case of smallholder irrigated agriculture in Tunisia. The objectives were to characterize the physical structure of existing olive-summer vegetable associations and describe the rationales of farmers implementing them. Quantitative and qualitative approaches were used to collect data from 132 olive groves and 31 semi-directive interviews in the Merguellil plain, Central Tunisia. Dual crop input-intensive agroforestry systems were predominant, although agroforestry structures with a high species’ diversity also existed. Adoption reasons and implementation of agroforestry systems varied. The latter were often perceived as an economically viable solution in a context of difficult access to productive resources. Particularly, limited and fragmented access to land or water was a strong driver of adoption, inducing contractual arrangements between farmers to share resources. Farmers implemented agroforestry systems mainly to maximize income, reduce production costs or reduce risks through a crop diversification strategy. Most characterized agroforestry olive-summer vegetable associations may fail to meet the principles of agroecology. Being already adopted by farmers, they may however serve as a base to conceive improved cropping systems.

T1  - Does a joint United Nations microfinance 'plus' program empower female farmers in rural Ethiopia? Evidence using the pro-WEAI
AN  - 2681086988
AB  - Microfinance is thought to be an effective tool for empowering women. Yet, previous studies that evaluate microfinance programs have mixed findings. This is in part because there are large variations in the interventions that are evaluated, but also that there is not a standardized metric of empowerment that is implemented consistently throughout the literature. This study investigates the effectiveness of a joint United Nations program aimed at empowering rural women through women-run rural savings and credit cooperatives in Oromia, Ethiopia, using the project-Women's Empowerment in Agricultural Index. Building on more than a decade of studies and validation of different versions of the Women's Empowerment in Agricultural Index, the tool aims to provide a standardized and comparable metric of women's empowerment that is flexible enough to measure impacts of development projects. This study finds that the program had a positive impact on intrinsic agency for the beneficiaries with continued access to credit through the RUSACCOs between the baseline and endline. For this group of beneficiaries, the program seemed to increase the trust and respect between spouses. There is a second group of beneficiaries that appeared to have dropped out at the initial stages of the program or lost access to credit, suggesting there may have been problems with the program or possible resistance by spouses or community members. The study expands our understanding of how to measure women's empowerment impacts of development projects within the context of a smallholder agricultural households.

T1  - EXISTENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY OF SHARECROPPING CONTRACT IN BALI PROVINCE, INDONESIA
AN  - 2726072879
AB  - In agriculture in Bali, there are still many unwritten agricultural contracts that are very traditional in the form of sharecropping contracts. The traditional sharecropping contract regulates the sharing of results and also costs between the landowner and tenant. The purpose of this study is to identify and analyze key factors related to the existence and sustainability of sharecropping contracts in Bali Province. This study uses a prospective analysis-MICMAC, where data were previously collected through FGDs involving experts or stakeholders who are considered to be familiar with sharecropping contracts in Bali. Based on the identification results, it is known that there are eight key factors or variables in the sharing contract in Bali. The variables included as key drivers are risk as well as productivity and soil quality, while reputation, norms, types of food crops, and kinship are relay variables. The cost and also financial position and capital are depending variables. While the variables included as key drivers are the dominant factors that have the most influence on sharecropping contracts in Bali are social norms and reputation. Meanwhile, the dominant factors that are most dependent are costs as well as financial position and capital.

T1  - Are Collective Trading Organisations Necessarily Inclusive of Smallholder Farmers?: A Comparative Analysis of Farmer-led Auctions in the Javanese Chilli Market
AN  - 2718749720
AB  - Organising smallholder farmers into groups or co-operatives is widely promoted as a strategy to connect farmers to markets and turn them into price makers rather than price takers. This pathway usually combines co-operative organisational models, based on collective ownership and representation in internal governance, with measures to shorten the agri-food chain, shifting the ownership of intermediary sourcing, aggregating and trading functions to the group. The underlying assumption is that this improves smallholder farmers' terms of inclusion in markets. To scrutinise this assumption, our study compares two examples of farmer-led auctions facilitating trading in the chilli market in Java, Indonesia. The auctions' ownership, management and performance evolved differently: one was run by a group and the other by a family. The comparison brings nuance to the prevalent emphasis on co-operative ownership structures. By researching practices central to collective trading at the chilli supplier–trader interface, this study unravels four dimensions—ownership, voice, reward and risk—capturing smallholder chilli farmers' terms of inclusion in both the auctions and the market. Our comparative analysis suggests that shared ownership and control of the trading function, a central feature of co-operative models, does not necessarily ensure favourable terms of inclusion for smallholder farmers with little capacity to take risks. The capacity to reconfigure the terms of market inclusion for vulnerable smallholder farmers involves direct payment modalities and risk taking. A collectively owned trading organisation does not necessarily imply an inclusive business concept when the organisation cannot acquire sufficient working capital to pay its suppliers.

T1  - The design of blockchain network of palm oil FFB supply from certified farms and traceability system of CPO from independent smallholders
AN  - 2675242242
AB  - Mills produce Crude Palm Oil (CPO) from procurement channels of their plantation, plasma farm, and independent smallholders’ farm. The mill manufactures Fruit Fresh Bunch FFB from all channels and sells CPO with low Free Fatty Acid (FFA) CPO for foods and CPO for industrial. CPO with low FFA for export consists of premium-grade CPO with FFA level < 2% and super-grade CPO with FFA level <3.5%. This Low FFA CPO is exported for food to developed countries. The food industry as a CPO customer needs a lot of information about the origin of the CPO commodity and information about sustainable oil palm agriculture governance. The challenges of building low FFA CPO traceability system raw material of CPO come from three-channel of FFB procurement and produce the various quality of CPO. This study aims to map the FFB supply at PT. RSI from Roundtable on Sustainability Palm Oil (RSPO) certificate farm in independent smallholders groups channel in the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network and smart contract. The interaction of entities with smart contracts is described in the ERD diagram, and the form of collaboration between entities is illustrated in the sequence diagram. The design of blockchain network of FFB supply and traceability of FFB from independent smallholders group procurement channel was based on CPO sales data from the exporter. The contribution of independent smallholders group channels to produce low FFA CPO was calculated. By presenting the CPO supply system on a map, independent smallholders’ farms’ source of low FFA CPO can be identified. Finally, various sustainable information in the farms can be shared.

T1  - Perishability and market power in Nepalese food crop production
AN  - 2674229249
AB  - This study provides empirical evidence for the relation between perishability in vertically coordinated supply chains and the market power exercised over smallholders in Nepal. Using survey data from small‐scale farms of tomatoes, ginger, high‐yielding variety paddy seeds, and lentils, we demonstrate how varying levels of perishability affect the degree of market power exercised by contractors and in cooperative farming. We show how much value‐added is diverted from farmers, compared to the benchmark set by the least perishable good. Results indicate that more perishable crops are subject to a greater degree of market power. A subsequent scenario analysis reveals that the redistributive effects of market power based on crop perishability are substantial: smallholders’ farm profitability increase by 18% as crop perishability is reduced by 50%. We conclude by discussing policy measures to reduce power imbalances due to crop perishability.

T1  - Tobacco Farming Following Land Reform in Zimbabwe: A New Dynamic of Social Differentiation and Accumulation
AN  - 2696370228
AB  - Tobacco has been central to the agrarian economy of Zimbabwe since the early 1900s, when it became the backbone of the new settler economy following colonisation. Since the land reform of 2000, tobacco has taken on a new impetus, with production now often exceeding that generated by white commercial farming in the 1990s. Today, tobacco is being produced predominantly by smallholders, with those on resettlement land being especially important. Tobacco production is supported by a range of buying companies, auction houses, transporters and contract arrangements, and small-scale farmers are thus tightly connected to a global commodity chain. This article explores tobacco production in A1 (smallholder) resettlement schemes in Mvurwi area, Mazowe district, a high-potential area to the north of Harare. The article is based on a combination of surveys and in-depth interviews with farmers carried out between 2017 and 2019. The article explores who are the winners and losers in the changing dynamics of smallholder tobacco production in these land reform sites and how different groups of farmers combine tobacco with other crops and with off-farm enterprises. Drawing on a simple typology of producers derived from the analysis of survey data from 310 A1 farmers, we examine the role of tobacco in complex patterns of accumulation and social differentiation, looking at class, gender and age dynamics. The conclusion discusses how the tobacco boom is reshaping the agrarian economy and its underlying social relations. This is a highly dynamic setting, influenced by how tobacco production is incorporated into farming systems, how its production is financed, how and where it is marketed and how it is combined with other crops and other income-earning opportunities.

T1  - Tobacco Farmers and Their Communities: Interlinkages, Gains and Losses in Mazowe, Zimbabwe
AN  - 2696370215
AB  - This article investigates spillover effects from the interlinked transactions arising from smallholder tobacco farmers’ participation in contract farming arrangements in the Mazowe district of Mashonaland Central. The case study is based on data from a household survey conducted in the district and includes both tobacco farmers and households that do not produce tobacco. Interviews, participant observation and a review of statistical data and grey literature helped trace dynamics of production, intra-household relations and changing communal relations. The study explores how social relations and power imbalances shape the distribution of benefits, costs and losses resulting from the adoption of contract farming in the production of tobacco. The paper argues that the adoption of contract farming leads to a range of interlinked transactional outcomes, such as the diversification of agricultural production and new investments into non-farm activities by the poorer members of the community. In turn, these interlinked transactions generate jobs and increase food consumption and effective demand for services at the community level. However, it is also the case that the gains from these interlinked transactions are highly skewed against the poorer people in the district and that wealthier and better-connected farmers gain more from adopting tobacco than their less wealthy and less well-connected peers. This could lead to increased inequality in the community. The paper shows how agricultural dynamism generates spillover and multiplier effects that benefit communities in an unequal and poorly understood manner.

T1  - In‐kind credit provision through contract farming and formal credit markets
AN  - 2646154032
AB  - Access to credit is a key prerequisite for the development of smallholder agriculture. However, rural credit markets are typically characterized by market failures and smallholder credit access is limited. Resource‐providing contracts are an institutional tool to overcome credit market failures through the provision of production inputs in the form of in‐kind credit. Previous research has shown that interlinkage of contract and credit helps farmers overcome financial constraints, foster production investments, and hence increase productivities and income. However, if and how such contract schemes affect farmers' overall demand for and access to formal credit from other sources is not yet well understood. In this article, we therefore investigate the associations of the provision of in‐kind credit and farming households' formal credit demand and ability to receive formal credit. We use data of 463 oil palm producers in Ghana and show that participation in contract farming is associated with an increase in credit demand. Concerning credit approval, we find that the outstanding debt of the in‐kind credit scheme is associated with a substantially lower likelihood of credit acceptance. However, the results also suggest that farmers can fully compensate this negative effect by informing the bank about the contract, and thus the source of the debt. This indicates that debt acquired from resource‐providing contract schemes does not necessarily pose an additional credit constraint to farmers. [EconLit Citation G21, G23, O16, O17].

T1  - Land tenure security and farm efficiency in Indian agriculture: Revisiting an old debate
AN  - 2664075743
AB  - This paper examines the Marshallian inefficiency hypothesis of share tenancy system in agriculture of Odisha, Eastern India. It examines the hypothesis from a different perspective where it is argued that a secured land tenure system enhances farm efficiency even though it is sharecropping. We develop three hypotheses within the profit maximization framework and use the efficiency scores of paddy growers computed from the data envelop analysis (DEA) to verify them empirically. The 'latent variable regression model' results reveal that a secured land ownership status significantly augments farm efficiency. But the nature of tenancy contract (sharecropping and fixed-rent tenancy) makes no difference in farm efficiency. The policy implication of the study calls for tenancy reform in Odisha agriculture to make the tenancy a more secure one. Currently, the government of Odisha has banned the share tenancy. But a vast concealed tenancy comprising of marginal farmers and landless cultivators is in place. So any reform in this regard would benefit them directly.

T1  - Toward a feminist political ecology of household food and water security during drought in northern Nicaragua
AN  - 2648263689
AB  - Few studies assess the relationship between food and water access, despite global concerns about people's inability to maintain access to both food and water. We conducted a mixed-methods comparative case study in northern Nicaragua, with smallholders from two neighboring communities that differed in water availability and institutional strength, using a feminist political ecology framework and food and water security definitions that focus on access, availability, use, and stability. We adopted a participatory approach that included: a sex-disaggregated survey in 2016; interviews, participant observation, and community-based water quality testing from 2014 to 2019; and analysis of a severe drought that occurred from 2014 to 2017. Our results suggest that uneven power relations, biophysical conditions, gender, and institutions shape food and water access, and indicate that households across both communities average 2 months of drinking water insecurity during the dry season followed by an average of 2.5 months of food insecurity early in the growing season. The average duration of lean food months was similar across communities and sex, but water insecurity lasted longer in the community that had weaker local institutions and less surface water availability. Ethnographic research helped to document uneven and gendered experiences of water access and to illustrate how they were also shaped by conflicts over water for irrigation vs. domestic uses and cross-scalar limitations in water and land governance. Although we found that gender and institutions were not strong predictors of several food and water insecurity indicators on their own, both factors influenced the terms of access, conflict, and cooperative governance needed to secure resources and well-being. Our study highlights the need for theory, methods, and field research that integrate the analysis of food and water security, and it contributes to developing a feminist political ecology approach that unifies this analysis with a focus on gender.

T1  - What is the influence of government programs on farmer organizations and their impacts? Evidence from Zambia: Annales de l'economie Collective
AN  - 2628273423
AB  - Governments and donors often promote farmer organizations (FOs) in the implementation of their agricultural development programs. Yet, there is a lot of uncertainty whether externally supported FOs provide benefits beyond the channelling of programs. This paper uses Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and representative data from 4,074 Zambian households to estimate FO impacts on members, with and without controlling for a national input‐subsidy program. The results show that Zambian FOs tend to attract better‐educated households with larger farm sizes, but can lead to female integration when external subsidies are involved. FOs also have a significantly positive effect on members’ farm performance, irrespective of whether members receive input subsidies, while the presence of the external program leads to an unequal distribution of benefits within the FOs: positive impacts on farm performance are, on average 13–44% lower amongst members who do not benefit from the Zambian government program. Overall, these findings imply that Zambian FOs seem to provide benefits that go beyond the intention of the subsidy‐program, which can be used to promote women empowerment and smallholder farm performance. The findings also demonstrate, however, that governments need to carefully design their programs to not reinforce inequality amongst farmer organizations and their members.

T1  - Factors Influencing Smallholder Rice Farmers’ Vulnerability to Climate Change and Variability in the Mekong Delta Region of Vietnam
AN  - 2621821051
AB  - This study analyzed the effects of climate change on rice farmers’ livelihoods vulnerability by using primary data elicited from 405 rice farming households in Can Tho, Dong Thap, and Tien Giang provinces in the Mekong Delta Region (MDR) of Vietnam. The Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) showed that Can Tho province was the most vulnerable to climate change, followed by Dong Thap and Tien Giang provinces. In particular, the social index sub-indicator showed high vulnerability. The beta regression analysis identified seventeen significant factors influencing the susceptibility of rice farming households in the study area, such as weather information, flood occurrence, drought occurrence, access to extension services, access to credit, and cooperative membership as well as demographic variables and livelihoods related factors. The LVI result suggests the need for the government to consider raising the priority on households in Can Tho province through adaptation support to improve the resilience and adaptive capacity, especially by enhancing the social network in this area to stimulate support from local authorities and farmer groups. The regression results imply that extension services should provide adequate and timely weather information to equip the farmers to be more prepared for climatic shocks. Moreover, credit facilities with low interest rates should be made available, especially to those who are members of agricultural cooperatives.

T1  - Adoption of Tef (<i>Eragrostis Tef</i>) Production Technology Packages in Northwest Ethiopia
AN  - 2770810377
AB  - Adoption of Tef production technology has paramount importance to increase Tef productivity, foster food security, and secure the well-being of smallholder farmers. Hence, this study aims to identify the determinants of adoption of Tef technology packages in Yilmana Densa district, and subsequently assess the factors influencing the intensity of adoption of the technology. In this study, 224 sample households were selected using systematic random sampling techniques. The data were obtained mainly from sampled Tef grower households via structured interviews, and it was supported by key informant interviews. Descriptive statistics such as Chi-square, t-test, and one-way ANOVA were employed. First-hurdle of double hurdle model result revealed that adoption decision of Tef technology packages was determined via the frequency of extension contact, agricultural training, farmers’ perception, and farmers’ cooperative membership, positively. The second-hurdle result also shown that the adoption intensity of Tef technology packages was influenced by the frequency of extension contact, agricultural training, demonstration participation, and seed multiplication membership, positively, whereas the distance to input market and land fragmentation influenced negatively. Therefore, efforts to be expected from the Ministry of Agriculture, extension agents, and other stockholders to enhance the adoption level of farmers.

T1  - Seasonality and food security among smallholder rural households in eastern Ethiopia: Evidence from panel data analysis
AN  - 2770809579
AB  - Food insecurity remains one of the major challenges in Ethiopia. There is scanty empirical evidence regarding the contribution of seasonality to household food and nutrition security. This study was conducted in eastern Ethiopia with the aim of examining seasonal household food and nutrition security and factors influencing this seasonal variation. Data were gathered from randomly selected households during pre- and post-harvest seasons. A Random Effects Generalized Least Squares (GLS) regression was employed for analysis. The result indicated considerable variation between the two seasons in terms of dietary diversity and food security. Households producing more food groups, cultivating larger size of land, having higher household income, keeping more livestock, owning cell phone, having access to cooperatives, and having access to improved drinking water as well as education were more likely to be more food secure across seasons. However, households keeping livestock in their dwelling units and households who had access to credit were negatively associated with seasonal food insecurity. Future interventions aiming at ensuring food security should pay attention to seasonality and mechanisms of improving diversified food production and household income as well as expanding education opportunities and access to cooperatives, infrastructure (mobile telephone), and sanitation.

T1  - Farm households’ perception about sugarcane outgrowers’ scheme: Empirical evidence around Wonji/Shoa Sugar Factory
AN  - 2770809508
AB  - The study assessed the perception of contract farm households about sugarcane outgrowers’ scheme around the Wonji/Shoa sugar factory. The study utilized primary data collected from randomly selected samples of 200 members of sugarcane-producing farmers’ cooperatives through a structured survey questionnaire. Purposively selected ten KIIs and six FGDs were also conducted with contract farmers and stakeholders. The five-point Likert scale measurement was created and applied to measure the perception of respondents about the scheme on considered 26 attributes and analyzed through descriptive statistics. Results revealed that the overall perception of the respondent contract farm households about the scheme was unfavorable with a weighted mean/index score of ‘2.32ʹ with a mixed perception index score on considered 26 attributes. The study discussed the policy implications of the findings. The main areas of concern are the payment system, the relationship of contract farmers with representatives (from the union, factory, and cooperatives), the income of contract farm households, the provision of services package (like free training, extension services, technical advice), the transparent and comprehensive contract terms and conditions, the provision of basic inputs and production services as per agreement (like adequate land preparation, infield irrigation), the effective and efficient legal framework system, additional support by third parties (on pre and post-harvest, production input provision, basic skill training, and etc.), and both parties should develop trust by having confidence on each other and not by acting opportunistically.

T1  - Antecedents of Livelihood Development Using Cold Chains in the Horticultural Sector of the Emerging Markets: A Systematic Literature Review
AN  - 2756717859
AB  - Diversification into horticulture has become the primary source of livelihood for smallholders. The study analyses trends, theories, settings, constructions, research methods, and findings based on Keynes’ “confidence theory”, the absolute income hypothesis, and the human development index. Using the Theory, Constructs, Characteristics, and Methodology (TCCM) framework, the paper offers a Systematic Literature Review of 67 scholarly research papers with fifty or more citations published between 2000 and 2021 in EBSCO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. The study advocates that a Cold Chain must be considered with the intervention of contract farming, government, cooperative or farmer-producer organisations to reap maximum benefits from horticultural production during the off-and-on seasons rather than selling to opportunistic intermediaries. The study also has important implications for future researchers and policy-makers but, most importantly, offers motivation to the investors for safe investment decisions in the cold chain infrastructure development for higher returns to producers cutting across their geographical, sociological, or economic contexts.

T1  - Will Joining Cooperative Promote Farmers to Replace Chemical Fertilizers with Organic Fertilizers?
AN  - 2756706584
AB  - This study examines whether cooperatives can assist more than 200 million farmers in China, who are facing tightening resources and environmental constraints, in adopting green farming practices. A framework for counterfactual analysis was established to quantify the impact of farmers joining cooperatives on the reduction in chemical fertilizer consumption and the use of organic fertilizers. The study’s conclusions are based on data from 712 farmers in four counties in Shandong and Henan provinces. Joining a cooperative can have a positive impact on farmers’ selection of environmentally friendly production methods, which increases the likelihood of farmers reducing chemical fertilizer application by 35.6% and organic fertilizer application by 22.0%. It can also reduce the cost of chemical fertilizer application by an average of $209.2/ha. The extent to which smallholder farmers use chemical and organic fertilizers after joining cooperatives depends on the size of their farming operations and their perception of green production.

T1  - Using the Women Empowerment in Livestock Index (WELI) to Examine Linkages between Women Smallholder Livestock Farmers’ Empowerment and Access to Livestock Vaccines in Machakos County of Kenya: Insights and Critiques
AN  - 2748435923
AB  - Livestock diseases are a major barrier to productivity for both male and female livestock keepers in Africa. In Kenya, two of the most devastating livestock diseases are Newcastle Disease (ND) in poultry and Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP) in goats. Female livestock keepers tend to own more small ruminants (goats, sheep, etc.) and poultry and their livelihoods are adversely affected if their herds are not vaccinated against these diseases. Livestock farming has gender specific challenges and opportunities, with implications for the empowerment of women smallholder farmers, their household well-being, food security, and livelihoods. There is a need to estimate the level to which women benefit personally, socially, and economically from keeping livestock, yet there are very few studies that can measure if livestock production does in fact empower women smallholder livestock farmers. This study was done to examine linkages between women’s empowerment and access and control over livestock products and vaccines. The Women Empowerment in Livestock Index (WELI) tool, which was customized to include questions on livestock vaccine access, was used to capture baseline data on empowerment scores for women in Machakos county, Kenya, prior to implementation of animal health and vaccine test models. In total, 400 participants were surveyed in two wards of Machakos County, Kola and Kalama, which were purposively selected. Women’s empowerment was mapped to three domains (3DE): intrinsic agency (power within), instrumental agency (power to), and collective agency (power with) measured against adequacy in 13 indicators. Our results indicate that the household structure (female headed or dual headed household), age of respondents and number of members in a household influence the adequacy score. Work balance was the most significant negative contributor to women’s disempowerment. Women contributed the most to livestock productive activities and attained adequacy in this area compared to men, directly impacting the WELI score. Women smallholder livestock farmers report low CCPP and ND vaccination rates, minimal knowledge on livestock diseases, a lack of access to cold chain storage and rarely visited veterinarians. The WELI score was 0.81 indicating a high level of empowerment for women in this community compared to men leading us to conclude that the overall WELI score was not an accurate indicator of women‘s empowerment in Machakos County. However, the decomposability of the index allows us to disaggregate the drivers of change and to examine how individual indicators contribute to disempowerment.

T1  - Securing the Harvest for the Smallholder Farmer in Rwanda: Fragmented or Consolidated Farmland Use?
AN  - 2748319180
AB  - The year 2007 marked the beginning of a journey to secure food in Rwanda. The country introduced the Crop Intensification Program (CIP), which promotes the farmland use consolidation (LUC). This study assesses the effect of farmland use changes on the agriculture production. We collected data at four research sites and considered three agriculture years to assess the effect of the fragmented or consolidated farmland use on the harvest. The study confirms that the CIP/LUC program converted perennial crops, mainly banana plantations, into seasonal crops, which were prioritized by the program. Overall, we conclude that the shift in farmland use has created an increase in both the harvest and monetary yields of the prioritized crops. However, within that general trend, we observe differences: farmers with smaller and/or fewer farm plots did not realize as great a yield increase as those who joined the CIP/LUC program with larger and/or multiple farm plots. While contributing to an understanding of the ongoing agriculture transformation program in Rwanda, this study followed a statistical approach that could be used by new studies assessing the benefits and outcomes of development policies.

T1  - Contract Farming and Technical Efficiency: A Case of Export-Oriented Organic Rice Farmers in Pakistan
AN  - 2748318495
AB  - Although organic rice is a niche market in Pakistan, it has exhibited enormous potential for growth in export-oriented production. Since contract farming is the leading promoter of export-oriented organic rice production in Punjab, Pakistan, improving the technical efficiency of smallholder rice farmers through contract farming holds sufficient potential. This work examines the influence of contract farming participation on smallholder rice farmers’ technical efficiency using a cross-sectional data set of 650 respondents. We applied a stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to examine the production frontier and inefficiency estimates. Further, propensity score matching (PSM) was used to control endogeneity and self-selection bias in technical efficiency estimates. The results reveal that the technical efficiency score of organic rice farmers in Punjab, Pakistan, is 89.7%, which can still be improved by 10.3% at the current sociodemographic characters and input levels. Likewise, land size, seed, and machine expenditures are the key inputs of the production frontier. Results show a positive and significant connection between contract farming participation and technical efficiency. The study extends the literature on technical efficiency, export-oriented production, contract farming, and the well-being of smallholder farmers. Moreover, the study’s findings provide cues for policies and practices.

T1  - Is Contract Farming with Modern Distributors Partnership for Higher Returns? Analysis of Rice Farm Households in Taiwan
AN  - 2739479852
AB  - This study provides empirical evidence of the economic effect of contract farming for the agriculture sector dominated by smallholder farms. In light of the association between contract farming and modern food distribution channels, we categorize the adoption decisions of contract farming and modern marketing channels into four mutually exclusive choices and investigate their economic effects through the simulated maximum likelihood estimation of the multinomial treatment effects model. The results provide empirical evidence supporting higher returns from the dual partnerships as choosing modern distributors generates more revenues for the those participating in contract farming than for those with no contract farming, and contract farming is more likely to help generate more revenues for those who have taken modern distributors as their major marketing channel compared with those relying on traditional channels. Moreover, we examine whether any distributional pattern of marginal economic effects, of either contract farming or modern marketing channel, is present among farmers at various scales by using the conditional and unconditional quantile regression models. Our findings suggest that the marginal treatment effects are generally in an increasing trend as the quantile increases, implying that the economic effects of contract farming or partnership with modern distributors are more pronounced for higher returns among rice farmers in Taiwan. This finding has great policy implications for developing sustainable agriculture and food supply when facing greater uncertainties due to global warming in the future, especially in an agriculture sector with most smallholder farmers.

T1  - Penglibatan dan Produkviti Buruh Tempatan dalam Industri Kelapa Sawit
AN  - 2735561262
AB  - Abstrak: Produktiviti merupakan faktor penting untuk memastikan output yang optimum. Dalam industri kelapa sawit, produktiviti buruh memainkan peranan penting untuk memastikan kelestrarian pengeluaran hasil kelapa sawit mencapai sasaran. Sarawak yang merupakan negeri utama penyumbang industri kelapa sawit di Malaysia terpaksa berhadapan dengan masalah kekurangan tenaga buruh yang serius. Pemberhentian buruh asing disebabkan oleh pandermik Covid 19 menjadikan isu buruh di Sarawak lebih parah. Penglibatan buruh tempatan diharapkan dapat menyelesaikan isu pemberhentian buruh asing. Namun begitu, rata-rata orang tem-patan kurang berminat untuk terlibat dalam sektor pertanian kelapa sawit. Kajian ini bertujuan untuk membin-cangkan penglibatan buruh tempatan dalam pertanian kelapa sawit dan juga strategi untuk meningkatkan produktiviti buruh tempatan. Kajian ini menggunakan kaedah kuantitatatif dan persampelan bertujuan dalam pengutipan data. Seramai 56 orang pekebun kecil kelapa sawit (PKS) yang mempunyai buruh tempatan telah dipilih. Hasil kajian menunjukkan, jenis buruh tempatan adalah ahli keluarga, sanak saudara dan buruh kam-pung. Mereka ini dibayar secara kontrak dan juga mengikut bilangan pokok kelapa sawit. Dari segi strategi untuk meningkatkan produkviti buruh, menggunakan pekerja yang berkemahiran, amalan pertanian baik, modal yang mencukupi, kemahiran menguruskan haiwan perosak dan penyakit tanaman, pengkhususan kerja, kerja berkumpulan serta memberikan ganjaran merupakan antara saranan yang dikemukan oleh PKS. Jika masalah ini tidak ditangani ia akan menjejaskan keseluruhan industri kelapa sawit khususnya di Sarawak me-mandangkan negeri ini merupakan antara penyumbang terbesar kelapa sawit negara. Jika kerajaan negeri dan persekutuan tidak dapat menyelesaikan isu kekurangan buruh dalam industri kelapa sawit, ia akan men-jejaskan seluruh industri kelapa sawit Malaysia.Alternate abstract:Productivity is an essential factor in ensuring optimal output. In the oil palm industry, labour productivity is vital in ensuring that oil palm production reaches its target/production. Sarawak, a significant contributor to the oil palm industry in Malaysia, faces a severe labour shortage. The layoffs of foreign labour due to the Covid 19 pandemics made the labour issue in Sarawak even worse. The involvement of local labour is expected to resolve the decrease in foreign labour. However, local people have minimal interest in getting involved in the oil palm agriculture sector. This study aims to examine the involvement of local labour in oil palm and strategies to increase local labour productivity. This study uses quantitative methods and purposive sampling in data collection. A total of 56 oil palm smallholders (PKS) who have local labour were selected. The results showed the type of local labour are family members, relatives, and village labour. They are paid on a contract basis and according to the number of oil palm trees. In terms of strategies to increase labour productivity, employing skilled workers, good agricultural practices, adequate capital, skills in managing pests and crop diseases, job specialization, group work, and rewards are among the recommendations put forward by PKS. If this problem still occurs, it will affect the entire oil palm industry, especially in Sarawak, as the state is one of its most significant contributors to oil palm. If the local and federal governments cannot resolve labour shortage issue in the oil palm industry, it will affect Malaysia's entire oil palm industry.

T1  - The Effect of Technical Training Provided by Agricultural Cooperatives on Farmers’ Adoption of Organic Fertilizers in China: Based on the Mediation Role of Ability and Perception
AN  - 2734631931
AB  - Organic fertilizers can be crucial in promoting sustainable agricultural development, but they are not used in a wide-ranging way among smallholder farmers in many developing countries. In China, cooperatives are considered essential subjects of agricultural technical training, but it is more common to join cooperatives without participating in their technical training. Thus, joining cooperatives or not cannot simply be used to assess the role of cooperatives in influencing the farmers’ production behavior. Based on survey data of 1160 citrus farmers in Sichuan Province, China, this study estimated the effect of the technical training provided by agricultural cooperatives on farmers’ adoption of organic fertilizers, taking into account the farmers’ ability and perception as the mediation variables. The findings showed that participating in the technical training provided by agricultural cooperatives could significantly enhance the likelihood that farmers will adopt organic fertilizers. The impact was 81.6% in influencing the farmer’s abilities and 7.64% in their perceptions of organic fertilizers. Furthermore, other variables, such as farm sizes, land transfers, and education levels, also make a difference in the effectiveness of the agricultural cooperatives’ technical training. This study provides support for developing pertinent policies to promote the complete adoption of agricultural cooperatives’ technical training functions and the widespread use of organic fertilizers.

T1  - Factors Influencing Rooibos Tea Certification and Quality Control for Smallholder Farmers in South Africa
AN  - 2734625416
AB  - This study aimed to identify factors that influence the decisions of rooibos farmers in South Africa to implement certification and quality assurance systems. The study was conducted in the Western Cape region of South Africa. A structured questionnaire was distributed to 300 farmers in the form of interviews. In addition, an analysis of previously published data was also used. Results showed that membership in an association, land tenure, rooibos tea farm size, and education level were the main determinants of implementing certifications and quality assurance systems. Membership in the association and land tenure significantly negatively affected the adoption of certification. In contrast, farm size and level of education, translating to knowledge of certification systems, tended to have a significant positive effect on adoption. Continuous education, awareness of the process of certification and quality assurance systems, and the formation of farmers’ support systems are recommended to improve the impact of smallholder rooibos farmers in the industry.

T1  - Does Farm Size Expansion Improve the Agricultural Environment? Evidence from Apple Farmers in China
AN  - 2734592516
AB  - Farmland environmental pollution has put greater pressure on the sustainability of agricultural production systems. Exploring the relationship between farm size and environmental pollution in agriculture can help provide realistic guidance for stakeholders. In this study, the research data from apple farmers in China were used to measure the environmental pollutant emissions caused by apple production using the life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The mediating effect model was used to examine the mechanisms and pathways by which farm size affects the environmental effects of apple production and to identify the mediating effects of fertilizer, pesticide, and machinery input intensity. Finally, a heterogeneity analysis was conducted to illustrate the impact of participation in agricultural cooperatives on the environmental performance of apple production for smallholder farmers. The results showed that the apple production system’s negative environmental impacts from the agricultural material production phase were more significant compared to the farming phase, with a contribution potential of 56.50%. Farm size directly impacts the environmental effects of apple production, and there is a U-shaped trend between the two, implying that from the perspective of environmental effects, larger farm size is not better. There were some mediating effects in the paths of farm size on the environmental effects, and the largest effect was fertilizer input intensity with a full mediating effect; the second largest effect was machinery input intensity with a partial mediating effect, and the mediating effect accounted for 15.50–15.89% of the total effect; the mediating effect of pesticide input intensity was not significant. In addition, the study also found that joining agricultural cooperatives was beneficial in promoting the improvement of the negative environmental impact caused by apple production. These findings provide insights into optimizing farm inputs for apple production and identifying the appropriate farm size to alleviate multiple environmental impacts, intending to make a marginal contribution to promoting sustainable development of the apple industry in China also providing the research evidence for the comparative study of the environmental burdens of apple production in China and other countries in the world.

T1  - The Influence of Privatised Agricultural Extension on Downward Accountability to Smallholder Tea Farmers
AN  - 2732215746; EJ1353311
AB  - Purpose: To assess the extent to which privatised extension service, which is premised to be demand-driven, delivers downward accountability to smallholder farmers who are both owners and users of agricultural services. Design/methodology/approach: The research collected data through focus group discussions with smallholder tea farmers and key informant interviews after which the information were corroborated with semi-structured interviews with 104 smallholder farmers. Findings: Our findings show that KTDA (Kenya Tea Development Agency) extension service has in recent years embraced methodologies that allow two-way information exchange and farmers' involvement in planning, implementing and evaluation of extension programmes. While this transition has provided opportunities for increased accountability and empowerment of smallholder farmers, downward accountability is limited by among others; presence of multiple accountabilities, a heavy top-down governance structure, higher incentives for upward accountability, limited resourcing of extension delivery, excessive workload and unrealistic targets on the part of extension staff and weak extension-research-farmer linkages. Practical implications: The findings of this study may be used by policymakers, extension practitioners and organisations delivering extension services to improve downward accountability and quality of advisory services Theoretical implications: The paper contributes to the debate on outcomes of privatisation on extension provision using the accountability lens in an area dominated by perceptions on costs and payment for the services. Originality/value: The literature on downward accountability on privatised extension services is lacking. The paper also extends the framework for assessing the performance of pluralistic extension services to develop and apply a framework for assessing downward accountability in privatised extension.

T1  - Informal finance: its drivers and contributions to farm investment among rural farmers in Northcentral Nigeria
AN  - 2719284688
AB  - Purpose>The problem of inaccessibility of finance for farm investment is a common phenomenon among farmers, especially the rural dwellers. Thus, there is a need to know how the accessibility of informal finance can be increased to increase farm investment. Therefore, this study evaluates farmers’ access to informal finance and its contribution to farm investment among rural farmers in Northcentral Nigeria.Design/methodology/approach>A three-stage random sampling technique was employed to select 160 farmers. Primary data collected were analysed with descriptive statistics and the Heckman selection model.Findings>The study revealed that cooperative society is the major informal means of loan acquisition used by the farmers followed by Rotational Savings and Credit Associations (RoSCAs). Informal loans contributed to agricultural investment through the various operational activities involved in production. Factors influencing farmers’ access to informal loans were the age, farm size and income of the farmers. Interest charged, farmers' age, farming experience, household size, education and loan duration were the drivers of the amount borrowed from the informal financing sector.Practical implications>The findings of the study call for policies that will sustain informal financial institutions in developing economies, like Nigeria. Thus, the government through its regulatory agencies should assist informal finance providers with the necessary resources to achieve more goals. This is because the informal credit lenders help in bridging financial gaps created by formal financial institutions, such as commercial banks.Originality/value>Unlike the previous research studies, this study investigated the driving factors of the amount borrowed from informal finance and its use in farm investment.

T1  - The Effects of Agricultural Socialized Services on Sustainable Agricultural Practice Adoption among Smallholder Farmers in China
AN  - 2716479503
AB  - In recent years, a growing body of literature has explored the determinants and impacts of sustainable agricultural technologies. However, little is known about the relationship between agricultural socialized services that have reshaped the smallholder agricultural system and promoted scale operation in rural China and environmentally friendly agricultural innovation adoption of the farm. Our study examines the effects of agricultural socialized services on the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs). In this study, we capture the number of SAPs adopted, unlike most existing studies that analyze the dichotomous decision of agricultural technology adoption. We apply an endogenous-treatment Poisson regression model to analyze using a national representative farm-level survey data set with 1357 farm households from 132 villages in China. The results show that socialized service use has a significantly positive effect on the number of SAPs adopted. Our results suggest that agricultural socialized services can promote the adoption of sustainable agricultural technologies among smallholders, and thus help transform conventional agriculture into sustainable agriculture.

T1  - Factors Affecting Smallholder Farmers’ Marketing Channel Choice in China with Multivariate Logit Model
AN  - 2716470846
AB  - Facing the changes in China’s agricultural products marketing channel, smallholder farmers with different characteristics choose various strategies to obtain more benefits. To analyze factors affecting smallholder farmers’ marketing channel choice, we classify four types of channels—Broker Channel, Farmers’ Retailing Channel, Wholesale Market Channel, and Cooperative Channel—and inspect 14 variables based on the survey data of 317 households from four provinces. We use a principal components analysis (PCA) to simplify these 14 variables into seven common factors and a multivariate logit model to study how the factors influence smallholder farmers’ choices. We find that compared with the Broker Channel, the Farmers’ Retailing Channel is mainly affected by the logistics factor, skill factor, risk factor, and size factor; the Wholesale Market Channel is influenced by the logistics factor and age factor; and the Cooperative Channel is mainly influenced by the age factor, logistics factor, and price factor. In conclusion, the logistics factor has a significant positive effect on each channel choice, and the improvement of the market and transportation conditions has a general promoting effect.

T1  - Optimization of alternative breeding schemes for the genetic improvement of common Tigray highland sheep in northern Ethiopia
AN  - 2715516564
AB  - Background
Genetic improvement is one of the major means to enhance the productivity of livestock, and well-designed animal genetic improvement schemes are necessary to achieve genetic gains. The objective of the current study was to design an alternative breeding program to improve the productivity of common Tigray highland sheep. Two village- and two central nucleus-based breeding schemes were simulated and evaluated in terms of genetic gain, bio-economic efficiency and operational feasibility.
Methods
Four breeding schemes were simulated: scheme 1, a one-tier cooperative village-based breeding scheme, scheme 2, a two-tier cooperative village breeding scheme (dispersed village-based nuclei scheme), scheme 3, a central open nucleus-based scheme with 5% nucleus size; and scheme 4, a three-tier breeding schemes (central open nucleus-based linked with multiplier units). Simulation analyses were performed using the ZPLAN computer program, which is based on a deterministic approach to estimate genetic and economic gains in the breeding programs.
Results
Between the two village-based breeding schemes, scheme 2 showed higher genetic gain and economic efficiency in the breeding traits analysed than scheme 1. The central nuclei schemes were more efficient than the village breeding schemes. Scheme 3 was the most efficient with a genetic gain in the breeding objective of US $ 1.03 and a profit of US $ 2.73/ewe/year, but operationally it is also the most difficult to implement as it requires a big central nucleus. A central nucleus linked with the village-based nuclei would be a feasible option to overcome the operational difficulties of the conventional central nucleus schemes. If a village-based breeding program is considered it should be the first step in most low-input systems. In this case, scheme 2 is the most efficient.
Conclusions
With some support from the public sector at the outset and a strong collaboration among the stakeholders including smallholders, scheme 4 could lead to substantial genetic gains in the common Tigray highland sheep breed within its habitat that covers large areas of the Tigray region. Therefore, we recommend a long-term breeding program which should include cross-breeding, genomic selection, updated estimates of genetic and economic values for the common Tigray highland sheep breed.

T1  - Economic Analysis of Alternative Ware Potato Storage Technologies in Uganda
AN  - 2708764624
AB  - In Uganda, potato is primarily grown as a cash crop and smallholder farmers sell majority of their produce immediately after harvest. Only a few farmers store ware potato for later sale using various traditional storage methods. Main reasons are farmers’ immediate need for cash, the low volumes of potato harvested, fear of loss during storage due to pests and diseases, and a lack of adequate storage facilities. In order to exploit the seasonal market price fluctuations and increase the economic return of potato farming, improved individual and collective ambient ware potato storage units were introduced. Unlike traditional storage facilities that maintain the marketability of stored potato up to five weeks only, improved ambient stores can maintain their marketability up to nine weeks. This article uses cost-benefit analysis methods to compare the economic performance of improved ambient stores with traditional storage facilities. Results indicate that few of the traditional and improved collective storage units generated profit, an aspect that was attributed to management challenges. The improved individual stores performed overall well, generating higher profit margins than improved collective stores. Improved individual stores had an average payback period of three to four years that could even be reduced to less than one year if used at full capacity. Due to their characteristics, improved individual ambient ware potato stores thus seem to be particularly suitable to substantially increase the income of potato farming households.

T1  - Business Planning for Group of Livestock Breeders in Reaching 1,000 Cows and Independence of Breeder
AN  - 2680350061
AB  - The ability to ensure food availability for the population is a challenge for the government during decreasing agricultural/livestock land, farmer regeneration, namely the reduced interest of the younger generation in agriculture and animal husbandry, the use of new technology and other things.

From the three data displayed, although beef production continues to increase, beef prices also continue to increase, one of which is caused by the inability of cattle farmers to control prices. 1.2Cattle Farm Management The People's Animal Husbandry School - Sekolah Peternakan Rakyat (SPR) is a program created by the Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) which was formed with the intention of educating small-scale farmers (hereinafter referred to as community breeders) through participatory learning for a maximum of four years so that they can be independent & sovereign in running a collective business in congregation or mutual business.

The capacity of breeders who are filled with knowledge about various technical and non-technical aspects will be able to increase the awareness of smallholder farmers to take actions that are oriented towards developing the competence of farmers themselves.

Since 2012 the program has been running, the type of cattle breeding business has not been running as expected.

Another thing is, breeders are still aiming for the short term, namely the next 2-3 years according to the needs of life. 2.ANALYSIS To see the condition of the Berkarya group, the author conducted a study of the value of Natural Increase (NI), Reproduction Efficiency (ER), Net Replacement Rate (NRR) dan Population Dynamics. 2.1 Natural Increase (NI) Is a unit of calculation of natural growth obtained by subtracting the birth rate with the death rate in a certain area and time.

T1  - What Drives Smallholders to Utilize Socialized Agricultural Services for Farmland Scale Management? Insights from the Perspective of Collective Action
AN  - 2679779795
AB  - The diseconomies of scale found in smallholders’ agricultural production is a common problem faced by global agricultural development. Notable examples of regions in which this occurs include Central and Eastern Europe, India, Brazil, and China. Smallholders usually differ in their demands for socialized agricultural services due to scattered farmland, various soil conditions, different selections of crop varieties, and diverse farming arrangements. Such differences make it difficult for smallholders to cooperate on farmland scale management, resulting in a collective action dilemma. Based on the Institutional Analysis and Development framework, this paper provides insights into the influencing factors and effects of smallholders’ utilization of socialized agricultural services and constructs a cooperative mechanism for the purpose of solving the collective action dilemma in rural areas of China. We found that household characteristics, biophysical conditions, attributes of community, and rules-in-use jointly generate the action situation in the process of smallholders’ cooperative utilization of agricultural socialized services. Among them, the rules-in-use not only have a direct impact on the action situation but also regulate the role of the other three sets of factors. Various factors and mechanisms affecting the cooperative utilization of socialized agricultural services by smallholders interact in the action arena and finally form relevant outcomes that can deal with the diseconomies of farmland fragmentation. These outcomes will be fed back to each external variable again along the feedback path, so as to promote the system and create a virtuous circle. This study provides a theoretical contribution to understanding smallholders’ cooperation in the process of agricultural large-scale operation, especially in regions and countries with a large number of smallholders.

T1  - Unravelling the Paradoxical Seasonal Food Scarcity in a Peasant Microregion of Mexico
AN  - 2674408960
AB  - Seasonal food scarcity during pre-harvest months is, widely, considered to be the principal manifestation of food insecurity, for some 600 million members of smallholder families, who rely on a variety of coping strategies. This paper analyses both the peasant-economy variables that explain the presence and intensity of seasonal food scarcity, and the coping strategies of 120 rural households in a microregion of southern Mexico. We, also, examine how supply networks for six archetypical foods of the peasant diet express robustness or vulnerability during seasons of abundance and scarcity. The method combines surveys, ethnographic fieldwork, statistical models and social network analyses. Results show that 74% of households experience at least one month of food scarcity annually, and 34% of shortages last more than six months. In total, 29% of affected households gather wild foods, and 14% use intense coping strategies, such as international migration, taking out rural loans, and parental food buffering. During scarce seasons, self-sufficiency networks for maize and beans contract, but still maintain the food supply of peasant households, while cash-consumption networks such as those of beef become accessible only to a small sector of economically differentiated households. In contrast to the vast majority of research, which simply reports the presence of seasonal food shortages and describes the coping strategies of rural households, this paper provides an in-depth analysis—based upon a novel methodological integration—of the socioeconomic, agrifood, and land tenure conditions that may determine why many peasant territories in the Global South face the “farmer–food-scarcity paradox”.

T1  - Social Network, Sense of Responsibility, and Resident Participation in China’s Rural Environmental Governance
AN  - 2674342192
AB  - Based on a survey of 2343 rural residents in China, this paper adopts a binary logistic regression model as the analytical tool to study the impact of rural residents’ social network and sense of responsibility regarding their participation in environmental governance. The results show that the cost, frequency and scope of social network activities have positive and significant influences on resident participation in rural environmental governance. The cost of a social network is conducive to building a rural social network, enhancing the connection of interests and promoting the formation of a rural community. Extending social network objectives from family members to villagers can improve the cultural identity and emotional identity of rural residents. The increase in the frequency of social network activities can not only enhance trust among residents, but also reduce the cost of environmental governance mobilization. The scope of a social network acts as an inhibitor whereby social interaction beyond the scope of rural areas will reduce identification with rural emotions. The four dimensions, including responsibility cognition, responsibility will, responsibility emotion and responsibility behavior have significant influences on resident participation in rural environmental governance. Residents’ sense of responsibility plays the role of an introverted driving force for them to take part in rural environmental governance, which itself helps to overcome “non-participation” behaviors of “rational smallholders” to a certain extent. Furthermore, it endows rural environmental governance with resilience. So, it is of significance to enhance rural residents’ social networks and to improve rural residents’ cognition of collective responsibility.

T1  - The Effect of Social Networks on Smallholder Farmers’ Decision to Join Farmer-Base Seed Producer Cooperatives (FBSc): The Case of Hararghe, Oromia, Ethiopia
AN  - 2670165585
AB  - The paper presents the results of analysis conducted to empirically establish the role of social network in smallholder farmers’ decision to join seed producer cooperative, in Hararghe, Oromia, Ethiopia. We used a ‘random matching within sample’ technique to generate data on social links and resources shared like information among their links. Average treatment effects were used to limit ‘non-awareness’ or ‘selection bias’ on participation rate. An econometric strategy was employed to isolate endogenous effect from correlated and contextual social network effects and analyzed by Probit model. Rainfall data was obtained from NMA for 1986–2018 years and analyzed by coefficient of variation (CV) and standardized anomalies index (Z). The result CV and Z shows intra- and inter seasonal variability of rainfall and, the severity and frequency of drought have increase which works against a single optimum seed source. Rate of membership to FBSc was 75% for exposed sub-sample against 70% for the full sample. This shows the existence of exposure bias. The size of social network, linkage with relatives and extension agents influence farmers’ decision to join FBSc and thus, the presence of endogenous effects of social networks. Thus, participation decision is more likely to be affected by characters and structure of social network. Access to off-farm income and perception on profit influences farmer participation decision where weather-indexed seed insurance can service as an effective strategy to ensure sustained membership. Therefore, any intervention in promotion of FBSc should consider the characters’ and structure of social network and emphasis on indexed-based seed insurance and climate information services as strategy to promote seed producers cooperatives.

T1  - Does linking women farmers to markets improve food security? Evidence from rural Bangladesh
AN  - 2666621382
AB  - Background 
This study examined the effect of linking small-scale women farmers to markets, referred to as community marketing, and homestead food production extension services in two districts of rural Bangladesh.
 Method 
We particularly focused on identifying the relationship between treatment and food security, monthly expenditure patterns, and food production and marketing by adopting a doubly robust method that mediated bias from project site selection and potential misspecification of the postulated outcome or treatment model.
 Results 
The main results showed that establishing community marketing sites along with extension services provided women farmers a secured marketing outlet for food production, plausibly associated with a decreased likelihood of a reduction in monthly expenditures on healthcare (12.7 percentage points), child education (19.4 percentage points), and transportation (51.5 percentage points) during the lean season. However, if farmers did not spend extra income generated from marketing on food purchases, it would be difficult to anticipate an improvement in food security.
 Conclusion 
Community marketing was devised to link women smallholders to the markets without conflicting with social and cultural norms for which women were responsive, and our research findings supported the claim that they benefited from community marketing participation. Therefore, government, NGO, or other extension providers looking for a culturally appropriate approach to address women farmers’ limited mobility may consider using or modifying community marketing.

T1  - Plot Size, Adjacency, and Farmland Rental Contract Choice
AN  - 2652995419
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of plot size on the components of farmland rental contracts choice and evaluate the effects of its heterogeneities on different plot characteristics in the context of China. Based on the data from a nationally representative sample of 1215 plots among 5 provinces in rural China, this paper yields robust results using regional fixed effect method and SUR model. The results show that plot size significantly affects farmland rental contract choice. The probability of renting from non-relatives, signing a written contract, and renting with a fixed term increases by 0.5%, 0.9%, and 0.6% with 1 mu increase of plot size, respectively, and the annual rent rises by RMB 3.514 per mu. The effects of plot size on contract form, contract rent, and contract term were much larger for adjacent plots, especially for the flat and eastern plots. The findings imply that the government should encourage the innovation of managing or using plots that are of small size or non-adjacent to promote the integration of farmland resources for the formalization of farmland rental contracts, especially for mountain and western areas.

T1  - The Sustainability of Contract Farming with Specialized Suppliers to Modern Retailers: Insights from Vegetable Marketing in Indonesia
AN  - 2642319638
AB  - Specialized suppliers to supermarkets in rural Java showed that smallholder farmers could engage in contract farming with the rise of retail modernization. This paper examines whether they have sustained contract farming with the recent decline of modernized stores. Our field survey, based on cases reported by the World Bank in 2006, provides the following findings: (1) Some suppliers failed to sustain contract farming due to growers’ hold-up problems; (2) The suppliers could prevent contract breaching by either undertaking contract-specific investments to train growers or provide inputs. Moreover, they selected growers based on their social reputation to avoid contract breaching; (3) We found that farmers in breach of contract farming on the modern channel begin to arrange farmers’ groups by themselves and return to the traditional channel as a new type of intermediaries. This indicates an evolution of the traditional marketing channel with the supermarket revolution.

T1  - Agrobiodiversity conservation with illegal-drug crops: An approach from the prisons in Oaxaca, Mexico
AN  - 2641591921
AB  - Drawing on political-ecological vulnerability theory, this paper analyzes the impact of illegal-drug cultivation and its related violence on smallholder agrobiodiversity in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. Oaxaca is a global agrobiodiversity hotspot where cannabis and opium poppy have been widely cultivated for decades. The study is based on 76 structured/semi-structured interviews with imprisoned farmers, harvest gatherers, and former soldiers in four state prisons. Results show that illegal-drug crops and native-food crops complement each other until a threshold of violence is crossed, which leads to the abandonment of agriculture due to murder, imprisonment, and out-migration. The specialization of smallholder agriculture in illegal-drug crops tends to favor crossing the threshold of violence. In most municipalities in this study, however, rather a diversification process took place in which illegal-drug crops were incorporated to food production systems, reducing both the exposure and the sensitivity of smallholders to structural and direct violence. Other adaptation strategies involved local organization and militarization of smallholders for collective-risk management and territorial control. Ultimately, by comparing five vulnerability scenarios, this paper argues that the combination of peasant organization, militarization, and crop/livelihood diversification in Oaxaca mitigates the violent agrarian change associated with this illegal economy, while conserving agrobiodiversity.

T1  - Passive cooling strategies for cattle housing on small farms: A case study
AN  - 2636868785
AB  - Small-scale beef cattle farmers in tropical zones face climate variability, especially during the hot summer months. As the temperature rises, beef cattle are exposed to heat stress, resulting in lower beef quality and production yields and higher costs of livestock farming. With many restrictions on the part of smallholders raising beef cattle, one way to reduce this impact on small farms is to design cattle housing that helps protect against direct and indirect solar heat and removes the heat from the house effectively. This study has used the concept of passive cooling design to improve the beef cattle houses of smallholders. The farmers' existing limitations, both in capital and construction capacity, are taken into account. Housing size, roof shape and roofing materials were modified to give adequate protection against heat and increase cross and stack ventilation. In addition, the positions of the buildings around the cattle house were rearranged to allow more draught into the house. After renovation, the indoor temperature was observed to be up to 5°C lower than the outside temperature, and the humidity was reduced by 60-72%.

T1  - Strategies to optimize the use of organic fertilizers in smallholder coffee plantation
AN  - 2635869215
AB  - The demand for organic coffee is increasing in line with increasing competition and consumer preferences for healthier products. On the other hand, the application of organic fertilizers in smallholder coffee plantations is still low. The research aims to map the constraints of organic fertilizers usage and develop strategies to accelerate organic fertilizers application in smallholder coffee plantations. Data analysis was performed using the scoring method. The results showed that farmers applied more inorganic fertilizers. Constraints of organic fertilizers application are related to technical, economic, and institutional aspects. Strategies to optimize the use of organic fertilizers in smallholder coffee plantations include providing capital and financial support with subsidized interest rates and strengthening farmer institutions as the priority. Other strategies include introducing an integrated coffee livestock system and providing local government incentives for promoting and organic certification assistance. Institutions involved in implementing the strategy include local governments, research institutes, financial institutions, coffee processing industries, exporters, extension officers, certification bodies, farmers’ groups, cooperatives, and associations. The strategies are essential to overcome the existing problems and constraints in organic coffee farming development and increase farmers’ interest in applying organic fertilizers.

T1  - Impacts of COVID-19 on Small-Scale Dairy Enterprises in an Indian Megacity—Insights from Greater Bengaluru
AN  - 2633184692
AB  - Natural calamities and pandemics massively affect small-scale entrepreneurs. In this paper, we aim to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic affected small dairy farms in the megacity of Bengaluru, India, where they supply a high share of the milk demand. In 2020 a total of 129 farms were visited before the first lockdown (January to March) and interviewed again after the lockdown had been loosened (August to September). Questions addressed feed supply to dairy cows, milk yield and marketing, and coping strategies for lockdown impacts. Results showed that the share of farmers not feeding concentrates increased from 1% before lockdown to 7% afterward (p < 0.05), and those not offering dry forages increased from 20% to 33% (p < 0.05) due to increasing forage prices. Milk yield dropped in all surveyed farms from 3905 L before to 2861 L after lockdown (p < 0.05) due to the sale of 30% of lactating cows across the farms. Enabling farmers to better cope with shocks through feed storage and by processing their surplus milk into durable products should be prioritised by supporting institutions such as dairy cooperatives. Alternatively, insurance schemes can capacitate farmers to maintain a fresh milk supply to urban consumers in the wake of global challenges.

T1  - Technology and Managerial Gaps in Contract Farming: The Case of Specialty Crop Production
AN  - 2630954806
AB  - We use a stochastic frontier approach corrected for self-selection to separate technology and managerial gaps between the treatment and control groups of smallholders in baby corn production in India. We also assess the impact of contract farming on output prices, profitability, and resource usage. We find that technical efficiency is consistently higher among contract farmers than among independent farmers and that significant technology and managerial gaps exist between contracted and independent growers. Ultimately, contract farming intervention benefits the livelihood of smallholders, increases efficiency, and reduces environmental degradation without compromising yield.

T1  - Mobile Internet adoption and technology adoption extensity: evidence from litchi growers in southern China
AN  - 2619206632
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to examine the effects of mobile Internet adoption on technology adoption extensity.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses cross-sectional data collected in 2018 from 932 smallholder litchi farmers in Guangdong Province and Guangxi Province in southern China. A Poisson regression with endogenous treatment effects (ETPR) model is applied to estimate the effects of mobile Internet adoption on technology adoption extensity.FindingsThe ETPR model results indicate that mobile Internet adoption can significantly enhance technology adoption extensity. In addition, the extensity of technology adoption is also determined by education level, training, share of litchi farming income, guidebook use and cooperative membership. Disaggregated analyses further confirm the positive impact of mobile Internet adoption on the number of capital- and labor-intensive technologies adopted.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the literature on agricultural technology adoption. The findings highlight the need to facilitate modern agricultural technology penetration by promoting the use of mobile Internet technologies.

T1  - Preferences for tree fruit market attributes among smallholder farmers in Eastern Rwanda
AN  - 2619093484
AB  - The increasing demand for high‐value agricultural products such as fresh fruit presents opportunities for farmers in developing countries due to their higher market value compared with traditional staple crops. This study uses data on trust, risk, and time preferences obtained through behavioral experiments, combined with a discrete choice experiment to understand their effect on farmers’ choices of marketing attributes, collecting data from 252 farmers from Eastern Rwanda. The results reveal that farmers, overall, have positive attitudes toward collective marketing channels with guaranteed immediate payments, written contracts, provision of inputs, credit, and training, a personal relationship with a buyer, and low investment costs. Additionally, farmers with lower levels of risk aversion were found to have a greater preference for immediate payment than farmers with higher levels of risk aversion. Farmers with higher future orientation are more likely to choose contracts that guarantee inputs and/or services and written contracts, and they attach lower relative importance to immediate payments than farmers with lower future orientation. Farmers with higher trust levels attach lower relative importance to immediate payments, written contracts, and a personal relationship with a buyer than farmers with lower trust levels.

T1  - Supermarket contracts, opportunity cost and trade-offs, and farm household welfare: Panel data evidence from Kenya
AN  - 2617214412
AB  - While previous studies analyzed the welfare effects of smallholder participation in supermarket channels, little is known about the effects over time of supplying supermarkets on farm household incomes and diets, possible trade-offs, and opportunity costs of supermarkets on different income sources. We use panel data from smallholder vegetable farmers in Kenya to address these research gaps. The results show that supermarket contracts increase overall income by 61% and the dietary diversity score of nutritious foods by 4%, on average. Supermarket contracts also increase farm income without sacrificing income from other sources. In terms of participation dynamics, supermarket stayers and dropouts achieve overall income gains, but newcomers do not immediately benefit, due to their huge initial capital investment. Supermarket participation is not a panacea for all smallholder marketing and livelihood challenges but benefits farmers who can meet contractual requirements.

T1  - Private and state‐led contract farming in Zimbabwe: Accumulation, social differentiation and rural politics
AN  - 2616238259
AB  - Contract farming schemes often amplify existing patterns of socio‐economic differentiation. In Zimbabwe, processes of differentiation were underway before the current expansion of contract farming and they have deepened through the Fast Track Land Reform process. This article examines how pre‐existing dynamics of differentiation shape the forms of contract farming adopted, as well as which groups of farmers gain access and on what terms. Social differentiation partly explains the outcomes of contract farming, even if contract farming in turn results in further differentiation. This article contrasts private sector‐led contract farming of tobacco and state‐led financing of maize production (the ‘command agriculture’ programme) in two high‐potential sites and across different forms of land use. Unlike in many other settings, contract farming in Zimbabwe is highly influenced by the state, through the regulation of private sector arrangements and the establishment of a state‐led contracting programme. The state‐led programme boosted maize production amongst medium‐scale farmers and resulted in an embedding of patronage relations. Meanwhile, the private‐led contract farming has supported a widespread boom of tobacco production, mainly amongst smallholders. We find therefore that contract farming is highly dependent on the contingent, politically mediated processes of social differentiation.

T1  - Contract farming, contract design and smallholder livelihoods
AN  - 2616183159
AB  - Contract farming has gained in importance in many developing countries. Previous studies analysed effects of contracts on smallholder farmers’ welfare, yet mostly without considering that different types of contractual relationships exist. Here, we examine associations between contract farming and farm household income in the oil palm sector of Ghana, explicitly differentiating between two types of contracts, namely simple marketing contracts and more comprehensive resource‐providing contracts. Moreover, we look at different income sources to better understand how both contracts are linked to farmers’ livelihood strategies. We use cross‐sectional survey data and regression models. Issues of endogeneity are addressed through measuring farmers' willingness‐to‐participate in contracts and using this indicator as an additional covariate. Farmers with both types of contracts have significantly higher household incomes than farmers without a contract, yet with notable differences in terms of the income sources. Farmers with a marketing contract allocate more household labour to off‐farm activities and thus have higher off‐farm income. In contrast, farmers with a resource‐providing contract have larger oil palm plantations and thus higher farm incomes. The findings suggest that the two contract types are associated with different livelihood strategies and that disaggregated analysis of different income sources is important to better understand possible underlying mechanisms.

T1  - The resurgence of agricultural mechanisation in Ethiopia: rhetoric or real commitment?
AN  - 2611824509
AB  - Ethiopia’s agricultural development strategies bypassed smallholder mechanisation for decades. Mechanisation returned to the policy agenda in 2013 but recent pro-mechanisation rhetoric lacks operational commitments. Based on primary and secondary data, this paper traces the policies and policy narratives that have led to low mechanisation, and finds that mechanisation was deprioritised on the grounds that Ethiopia is labour- and land-abundant, but short of capital. With policy encouraging multiple cropping, but farming vulnerable to climate change, the paper argues for the development of a market for mechanisation, including mechanisation service provision through private and cooperative agents, to enhance smallholder access to mechanisation and unleash human energy.

T1  - Assessing sustainability factors of farmer seed production: a case of the Good Seed Initiative project in Tanzania
AN  - 2729509453
AB  - BackgroundQuality seed is at the core of the technological packages needed to increase crop production, nutrition, and rural wellbeing. However, smallholder farmers in Tanzania have limited access to affordable quality seeds, and over 90% of seed sown is saved by farmers from previous harvests, though its quality is often poor. The Good Seed Initiative (GSI) aimed to enhance access to quality African indigenous vegetable (AIV) seed in Tanzania, through the promotion of farmer seed production, using two models—contract farming and Quality Declared Seed (QDS). This study assessed post-GSI project sustainability factors and explored the prospects for replicating the approach in a wider regional context.MethodsThe study was conducted in Arusha and Dodoma, targeting locations where the GSI project was implemented. Qualitative tools employing focus group discussions (73 men, 69 women), and key informant interviews were used for data collection.ResultsFarmer seed production under both models continued to thrive, creating avenues for income diversification and contributing over 50% to household incomes. Farmer seed production contributed to increased availability of quality seed for vegetable growers, especially in central Tanzania that is less served by the formal sector. However, QDS production was challenged by a lack of access to foundation seed, inspections, and seed testing services, which are key for quality seed production.ConclusionsResults reveal unequivocally that farmer seed production offers a potentially sustainable solution to the problem of seed supply while providing income benefits for seed producers. The market-based approach used by the project and partnerships with the formal sector, coupled with stimulation of demand through nutritional awareness campaigns, were strong contributory factors to the survival of farmer seed production. Farmer-led seed systems, especially QDS, deserve support from the government to develop a tailored and appropriate seed system that meets the ever-evolving needs of smallholder farmers. Adoption gender-inclusive approaches, particularly in contract farming is paramount to benefit women as much as men.

T1  - Financing smallholder tree planting: Tree collateral & Thai 'Tree Banks' - Collateral 2.0?
AN  - 2622815036
AB  - Smallholder foresters are amongst the key stakeholders for sustainable development and productive land use. In Thailand they face various challenges including insufficient tenure, burdensome commercialization, and limited access to markets. Similarly, forestry specific financial services are often unavailable. Key obstacles include cash flow constraints attributed to the long gestation periods and a lack of conventional collateral to obtain loans. As a response to the lack of sustainable financing mechanisms for forest smallholders, tree collateral and Tree Banks emerged in Thailand. This paper depicts the evolution of the innovative Thai tree collateral approaches and conceptualizes their intricacies. Tree collateral refers to the use of trees as a business security for loans. Thailand's innovative national Tree Bank systems provide the context for this case study. Based on expert interviews (n = 39) and subsequent secondary literature review as well as process tracing, the article explores potentials and shortcomings of the tree collateral approaches in Thailand. There are significant conceptual and ideological differences between the two Tree Bank institutions, namely the Tree Bank BAAC (Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives) and Tree Bank CSO (Civil Society Organization). These differences focus on the need to include private land together with trees as collateral. In addition, core constraints remain for tree collateral such as limited tenure and valuation procedures and high gearing ratios. The discussion of risks reveals mainly socio-economic and financial risks for smallholders and financing institutions. Standardization procedures and mitigation strategies including micro-insurances are indispensable. The process tracing revealed causal mechanisms that lead to tree collateral, including aggregation amongst smallholders as well as specific enabling policy reforms. Tree collateral represents an innovative and promising tool but is not the 'silver bullet' that magically solves the financial challenges of smallholders. Rather it is niche-specific and requires a series of broader prerequisites for successful and low-risk implementation especially in the context of smallholder forestry.

T1  - Building trust in rural producer organizations: results from a randomized controlled trial
AN  - 2615008851
AB  - Trust is considered an important factor for successful collective action in groups of smallholder farmers. A prime example is collective commercialization of agricultural produce through producer organizations. While previous research has focused on trust as an exogenous determinant of participation in groups, this article tests whether trust within existing groups can be improved using a training program. We conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial in rural Senegal to identify the effects of training members and/or leaders with respect to commercialization on intragroup trust. Our design allows identifying both direct treatment effects of having participated in the training and spillover effects on farmers who did not partake. Looking at different measures of trust in leaders’ competence and motives and of trust in members, we find that participating in the training significantly enhances both trust in leaders and trust in members. For trust in leaders, we also find a strong spillover effect. Our findings suggest that relatively soft and noncostly interventions such as group training appear to positively affect trust within producer organizations.

T1  - Strengthening producer organizations to increase market access of smallholder farmers in Uganda
AN  - 2615007792
AB  - Smallholder agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa is largely exposed to pervasive market failures, translating into missed opportunities and sub-optimal economic behavior. These failures can partly be traced to the importance of economies of scale in procuring inputs and marketing produce, where smallholders face disproportionately high transaction costs. Producer organizations could help to lessen transaction costs; however, only a few farmers in Uganda sell through them. We introduce two interventions aimed at promoting marketing via producer organizations: cash on delivery, and information on sales, and analyze their impacts in an RCT design: We find that providing cash on delivery increases the probability that a member chooses to sell through the group, and hence the volumes bulked by each group. This increase in volumes appears to have enabled groups to secure higher prices for their produce. No significant effect could be found for providing information on sales.

T1  - Characterization of farmer‐based cooperative societies in the upper west region of Ghana: Annales de l'economie Collective
AN  - 2593293620
AB  - The study describes the ownership and governance characteristics and the challenges of farmer‐based cooperative societies from three districts in the Upper West Region of Ghana. Primary data were obtained from 59 active and 14 inactive cooperatives in the selected districts. The study concludes that Ghanaian cooperatives in the sample bear much resemblance to the traditional form which emerged in Europe and North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Generally, such cooperatives have relatively small memberships from local communities who use a democratic governance system and do not delegate control to outsiders. While the cost of owning and transacting is limited with such characteristics, many traditional cooperatives lack the specific knowledge, economic efficiency, and resource endowment necessary to become or remain competitive. Indeed, the active cooperatives listed finance, access to inputs, tractor services and poor leadership as key challenges, while inactive cooperatives blamed poor member commitment as the primary culprit for their inactivity. Efforts aimed at promoting and supporting farmer cooperatives should focus on addressing these key challenges. Also, financial and technical support should probably be conditional on group performance and not group formation itself.

T1  - Social gains for artisanal agroindustrial producers induced by cooperation and collaboration in agri-food supply chain
AN  - 2593367197
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to analyze which collective actions (cooperation, coordination and collaboration), present in the supply chain of artisanal products, generate positive effects in terms of social gains.Design/methodology/approachThe authors conduct multiple case studies in the supply chain of seven artisanal agroindustries in the Distrito Federal, Brazil. The data were collected through interviews, documental analysis and direct observation. The data were analyzed using the content analysis technique proposed by Bardin (1977). With priori and a posteriori analytical categories, it was possible to conduct: a detailed analysis of the current situation of artisanal agroindustries regarding collective actions from the perspective of supplier/supplier and supplier/client and a detailed analysis for the possible effects of collective actions that impact the supply chain and the indicators of social sustainability of artisanal agroindustries.FindingsThe results indicate that cooperation and collaboration have contributed positively in the transactions of the products of the artisanal agroindustries, reflecting in social gains for the producing families. In this context, some collective actions can be highlighted as follows: the collective commercial spaces, the demonstration spaces of the artisan products in the clients’ environment, the prospecting of improvements from the final consumers, the face-to-face meetings with the suppliers, the product dissemination by the customer, the joint marketing actions and the rationalization of transportation logistics.Research limitations/implicationsThe study used a qualitative approach and findings and discussion are inherently interpretative and cannot be generalized.Practical implicationsThis study can contribute to researchers and practitioners interested in collective actions contributing to the incrementation of social responsibility in agri-food supply chains.Social implicationsUnderstanding how the collective actions support the inclusion of smallholding and artisanal producers in agri-food supply chains can help policymakers and managers to implement initiatives related to social responsibility, which can be measured using social indicators. This creates a social benefit through rural growth and economic development, generation of income and social productive inclusion of the artisanal producers in larger agri-food supply chains.Originality/valueFor the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper approaching collective actions as the main source of incrementation of social benefits, which can measure the incrementation of social responsibility in agri-food supply chains.

T1  - Tobacco farming and current debt status among smallholder farmers in Manicaland province in Zimbabwe
AN  - 2593674264
AB  - IntroductionZimbabwe is the largest producer of tobacco leaf in Africa and the sixth largest globally. Tobacco leaf is a mainstay of the economy, accounting for about 10% of the country’s GDP in 2018.MethodsWe use descriptive and regression analyses from a face-to-face survey of 381 smallholder farmers in three major tobacco-farming areas in Manicaland province to determine the prevalence of tobacco-related debt and some of its covariates. The survey was conducted in June and July 2019.Results74% of respondents are contract farmers and 26% are independent farmers. 57% of respondents indicated that they were in tobacco-related debt. The likelihood of being in tobacco-related debt is significantly more than average for farmers with the following characteristics (holding other characteristics constant): being a contract farmer, having a larger farm, employing only family labour and not recording expenses (as a proxy for financial sophistication). 91% of contract farmers would prefer to be independent farmers, while 63% of independent farmers would prefer to be contract farmers.ConclusionThere is no evidence to suggest that tobacco growing, in its current state, has benefited the tobacco farmers in Manicaland province. Tobacco farmers are largely victims, rather than beneficiaries, of the sector. There is a strong case for government intervention to improve the conditions of tobacco farmers, either through direct intervention in the tobacco-growing sector, or by encouraging and promoting crop substitution.

T1  - Envisioning the Future of Mosaic Landscapes: Actor Perceptions in a Mixed Cocoa/Oil-Palm Area in Ghana
AN  - 2590777031
AB  - The future and benefits of mosaic landscapes have been a source of scientific and societal concern due to increasing population growth, climate change, urbanization, and expanding agricultural commodities. There is a growing call for integrated landscape approaches in which landscape actors discuss trade-offs between different land uses with a view to reaching a negotiated decision on the allocation of land uses. Yet, the operationalization of such approaches is still in its infancy, and integrated methodologies to visualize actors’ landscape visions are still scarce. This study therefore presents a participatory spatial scenario-building methodology that uncovers local perceptions of landscape dynamics and needed actions in a mixed cocoa-oil-palm landscape in Ghana’s Eastern Region. The methodology visualizes landscape actors’ perceived plausible changes and desired future landscapes, and is designed to trigger discussions on actions needed to achieve these desired futures. Findings show that farmers and institutional actors are aware of their landscapes with future preferences coming close to actual landscape composition and spatial configuration, and that—contrary to common assumptions—only those in the oil-palm-dominated landscape who already experienced the drawbacks of increasing landscape homogenization desire a mosaic landscape. The paper concludes that the collective mapping process makes actors aware of challenges at landscape level and increases farmers’ negotiation power through active engagement in the process and visualization of their knowledge and visions. Application of the methodology requires dedicated funding, political will, and capacity to apply it as an ongoing process, as well as monitoring feedback loops.

T1  - Are infectious reproductive pathogens of large ruminants a threat to improving food security? An investigation from Cambodia
AN  - 2576141868
AB  - In Cambodia, information on common pathogens causing reproductive losses in cattle and buffalo are lacking, despite there being a need to address livestock health to enhance food security. We analysed stored buffalo (n = 29) and cattle (n = 471) serum samples collected in 2016 using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Antibodies to Neospora caninum, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo and Brucella abortus were detected in buffalo samples at 79.3% (95% CI 64.6–94.0), 3.4% (95% CI 0–10.0), 0% and 0%, respectively, and in cattle at 4.2% (95% CI 2.4–6.0), 6.4% (95% CI 4.2–8.6), 8.1% (95% CI 5.6–10.6) and 0%, respectively. The high N. caninum seroprevalence in buffalo was associated with increasing age, with buffalo having a 13.1% chance of being seropositive at birth, increasing to 99.4% by age 7 (p = 0.045). This suggests a predominance of horizontal transmission, possibly from exposure to faeces from free-roaming village dogs. Cattle L. interrogans serovar Hardjo seroprevalence was highest in Tbong Khmum province (20.4%) compared to other provinces (p < 0.001), and may be compromising bovine fertility and creating a zoonotic risk for smallholders who may contract leptospirosis from farm work. These high infection rates prompt further research to determine: to what extent these pathogens are linked to the low reproductive efficiency observed in large ruminants in Cambodia, the risk factors to pathogen exposure and appropriate strategies to reduce these risks. Low BVDV and B. abortus exposure is an important observation. Increasing large ruminant livestock trade into the country will require improved biosecurity and disease surveillance to prevent their emergence. An enhanced understanding of the status of infectious reproductive livestock pathogens in Cambodia can assist development projects to make evidence-based strategies to enhance cattle and buffalo health and improve food security.

T1  - Marketing channel preference among smallholder cocoyam farmers in South Africa
AN  - 2620410987
AB  - Marketing channel choice makes important contributions to the incomes and other livelihood attributes among smallholder farmers in developing countries. Often considered from a number of perspectives, the dominant view articulated suggests an advantageous integration into formal market channels. This position is questioned as it has implications for smallholder farmers' food security and rural incomes. Using a mixed methods approach, the study collected primary data from 174 smallholder farmers and applied both a descriptive and multinomial logit regression model to analyze factors contributing to cocoyam production and market channel choices among respondents in the study area. Findings indicate that financial returns and available markets were key factors in cocoyam production, while amount received was a driver of market channel choice among 89% of respondents who sold directly at farm-gate. Farmers' age (p=0.044), household size (p=0.043), distance to market (p=0.021), additional income (p=0.017) and amount received (p=0.014) were significant variables (p<.05) in the determinants of market channel choice. The study recommended improving market information provision and strengthening farmer associations which will enable smallholder farmers in rural communities to make informed choices with respect to produce price, access other markets and consolidate their collective market bargaining position.

T1  - SUSTAINABILITY STATUS AND COLLECTIVE CAGES BASED SMALLHOLDER FARMING BEEF CATTLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY IN LOMBOK ISLAND, INDONESIA*
AN  - 2584042315
AB  - Animal husbandry in Indonesia is still dominated by smallholder farms. Almost all of the cattle population are smallholder livestock businesses with relatively low levels of production and productivity. Beef cattle smallholder farming on the Island of Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara Province, is carried out using a group of collective cages, making it easier to manage and develop them. The development of beef cattle smallholder farming based on collective cages is a model of intensive beef cattle maintenance. This model is built by implementing integrated farmer group management by integrating various aspects (technical, social, economic and cultural) in the fields of management of maintenance, feed, breeding, animal health services, marketing, livestock manure management and livestock security systems. This study aims to analyze the sustainability status and development strategy of collective cagebased beef cattle for smallholder farming on the Island of Lombok, Indonesia. The method used to determine the sustainability status is Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) with the Rapid Appraisal Beef Cattle Smallholder (RAPBCS) approach. Sensitive attributes that affect the sustainability index and the effect of errors are determined based on Leverage analysis and Monte Carlo Test. The results of the sustainability analysis show that the dimensions of technical requirements collective cage 56.84; dimensions of collective cage management 58.04 and dimensions of animal health 56. The multidimensional analysis of the sustainability of the development of beef cattle smallholder farming is based on collective cages on the island of Lombok, obtained a combined dimension value of 57.0 with a fairly sustainable category. Determination of the 6 key factors of sustainability is obtained by prospective analysis to determine the future strategy for the development of collective cagebased beef cattle smallholder farming. The conclusion is that the sustainability status of the development of collective cage-based beef cattle smallholder farming on the island of Lombok Indonesia is in the fairly sustainable category with two recommended development strategies, namely: strategies to improve beef cattle health management and strengthening farmer institutions, farmer economic institutions, extension institutions and the role of community leaders.

T1  - Scaling up agriculture? The dynamics of land transfer in inland China
AN  - 2562923903
AB  - Major changes are taking place in the Chinese countryside. Long a smallholder dominant economy with small and fragmented farms, a suite of policies, regulations, and financial instruments are being mobilised to drive larger-scale, more commercialised, and more industrialised farming in China. Larger operators such as "dragon-head" agribusinesses are transforming production and supply chains, while the operational rights and titles over farmland are being formalised so that smallholders can more easily transfer their land to large-scale producers. This article aims to deepen our understanding of the extent and nature of land transfer in China by exploring its dynamics in inland provinces. It draws on a 2019 survey of more than 900 cash-cropping farms in four provinces (Hebei, Shaanxi, Hubei and Yunnan), semi-structured interviews, and secondary data. Our mixed methods approach supports in-depth analysis of the extent and dynamics of land transfer in apple, tea, orange and coffee-growing areas. We find that in contrast to national statistics, land transfer from smallholders to other operators is generally quite limited, a finding which highlights the ongoing viability of specialised smallholder farming and other site-specific barriers to scaling up. In the site where land transfer is most extensive, it is being driven by a state-agribusiness-cooperative alliance rather than through a newly emerged rural land market. We also find that the nature of leasing out farmland is markedly different to leasing in farmland. Where it occurs, the leasing out of land tends to be organised and formalised, and is tied to state developmentalist goals, particularly poverty alleviation. The leasing in of land is more widespread and occurs on an informal basis. Our analysis highlights key conditions that determine uneven land transfer and confirms that local political-economic dynamics complicate the realisation of central government directives on the ground.

T1  - PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY OF MAJOR CROPS AMONG SMALLHOLDER FARMERS IN CENTRAL ETHIOPIA
AN  - 2583589041
AB  - Agricultural production of most smallholders in Ethiopia is dependent with recurrent rainfall resulted in production variations. Limited input availability and precarious environmental conditions determine smallholders' decisions on their production and the production efficiencies vary from farmer to farmer. This study was carried out with the aim of analyzing the technical, allocative and economic efficiencies of smallholder farmers in the production of major crops and their determinants in central Ethiopia, Oromia special zone surrounding Addis Ababa. Multistage sampling technique was employed to randomly and proportionally select 386 smallholders from ten PAs. Primary data were collected from smallholders through a semi structured questionnaire using face to face interview. Cross sectional data collected from sampled households in the study area were analyzed using mathematical and econometric methods. Mathematical programming technique selected for this study was Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) using linear programming technique assuming multi-input and multi-outputs were handled. Tobit regression model was regressed against the socioeconomic, demographic, and institutional variables that are expected to affect the technical, allocative and economic efficiencies of sampled households. The results of estimated efficiency scores show the mean technical, allocative and economic efficiencies were 0.75, 0.60 and 0.45 respectively. The mean scores of efficiencies show underutilization of resources and the possibilities of smallholders to increase their agricultural production by 25%, and reduce cost of production by 40% and total cost by 55%. Marital status, level of education, farming experience, access to credit, cooperative membership, access to farming information, and off/non-farm income has positive influence on the technical, allocative and economic efficiencies. While age of the household head, access to training and livestock size has negative relations to efficiencies. Delivery of agricultural inputs and trainings on time by the government is the key policy implication to improve the efficiencies of smallholders.

T1  - The effect of membership in producer organizations on women's empowerment: Evidence from Kenya
AN  - 2562562909; 2021-65805-001
AB  - In developing countries, producer organizations (POs) are important for achieving women empowerment mainly through promoting women's access to the organization's resources and services. However, by improving access to markets and technologies, household membership in POs often results in commercialization of smallholder farming, leading to women disempowerment as men take over control of the farm. We use data from dairy smallholders in Kenya to explore the impact of membership in bargaining and processing POs on women empowerment. Applying the Women Empowerment Livestock Index, we capture six domains of empowerment: production; nutrition; resources; income; opportunities; and workload. We find that when a household joins any PO, regardless of whether the man or the woman in the household is the registered member, women achieve a higher control over production decisions, buying and selling of land and cows, use of loans and receiving dairy income. Distinguishing by gender of membership, there is stronger women empowerment when the woman in the household is a member. We also find that woman membership in bargaining POs results in greater empowerment, in terms of ownership of cows, than woman membership in processing POs. The paper suggests that women empowerment is affected by the functional characteristics of POs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Smallholder Farmers’ Dissatisfaction with Contract Schemes in Spite of Economic Benefits: Issues of Mistrust and Lack of Transparency
AN  - 2537026872
AB  - Contract farming is typically seen as a useful mechanism to help smallholders in overcoming market access constraints. However, in spite of economic benefits, high smallholder dropout rates from contract schemes are commonplace. We use quantitative and qualitative data from Ghana to show that smallholder farmers benefit from a resource-providing contract in terms of higher yields and incomes, but that most of them still regret their decision to participate in the contract scheme and would prefer to exit if they could. The analysis underlines that research focusing on narrowly defined economic indicators alone cannot explain farmers’ satisfaction with contracts and their dropout behaviour. The main problem in the contract scheme is insufficient information provided by the company. Farmers do not understand all the contract details, which leads to substantial mistrust. Farmers believe that the company behaves opportunistically, for instance during the output weighing procedure, and these beliefs are significantly correlated with the farmers’ wish to exit. We conclude that issues of mistrust and lack of transparency can contribute to breakdowns of smallholder contract schemes and that such issues should receive more attention in future research on contract farming.

T1  - Comparative analysis of carbon footprint between conventional smallholder operation and innovative largescale farming of urban agriculture in Beijing, China
AN  - 2546393593
AB  - The sustainable development of agriculture is one of the key issues of ensuring food security and mitigating climate change. Since innovative large-scale agriculture is gaining popularity in cities in China, where the agricultural landscape is dominated by conventional smallholder farming, it is necessary to investigate the difference in carbon emissions between conventional smallholder operation and innovative largescale agriculture. This study evaluated the carbon footprint (CF) of conventional and innovative urban agriculture in Beijing using the cradle-to-consumption Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Two modes of greenhouse vegetable and fruit production were analyzed and compared respectively: conventional smallholder operated vegetable farms that sell in local markets versus largescale home-delivery agriculture (HDA) that deliver vegetables to consumers’ home directly, conventional smallholder operated fruit farms that sell in farm shops versus largescale pick-your-own (PYO) initiatives. Results showed that HDA and PYO can reduce CF per area in on-farm cultivation compared to smallholder operation, while may bring an increase in CF per product weight unit and the gap was wider if the supply chain was considered. This is mainly because innovative large-scale farming consumes fewer agricultural inputs (e.g., fertilizer, pesticides) and obtains lower yields than conventional smallholder operations. Plastic materials with high carbon emission, fossil energy dependence and transportation efficiency are CF hotspots of both modes and therefore can be prioritized and targeted for carbon reduction adjustment. The results of this work further advance understanding of how innovative largescale agriculture and conventional smallholder operation compare and which particular inputs and activities should be prioritized to effectively reduce the CF in China during agricultural transformation.

T1  - Globalization, Climate Change and Uneven Development in Africa: The Zimbabwe Farmers Experience
AN  - 2610959103
AB  - The twin processes of climate change and globalisation coincided with radical land reform in the post land reform process in Zimbabwe to present a threat for smallholders' accumulation and inclusive agrarian relations. This paper identifies the nexus of climate change resilience and smallholders' accumulation under globalised agro-industrialising production where contract tobacco farming now predominates. The article assesses the shift in farming systems in response to global commodity circuits' demands, often unaligned to climatic change and rising risks associated with emerging resilience patterns. Using participatory research methods in Mvurwi area, 20 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) and eight focus group discussions were administered in 2020. The paper reveals that smallholders are adversely incorporated into the production of climate change risk crops but continue to participate in the production of the crops to earn foreign exchange and cash-based income. This promotes extroverted agricultural commodity production, avoiding indigenous droughtresistant and viable food crops. Participation in tobacco contract farming poses risks to the environment from excessive cutting down of trees for curing, but also because of the conversion of newly resettled and communal landowners into 'disguised and underpaid workers' for global capital, itself responsible for the initial environmental harm and uneven development. These findings reveal the risk associated with internationalised production systems, where due to globalisation, relevant and oftentimes indigenous farming systems and crops are discontinued. The paper concludes that the escalating risks associated with climate change require smallholders to embrace climate change resilience techniques through the adoption of new farming systems for sustainable food sovereignty, accumulation and inclusive agrarian relations.

T1  - DETERMINANTS OF SMALLHOLDER FARMER DECISION TO PARTICIPATE IN MILK AND BUTTER MARKET IN ADA'A BERGA DISTRICT, WEST SHEWA ZONE, ETHIOPIA *
AN  - 2576703420
AB  - The main objective of this study was to examine smallholder farmers' milk and butter market participation decision and level of participation in the Ada'a Berga district. A multi-stage sampling technique employed to select 123 respondents. Heckman two stage model was used. The result of the Heckamn first stage show that breed type, income from dairy, membership of dairy cooperative and milking cows have a positive and statistically significant effect on milk market participation. While, the distance from market, number milking cows, market information and non-dairy income has a positive and statistically significant effect on the farmers' decision to participate in the butter market. The second stage Heckman model result shows education, number milking cows, credit and membership of dairy cooperative have a positive and statistically significant effect on the level of milk market participation. Also, factors such as number milking cows, access to credit, dairy income and volume of milk produced have a positive and statistically significant effect on level of butter market participation. Therefore, improving breeding, education, market information, strengthening cooperative and extension and credit service can increase farmers' participation in output market.

T1  - Resisting a “Digital Green Revolution”: Agri-logistics, India’s New Farm Laws and the Regional Politics of Protest
AN  - 2555493680
AB  - Recent laws introduced by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government aim to centralise India’s federal structure, for the goal of a unified (Hindu) national market, and to corporatise its agro-food system at the expense of smallholder farming and small-scale trade. These laws are being challenged by mass mobilisations led by farmers’ unions from northwestern states—once-booming agricultural regions where, in recent decades and in the aftershocks of the Green Revolution, agrarian suicides have become endemic. The roots of this catastrophe are rapid marketisation in the 1960s (installing monocropping dependent on petrochemical inputs, destroying local agroecology) followed by post-1980s neoliberalism (with highly inequitable contract farming, alongside defunding of public infrastructure). Farmers and labourers now face interwoven crises of social reproduction—ecological depletion, precarisation, and chronic indebtedness, with no post-agricultural future in sight. The new laws claim to redress this by employing populist rhetoric against “exploitative middlemen”; in reality, markets are re-regulated in favour of large export-oriented agribusiness, thereby endangering food security, livelihoods and climate. The laws also herald digitalisation in agriculture and retail—further subsuming smallholders into productivist, financialised and outsourced logics. Their promulgation has triggered substantial FDI from global Big Tech, including Facebook and Google, aided by Indian conglomerates with close ties to the BJP built during PM Narendra Modi’s prior tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat. This paper details the above and concludes by contextualising the ongoing protest movement. We focus on southern Punjab, a region that has suffered acute crises of health and ecology, as well as violent political conflict and state repression. Decades of left-wing rural union activity in this region, fighting debt and dispossession as well as in support of anticaste land struggles, have laid the organisational groundwork for hopeful new political trajectories, including potentials for grassroots red-green coalitions centring women and landless labourers.

T1  - A gross margin analysis for Nguni cattle farmers in Limpopo Province, South Africa
AN  - 2544865325
AB  - Factors such as increases in population, urbanization, growth in per capita income and changes in consumer taste and preferences are causing gradual increases in livestock product consumption and demand. South Africa is addressing this predicted increase in livestock products demand by commercializing smallholder livestock producers. The Limpopo Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) Nguni Cattle Development Project is an example of such effort. The economic performance of these efforts needs to be evaluated. We use gross margin analysis to evaluate the performance of the Limpopo IDC Nguni Cattle Development Project. Additionally, we use regression analysis to identify factors influencing gross margins. Our results indicate that although smallholders show potential to commercialize, they lack commercial farming experience and require that a strong extension support system be used as one of the strategies to improve profitability. We also noted that individual farmers were more profitable than group farmers. Multiple regression analysis shows that three variables could be used to stimulate gross margin among the Limpopo IDC Nguni Cattle Development Project farmers. These are herd size, distance to market and farm size. Since farm size is a given, policy should focus on assisting farmers to build their herds and to have better access to markets.

T1  - Estimating effects of cooperative membership on farmers’ safe production behaviors: evidence from the rice sector in China
AN  - 2532439179
AB  - The current agricultural system in China highly depends on chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Consequently, agricultural production activities cause various environmental issues. Carrying out safe production provides vital support for sustainable development of agriculture, which may improve this situation. The past decades have witnessed the fast development of rural cooperatives organization in China. Given the fact that rural cooperative organization plays a crucial role in agricultural production, however, there is little empirical evidence on the relationship between cooperative membership and safe production of smallholders in China. This study aims to investigate whether the participation in farmer cooperatives contributes to safe production in agriculture in China. Using survey data covering 623 rice-producing farm households in Sichuan province in China, this study employs the endogenous switching regression model to examine the effects of the participation in farmer cooperatives on safe production in rice agriculture. The results show that cooperative membership has significantly positive effects on safe production in rice agriculture. In particular, the average treatment effects demonstrate that without the participation in cooperatives, the members’ adoption of the green control techniques would reduce by 74.491%, the application of artificial weeding would reduce by 38.768%, and organic fertilizer input would reduce by 23.448%. Furthermore, the marginal treatment effect is employed to evaluate the heterogeneous effects of the participation in farmer cooperatives on safe production in rice agriculture. Heterogeneous effect analyses suggest that farmers who are more likely to participate in farmer cooperatives are easier to adopt green control technology, while farmers who are less likely to participate in farmer cooperatives are easier to adopt artificial weeding and increase organic fertilizer input. To improve safe production in rice agriculture, the Chinese government is expected to encourage rice farmers to participate in rural cooperative organizations, and to stimulate rice farmers to take collective action to address environment issues arising from agricultural production.

T1  - The design of fresh fruit bunch palm oil purchase system from independent smallholders to support Indonesia’s biodiesel development program
AN  - 2528497007
AB  - Miniplants established by the independent smallholder’s secondary cooperative is one of the efforts to get rid from monopsony market and mill. By the existence of miniplants, Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) sales channel will not only end at mill, but also at the miniplant in spite of in limited capacity. Each channel of FFB sales should be supported by the credible price information and the integrated purchase system. To fulfill the need of real-time & transparent price information and the integrated FFB purchase system can be realized by developing mobile application Software as a Service (SaaS) of FFB’s purchase based on a cloud platform. The method used to develop the mobile application is a system approach following the stages in SDLC (System Development Life Cycle) starting from the ideas, user requirements, system requirements, designing, deployment and maintenance. This study is restricted until the stage of designing and generating Business Process Diagram, Use Case Diagram, Data Conceptual Model and Mock up only. Both diagram and model generated in this study aids develop FFB purchase mobile application. The large number of independent smallholders has the opportunity to get a large number of mobile application users. The application will generate a large amount of data. These data can be used to develop various tools as part of the FFB e-procurement system to ensure the supply of independent smallholders’ FFB can be used for biodiesel development programs as expected by the government of Indonesia.

T1  - Quality versus solidarity: Third Wave coffee and cooperative values among smallholding Maya farmers in Guatemala
AN  - 2518072825
AB  - This article examines how a market shift toward high-end (‘Third Wave') coffee creates tension between two producer models of economic engagement: cooperatives, with mechanisms that promote solidarity to minimize risks, and ‘open’ markets, with extraordinary rewards for those able to grow the highest quality coffees. Most Maya farmers value cooperative organization and yet a growing number are defecting, unable to forgo the premiums intermediaries offer for their best beans. This is a complicated moral and economic situation in which the Third Wave focus on single-origin coffees forces changes in relations of production that undermine the cooperative preferences of smallholding farmers.

T1  - Insured Loans and Credit Access: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment in Northern Ghana
AN  - 2511817039
AB  - We conducted a two‐treatment randomized control trial in northern Ghana to investigate how bundling index insurance with agricultural loans affects smallholder access to credit. In one treatment, farmer groups were invited to apply for production loans bundled with an index insurance contract that, in the event of a drought, indemnifies farmers directly (micro‐insured loans). In the second treatment, farmer groups were invited to apply for production loans bundled with an index insurance contract that, in the event of a drought, indemnifies the lender on the condition that the indemnity be used to retire the farmer's debt obligation (meso‐insured loans). Farmer groups in the control category were invited to apply for uninsured loans. We find that insured loans increase farmers' likelihood of receiving credit by between 15 and 21 percentage points. Exploring the mechanisms of this effect, we find no impact on the likelihood that farmers apply for credit but do find an increase in the likelihood of loan approvals of between 17 and 25 percentage points.

T1  - Land Reform and Postcolonial Poverty in South Korea, 1950-1970
AN  - 2598666815
AB  - This study aims to incorporate sociocultural and everyday life historical perspectives into the existing research on South Korean land reform. It seeks to position the excluded voices of farmers into the narrative of economic history and, by doing so, examines the possibility of comparative studies of land reform within the politics of Cold War developmentalism. South Korean land reform in 1950 transformed most tenant farmers into independent small farm owners. Tenant farmers attained their long-held desire to own land, but individual farm management left them in a precarious state. Disconnected from organized labor as well as from landlords' financial support, small-landed farmers began to suffer from the effects of low household income and a chronic lack of operating funds. To make matters worse, under the Syngman Rhee government, post-Korean War rehabilitation focused on fostering manufacturing while controlling inflation through intervention in the agricultural sector. In time, agrarian poverty led to a rural exodus, with the population of farm households dipping below 50 percent for the first time in 1969. In part because of these rapid shifts in population and production, the problems of a contracting agricultural sector were reduced to the problems of an expanding manufacturing sector. This context framed the South Korean government's decision to initiate the New Village Movement under the slogan of rural modernization.

T1  - Farmer preferences in contracting with modern retail in Indonesia: A choice experiment
AN  - 2510184105
AB  - Understanding the preferences of smallholder farmers for contracting can help in making contracts more sustainable. This paper presents the results of a choice experiment (CE) among smallholder farmers in Indonesia to assess their preferences for accepting contracts with modern retail. The CE was based on attributes of actual sales transactions in modern retail and traditional retail channels. A total of 301 vegetable smallholder farmers participated, consisting of 173 farmers participating in traditional markets and 128 in modern retail markets. A random parameter logit model estimates that, in general, smallholders do not prefer contracting with modern retail over spot market selling in traditional retail channels. Most contract attributes are perceived as negative by smallholders. A willingness‐to‐accept analysis shows that farmers are critical of most contract attributes, particularly those related to quality requirements. Producer organizations (POs) reduce transaction costs and increase smallholders' preference toward contracts. Contract designs that reduce transaction cost, mitigate risks for farmers, provide fair prices, and involve POs are more likely to attract smallholders to modern retail channels.

T1  - Growth of Agricultural Labourers in West Bengal with Special Reference to Uttar Dinajpur District since Independence
AN  - 2546152723
AB  - Agricultural Labourers from the poorest section of the rural population in India as well as in West Bengal. In numerical terms, they constitute about one-fourth of the total work force. Their number has been rising faster than the rate of growth of rural population. By the term agricultural labourers we mean a person who sells his/her labour power to work to another person's land for wages in money, kind or a share of the crop. According to the 1991 Census definition, "a person who works on another person's land for wages - in money, kind or share of crop is regarded as an agricultural labourer. He or she has no risk in cultivation, but merely works on another person's land for wages. An agricultural labourer has no right of lease or contract on the land on which he or she works". (Census of India, 1991, paper - III of 1991, p. 6). Thus the Census definition clearly excludes tenants as well as marginal farmers and includes only landless labourers. The definition adopted by us would be broader in the sense that it would include all those for whom sale of labour power in the agricultural sector is a source of livelihood. At the dawn of independence, the economy of West Bengal was characterized not only by a high percentage of landless agricultural labourers in its rural work force but also by a sizeable class of marginal holding peasants. This paper tries to inquire in some detail the causes of the high rate of growth of agricultural labourers in West Bengal as well in the district of Uttar Dinajpur..

T1  - Digitization of Sustainable Smallholder Oil Palm Plantations Towards Modern Oil Palm Cooperatives
AN  - 2512953069
AB  - Based on palm oil producers in Indonesia, private plantations are the largest national producers (54%), followed by smallholders (39%) and state-owned plantations (7%). In managing smallholder oil palm still have limited access to technology, production facilities, institutions, and marketing. With the system of digitizing sustainable smallholder, it is designed to transform the business processes carried out by oil palm farmers who join cooperatives into digital work patterns while still providing a permanent role and appreciation for their work from farmers and for farmers. The research was carried out in the KUD Tunas Muda, Teluk Merbau Village, Dayun District, Siak Regency, Riau Province, and was planned for three years. In the first year, the research objectives were to socialize the digital system; identification of smallholder oil palm plantation production factors; and record assistance in the implementation of input-output. The socialization activities showed that most farmers (80%) were very enthusiastic about this program. Farmers understand the factors that affect FFB production. Assistance in recording the implementation of inputs and outputs for smallholders is carried out to representatives of farmer groups using laptops or computers.

T1  - Selling Together: The Benefits of Cooperatives to Women Honey Producers in Ethiopia
AN  - 2475287972
AB  - Smallholder farmers in developing countries encounter multiple barriers in access to inputs and technology, which prevent them from reaping the benefits from market participation. Women farmers face additional constraints due to gender norms that further limit their engagement in productive activities. While collective action has been shown to improve access to markets and economic outcomes for farmers overall, the evidence on the effects of cooperative membership for women smallholders remains limited. We investigate empirically the economic benefits of collective action for women farmers in the honey sector in Ethiopia. Relying on a rich data set on women honey producers, both cooperative members and non‐members, we evaluate the effects of belonging to a cooperative on three outcome variables through coarsened exact matching and regression analysis. Our results indicate that cooperative membership significantly increases the market price and the production quantity and, while the average effect on the share of product marketed is statistically insignificant, significant differences emerge for women with given characteristics. These results are shown to be robust to a number of tests that address biases from selection on observables and unobservables. An analysis of the heterogeneous effects of household membership in multiple groups finds that membership of self‐help groups or farmer associations amplifies the positive outcomes from belonging to a formal cooperative. Finally, qualitative findings derived from the same communities indicate self‐reported improvements in agency and self‐esteem among women members, thus reinforcing the importance of the quantitative findings.

T1  - Entre vulnérabilité et résilience : le vécu de la pandémie de Covid-19 dans deux sociétés oasiennes du Maghreb
AN  - 2615617195
AB  - À partir de la mi-mars 2020, les gouvernements algérien et marocain ont instauré un confinement pour lutter contre la propagation de la pandémie de Covid-19. Cela s’est traduit par la fermeture des marchés locaux et des restrictions de mobilité. Le traitement médiatique et scientifique de l’impact de la pandémie a porté principalement sur les zones urbaines, laissant de côté les expériences des ruraux alors même que les mesures restrictives sont arrivées en pleine campagne agricole. Cet article vise à combler partiellement cette lacune en analysant comment les petits agriculteurs, femmes et hommes des oasis et des extensions oasiennes, les jeunes producteurs et les ouvriers de deux régions oasiennes du Maghreb, ont vécu ces nouveaux défis. Pour ce faire, nous nous appuyons sur 150 entretiens téléphoniques menés avec des acteurs ruraux dans les vallées du Drâa (Maroc) et du M’zab (Algérie). En mettant leurs expériences au cœur de notre analyse, nous montrons comment la crise sanitaire a limité la capacité de la majorité des petits agriculteurs à écouler leur production agricole, et comment elle a mis à l’épreuve la pluriactivité des familles oasiennes, les rendant ainsi plus vulnérables. Puis, nous décrivons comment ces acteurs ont développé différentes pratiques de résilience, individuelles et collectives, comme la mise en place d’un marché du travail virtuel pour remplacer les traditionnels moquefs (places de recrutement des ouvriers), la transition vers des pratiques agroécologiques, la réinvention de la solidarité et de l’action collective.Alternate abstract:
From mid-March 2020 onwards, the Algerian and Moroccan governments instituted a lockdown to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in the closure of local markets and mobility restrictions. Even though these measures were implemented halfway through the agricultural year, the media and scientific coverage of the impact of the pandemic focused mainly on urban areas, leaving aside the experiences of rural people. This article aims to partially fill this gap by analysing how smallholder farmers, women and men, young producers, and workers in two oasis regions in the Maghreb, experienced these new challenges. To do so, we rely on 150 phone interviews conducted with rural actors in the Drâa Valley (Morocco) and the M’zab Valley (Algeria). By putting their experiences at the heart of our analysis, we show how the health crisis has put constraints on the ability of the majority of smallholder farmers to sell their products and how it has put a strain on the various activities of oasis families, making them more vulnerable. Then, we illustrate how these actors developed different individual and collective resilience practices, through the establishment of a virtual labor market to replace the traditional moquefs (places of recruitment of workers), the adoption of agroecological practices, and the reinvention of solidarity and collective action.

T1  - Member commitment in agricultural cooperatives: Evidence from Ethiopia
AN  - 2614940089
AB  - Member commitment is essential for the efficiency and survival of member-based economic organizations like agricultural cooperatives. In Ethiopia, cooperatives are considered as important vehicles for linking smallholder farmers to markets and for rural development more generally. However, member commitment in cooperatives is not self-evident. Different scholars confirm that there is a decline in commitment of members to their cooperative. Consequently, it is important to identify what factors drive this decline to enhance member commitment and promote the performance of cooperatives. Thus, this paper seeks to explore the determinants of member commitment. Our empirical analysis is based on a 2014 survey among 240 members of agricultural cooperatives in Ethiopia. This paper makes two contributions to the academic body of knowledge on member commitment in agricultural cooperatives. First, it distinguishes between three elements of commitment: loyalty, identification and participation. By exploring the determinants of each element of commitment, we obtain a much richer picture of what drives members. Second, we make a distinction between multipurpose cooperatives and specialized marketing cooperatives. The study has important implications for policy makers, government and stakeholders of cooperatives for devising appropriate interventions that could enhance the commitment of members in agricultural cooperatives.

T1  - Structure conduct and performance of dairy market in Ada’a Berga district, Ethiopia
AN  - 2614940048
AB  - The aim of this article was to investigate SCP of milk and butter market in Ada’a Berga District using SCP model. Primary data collected from randomly selected 123 smallholder farmers, 48 traders and 30 consumers were used to calculate the gross margin, concentration ratio(CR), regulation of market entry and exit and market conduct. The CR results showed that top four milk traders controlled 78.8% and 89.54% of the total volume of milk sold in Ada’a Berga and Holeta, respectively, and 61.29% and 63.46% butter sold in Ada’a Berga and Holeta, respectively. The CR of milk and butter markets were strongly oligopolistic. Education, market transparency and capital, political equality, corruption were barrier to entry milk and butter trade. The conduct analysis results showed that farmers use different markets outlets and price setting strategies to sell dairy products. The result of pricing setting was not competitive as 51.67% dairy price decisions were decided by buyers. In milk marketing, the maximum total gross marketing margin of producers share was 63.15% in channel III (producer, district retailer to consumers). The maximum producer’s share in butter market was in channel V (producer, district retailer to consumers). Therefore, strengthening institutions that convey reliable and timely market information; support dairy market, improving collective action of farmers, address the challenges of financial access to smallholder farmers and traders to decrease oligopolistic nature of the market. Moreover, give attention to market infrastructural, training and yield increasing technologies in the study area to improvement production and marketing of dairy products.

T1  - Price risk perceptions and adoption of management strategies by smallholder rice farmers in Mbeya region, Tanzania
AN  - 2614934657
AB  - One of the main risks that tend to affect the profitability and well-being of smallholder rice farmers in Tanzania is volatile rice prices. Improving the capacity of farmers to manage price risks is essential to increase rural incomes. This article applies descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, and probit model to examine price risk management strategies of smallholders rice farmers, and factors affecting their use. Results have shown that most rice farmers prefer to manage price risk through spot market strategies, even though forward contracts perform better. The factors that significantly affected the adoption of the risk management tools were farm income, technological intensity, income diversification activities, access to market information, and storage facilities. Findings suggest that policies aimed at establishing and promoting commodity- derivative markets, improving market information systems, supporting the construction of warehouse facilities in rural areas, and improving access to credit for farmers could enhance farmers’ ability to manage price risks. Governments can also set up price guarantee schemes to help farmers cope with the loss of income resulting from catastrophic events or major market disruptions.

T1  - Sustainability of centralized contract farming among tobacco smallholder farmers in Makoni North District, Zimbabwe
AN  - 2614518777
AB  - The study explores centralized contract farming sustainability among tobacco smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe. Despite studies on centralized contract farming to date, little has been theorized with regard to its sustainability. Using mixed-method research, questionnaires, key informant interviews, document review and focus group discussions were employed in gathering data from farmers, Extension Officers and field officers of the contracting firms. Using Pearson Correlation Coefficient and thematic analysis findings revealed that centralized contract tobacco farming is unsustainable. Institutional contract arrangements are manipulative and are unwelcome to farmers. Economically, contracting firms find it viable as they obtain more profit at the expense of smallholder farmers. Although farmers are assured of inputs, extension service and market for the product, the contract terms are characterized by transaction cost, uncertainty and information asymmetry. Moreso, although financial and physical assets ownership have been increased, human, natural and social capital are a challenge. Shocks, stresses and seasonality still characterize the vulnerability context of the farmers as society has been exposed to women and child abuses, food insecurity, and social decay. The study therefore recommends an increased participatory action and learning in crafting and implementing contract terms by farmers, state and non-state actors for sustainability to be realized.

T1  - Economic Implications of Smallholders’ Collaborative Groupings on Household Income and Adaptability to Climate Change in Nigeria
AN  - 2612849112
AB  - This study assessed the impact of smallholders’ collaborative groupings on farm household income and their decision to adapt management strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change within their farming areas. A sample of 225 households’ farms from the participating 15 LGAs in Ondo State were randomly selected. However, only 200 questionnaires were properly filled and returned. The study deployed both descriptive and inferential statistics (t-test and regression models) to achieve its objectives. The study found that only 20% of the households have strategies to ensure a smooth succession of the management in the family farm. The results of the probit regression analysis showed that the membership of collaborative groupings significantly and positively influenced the per capita household farm income and households’ decision to adapt management strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change. In addition, findings from the study also empirically validated that farmers who adapted to the climate earned a higher farm income than non-adapters. On the strength of these findings, the study recommends that more farmers should be encouraged to form collaborative groupings where they can also share in the numerous benefits of being in such a network, including the access to more information on adaptation to climate change.

T1  - Quantitative Analysis of Farmers Perception of the Constraints to Sunflower Production: A Transverse Study Approach Using Hierarchical Logistic Model (HLM)
AN  - 2608150429
AB  - Sunflower production is an excellent choice for both local and national agribusiness with significant potential in smallholder farming systems due to low input costs, consistent yields, and a short planting window. However, farmers are faced with interrelated constraints in their sunflower production. This study was undertaken to examines the perceptions of the constraints to sunflower production as perceived by smallholder farmers in North West Province, South Africa. The research identifies some factors related to sunflower production constraints. Then, a stratified random sampling technique was used to select 172 sunflower farmers and they were asked to rate their response on these attributes on a 5-points Likert scale. Leveraging principal component analysis (PCA), we agglomerated and condense information from the original datasets of the constraint attributes into three main components (innovation, farm finance, and crop management practice). Because of the hierarchical structure of the dataset with farmers nested within their local municipalities, we use Hierarchical Logistic Modeling techniques to identify the factors that determine farmer’s perceived interest in innovation, farm finance, and crop management practices. Innovation and farm finance emerge to be critical elements for sustainable sunflower production. The findings indicate that age, education, household size, farm size, cooperative membership, and gender are strongly correlated with farmers’ perceived interest in innovation and farm finance characteristics. This study recommends that to promote these elements among smallholder farmers, it is necessary for governments at the local and national level to invest in extension service and education, cooperative organizations, research, and development in disentangling the age, gender, and farm size inequalities existing in the district sunflower production.

T1  - Land Cover and Land Use Change Decreases Net Ecosystem Production in Tropical Peatlands of West Kalimantan, Indonesia
AN  - 2602049361
AB  - Deforested and converted tropical peat swamp forests are susceptible to fires and are a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, information on the influence of land-use change (LUC) on the carbon dynamics in these disturbed peat forests is limited. This study aimed to quantify soil respiration (heterotrophic and autotrophic), net primary production (NPP), and net ecosystem production (NEP) in peat swamp forests, partially logged forests, early seral grasslands (deforested peat), and smallholder-oil palm estates (converted peat). Peat swamp forests (PSF) showed similar soil respiration with logged forests (LPSF) and oil palm (OP) estates (37.7 Mg CO2 ha−1 yr−1, 40.7 Mg CO2 ha−1 yr−1, and 38.7 Mg CO2 ha−1 yr−1, respectively), but higher than early seral (ES) grassland sites (30.7 Mg CO2 ha−1 yr−1). NPP of intact peat forests (13.2 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) was significantly greater than LPSF (11.1 Mg C ha−1 yr−1), ES (10.8 Mg C ha−1 yr−1), and OP (3.7 Mg C ha−1 yr−1). Peat swamp forests and seral grasslands were net carbon sinks (10.8 Mg CO2 ha−1 yr−1 and 9.1 CO2 ha−1 yr−1, respectively). In contrast, logged forests and oil palm estates were net carbon sources; they had negative mean Net Ecosystem Production (NEP) values (−0.1 Mg CO2 ha−1 yr−1 and −25.1 Mg CO2 ha−1 yr−1, respectively). The shift from carbon sinks to sources associated with land-use change was principally due to a decreased Net Primary Production (NPP) rather than increased soil respiration. Conservation of the remaining peat swamp forests and rehabilitation of deforested peatlands are crucial in GHG emission reduction programs.

T1  - Share Contract Revisited: A New Transaction Cost Approach
AN  - 2584364214
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore how sharecropping contracts are chosen over fixed-rent contracts. There are two concerning issues. First, theoretical explanation has been criticized for not providing a satisfactory answer to the question as to why share contracts are chosen. Second, among the existing empirical studies, there are great controversies about the impact of variance of output. Inspired by the latest insights from (Cheung, S. N. S. 2014. Economic Explanation. Hong Kong: Arcadia Press.), this paper not only provides an explanation for the choice of share contract that is suitable for empirical testing, but also solves the puzzle over variance of output.

T1  - The legacy of traditional rice cultivation by descendants of Indian contract laborers in Suriname
AN  - 2583028846
AB  - Background 
Some 35,000 indentured laborers from India were recruited to work on plantations in Suriname between 1868 and 1916. It is likely that most were familiar with farming before they were shipped to this former Dutch colony in the Caribbean. Around 1900, those who did not return received a piece of land where most of them started growing rice as a staple crop. Agronomists characterized their traditional landraces as inferior and infested with weedy rice and started to ‘purify’ these landraces. No research has been done on whether these ancient rice varieties still exist. We aimed to document the rice varieties (both landraces and more modern cultivars) grown currently or in the recent past by (descendants of) Hindustani smallholders in Suriname, their origin, morphological and agronomic characters, local uses and cultural and spiritual relevance. Given the rapid decline in small-scale rice cultivation in the past 40 years, we wanted to know why people continued or abandoned rice farming and what aspects of traditional practices still survived.
 Methods 
We interviewed 26 (former) small-scale Hindustani farmers and asked about the varieties they cultivated and traditional agricultural practices. We collected seed samples, local names and associated information, and compared these to information from agricultural reports from the colonial period. We also interviewed 11 Maroons, one Javanese farmer, and three persons of mixed ethnicity, who were somehow involved in the cultivation of East Indian rice varieties.
 Results and discussion 
Hindustani smallholders in Suriname largely lost their traditional rice landraces. Most of the interviewed farmers grew modern cultivars, developed after 2000. Some cultivars from the 1950s were still planted for fodder, but these were heavily mixed with weedy rice and other weeds. Maroon farmers in the interior, however, still actively cultivated varieties with names like ‘coolie rice’, which probably descend from landraces introduced by the Indian contract laborers, although this needs to be confirmed by molecular research. Although traditional cultivation practices seem to have been lost, smallholders still retain pleasant memories of the manual planting, harvesting, and processing of rice, as well as the gender-based practices and beliefs associated with the cultivation of the crop. The oral history of former rice farmers and traditional rice varieties (possibly obtained from Maroon fields) could play a role in museum settings as living vehicles for memories of the descendants of Asian contract labourers in Suriname and Guyana.

T1  - Extended Urbanization through Capital Centralization: Contract Farming in Palm Oil-Based Agroindustrialization
AN  - 2576503623
AB  - The discussion on extended urbanization considers accumulation by dispossession as a key apparatus for instilling urban logic into predominantly rural areas. This paper contends that extended urbanization can also be produced without physical dispossession of community land. This is illustrated by the case study of Sei Mangkei, an emerging palm oil agroindustrial district in North Sumatra, Indonesia. Capitalist industries prefer monetization through contract farming rather than privatization as an instrument to capture the productivity of palm oil smallholder land. The people who serve as smallholders in the palm oil industry are not victims of land appropriation. Moreover, this situation was also triggered by an opportunity for maximizing the socio-economic welfare of smallholders. However, the limited options to access other economic activities when the commodity crisis occurred was a consequence that smallholders were not aware of in the past. Thus, we assert that extended urbanization was (re)produced through the articulation of socio-economic and cultural practices of smallholders on a local-scale with regard to the dynamics of the broader process of global industrialization.

T1  - Impact of Grain Subsidy Reform on the Land Use of Smallholder Farms: Evidence from Huang-Huai-Hai Plain in China
AN  - 2576450759
AB  - Smallholder farms have played an essential role in agricultural production and food security. In order to increase farm size, the Chinese government announced a reform of the grain subsidy program in 2015. Under the reform, 20% of the aggregate input subsidy, as well as the pilot subsidy to large-scale farmers and the incremental part of the agricultural support and protection subsidy budget, were used to support increasing farm size. This study evaluated the impact of China’s grain subsidy reform on the land use of smallholder farms to investigate whether the reform achieved its goal. Based on 2063 samples obtained from the 2013–2015 Survey for Agriculture and Village Economy data in Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, we conducted a difference-in-difference model to solve the problem of missing counterfactual states in policy evaluation. Farms from Henan and Shandong were assigned to the treatment group, and farms from Hebei were assigned to the control group. The results revealed that the average treatment effect on the treated of the impact of the grain subsidy reform on the wheat-sown area was −25% (0.10 ha). Furthermore, there was heterogeneity in regard to the subsidy reform effects in different sown-area groups. The reform had the most significant impact on the smallest farmers. We also found that China’s grain subsidy reform had a significant and positive effect on the amount of outflow land area, while the impact of subsidy reform on land tenure was insignificant. Our findings suggest that while encouraging large-scale farms, it is necessary to take into account farmers’ small-scale operations and gradually promote the transformation of small-scale operations to large-scale operations. The Chinese government should strengthen the supervision of land use to achieve the goal of ensuring food security.

T1  - Unpacking the Processes that Catalyzed the Adoption of Best Management Practices for Lowland Irrigated Rice in the Mekong Delta
AN  - 2576376898
AB  - Vietnam is supportive of the transition to sustainable rice production in the Mekong Delta. The national program promoted best management practices for rice production through “1 Must Do and 5 Reductions” (1M5R). This review traces the technological development and uptake of 1M5R in national policies and by end-users. We highlight the outcomes from various policy-supported initiatives and unpack plausible pathways that generated the widespread adoption of 1M5R in eight provinces in the Mekong River Delta: at least 104,448 smallholder rice farmers were reached, and 1M5R practices adopted on 113,870 hectares. The scaling of 1M5R was enabled through a convergence of different socio-technical systems with varied foci, including sustainability certification, contract farming, consolidation of production, and improved use of inputs, aside from the development of sustainable technologies. In addition, 1M5R was promoted with incentives generated by a World Bank project and other initiatives in line with a national policy of increasing the quality of rice production for national and international markets. The interconnections of varied socio-technical systems, enacted by different intermediaries, catalyzed the spread of 1M5R. The widespread adoption by smallholder farmers increased their profits and raised awareness across diverse stakeholder groups of the higher marketability of rice produced with sustainable practices.

T1  - Experiences from the Implementation of Community-Based Goat Breeding Programs in Malawi and Uganda: A Potential Approach for Conservation and Improvement of Indigenous Small Ruminants in Smallholder Farms
AN  - 2562206614
AB  - Maintaining diversity of small ruminant genetic resources is instrumental for sustainable agricultural production. Community-based livestock breeding programs (CBBPs) have emerged as a potential approach to implement breeding programs in smallholder farms. This study assesses the viability of CBBPs as a potential approach for conservation and improvement of indigenous small ruminants, using case studies of goat CBBPs in Malawi and Uganda. Data were collected using focus group discussions, personal interviews, and direct observations. The program promotes and empowers smallholders to have access to small ruminant feed resources through protection of existing communal pasturelands, capacity building in pasture production, and conservation of crop residues and crop by-products. Implementation of the CBBP enhances the contributions through improved animal growth performance, kids’ survival, and twinning rates leading to increased offtake rates and better prices. The existence of permanently established supporting organizations and other stakeholders provides sustainable institutional support instrumental for the establishment and growth of CBBPs. However, establishment of functional community-based institutions (producer cooperatives) and investments in institutional/policy reforms to safeguard fair trading, access to common resources by small ruminant keepers, and adoption of the CBBP model into national livestock development programs are some of the key milestones that can guarantee sustainability.

T1  - Livelihood Improvement through Agroforestry Compared to Conventional Farming System: Evidence from Northern Irrigated Plain, Pakistan
AN  - 2544890098
AB  - The concept of sustainable livelihood garnered a prominent status in humanitarian and international development organizations that aim to calculate and build a livelihood for agroforestry farmers. However, it is difficult to measure and analyze as well as visualize the data of livelihood improvement from agroforestry (AF). This paper comparatively assessed 400 smallholder farmers’ livelihood through AF and conventional farming (CF) systems in the Northern Irrigated Plain of Pakistan. The findings showed that AF has a mixed impact on farmers’ livelihood capital, including human, physical, natural, financial and social capital. Specifically, AF significantly improved financial capital in terms of timber, non-timber and fuel wood income. Furthermore, the physical capital (buffalo plough, generators and sprinklers), natural capital (the extent of cultivated land and land ownership; the number of households (HHs) growing vegetables, fruit crops and medicinal crops) and social capital (the number of social groups that HHs involved and number of HHs sharing crop seeds) of AF farmer HHs were significantly improved compared to those of CF farmers. However, the results show that financial capital gain through crop income, HHs owning high-value vehicles (tractors) and farmers trust and collective activities were significantly higher in CF farmers than AF ones. Therefore, to enhance the contribution of AF to rural livelihood, advanced extension services and government involvement on research planning and implementing are needed.

T1  - Climate Change Perceptions by Smallholder Coffee Farmers in the Northern and Southern Highlands of Tanzania
AN  - 2544676695
AB  - Smallholder farmers are among the most vulnerable groups to climate change. Efforts to enhance farmers’ adaptation to climate change are hindered by lack of information on how they are experiencing and responding to climate change. Therefore, this paper examines smallholder farmers’ perceptions of climate change, factors influencing their perceptions, and the impacts and adaptation strategies adopted over the past three to four decades. A list of farmers was obtained from the Agricultural Marketing Cooperative Society (AMCOS) and filtered on the basis of age and farming experience. In order to explore factors influencing household perceptions of climate change, a structured questionnaire was administered to the randomly selected household heads. Data on rainfall and temperature were acquired from Lyamungo and Burka Coffee estate (Northern Highlands zone) and Mbimba and Mbinga (Southern Highlands zone) offices of the Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA) with the exception of data from Burka Coffee estate, which were acquired from a private operator. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to analyze the data. Farmers’ perceptions were consistent with meteorological data both pointing to significant decline in rainfall and increase in temperature since 1979. Factors such as level of education, farming experience, and access to climate information influenced farmers’ perception on climate change aspects. Based on these results, it is recommended to enhance timely and accurate weather information delivery along with developing institutions responsible for education and extension services provision. The focus of education or training should be on attenuating the impacts of climate change through relevant adaptation measures in each coffee-growing region.

T1  - Assessing sustainability factors of farmer seed production: a case of the Good Seed Initiative project in Tanzania
AN  - 2543523315
AB  - Background 
Quality seed is at the core of the technological packages needed to increase crop production, nutrition, and rural wellbeing. However, smallholder farmers in Tanzania have limited access to affordable quality seeds, and over 90% of seed sown is saved by farmers from previous harvests, though its quality is often poor. The Good Seed Initiative (GSI) aimed to enhance access to quality African indigenous vegetable (AIV) seed in Tanzania, through the promotion of farmer seed production, using two models—contract farming and Quality Declared Seed (QDS). This study assessed post-GSI project sustainability factors and explored the prospects for replicating the approach in a wider regional context.
 Methods 
The study was conducted in Arusha and Dodoma, targeting locations where the GSI project was implemented. Qualitative tools employing focus group discussions (73 men, 69 women), and key informant interviews were used for data collection.
 Results 
Farmer seed production under both models continued to thrive, creating avenues for income diversification and contributing over 50% to household incomes. Farmer seed production contributed to increased availability of quality seed for vegetable growers, especially in central Tanzania that is less served by the formal sector. However, QDS production was challenged by a lack of access to foundation seed, inspections, and seed testing services, which are key for quality seed production.
 Conclusions 
Results reveal unequivocally that farmer seed production offers a potentially sustainable solution to the problem of seed supply while providing income benefits for seed producers. The market-based approach used by the project and partnerships with the formal sector, coupled with stimulation of demand through nutritional awareness campaigns, were strong contributory factors to the survival of farmer seed production. Farmer-led seed systems, especially QDS, deserve support from the government to develop a tailored and appropriate seed system that meets the ever-evolving needs of smallholder farmers. Adoption gender-inclusive approaches, particularly in contract farming is paramount to benefit women as much as men.

T1  - Farmer-led participatory extension leads Haitian farmers to anticipate climate-related risks and adjust livelihood strategies
AN  - 2518777042
AB  - Farmers globally are facing challenges associated with climate variability and change. In Haiti, where agriculture is predominantly non-mechanized and rainfed, smallholder farmers are severely affected by reduced yields and increases in operating costs. We evaluate the Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture (PICSA) approach with farmers who live in mountainous areas outside of Port-au-Prince ahead of the 2019 spring growing season. We use quantitative surveys and qualitative case studies to measure farmers' understanding and use of PICSA information and tools, and perceived effects on their farming and households. Seventy percent of survey respondents (63% women) reported that training in PICSA led them to make positive changes in their farming and livelihood enterprises. While most of the changes pertained to the management of existing farming enterprises, farmers also made changes in scale and started new enterprises. The analysis of qualitative case studies provides an in-depth understanding of perceived benefits on farmers' income, food security, confidence and their attitudes towards farming and climate risk. PICSA builds farmers' self-efficacy by enabling them to focus and reflect on their individual context while collectively analyzing and interpreting relevant information on climate and livelihood options. This study has important implications for future adaptation interventions where extension services and climate information are limited.

T1  - Smallholder Coffee Productivity as Affected by Socioeconomic Factors and Technology Adoption
AN  - 2497887961
AB  - Despite the increase in area under coffee in Kenya in the last decade, productivity has been on the decline. Numerous production technologies have been developed through on-station research but there has been limited on-farm research to assess the impact of these technologies at the farm level. On the other hand, smallholder farmers are endowed differently and this would positively or negatively affect the adoption of recommended technologies and hence coffee productivity. This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of socioeconomic factors and technology adoption on smallholder coffee productivity at the farm level. The study employed stratified random sampling where 376 farmers were randomly sampled from six cooperative societies which had been preselected using probability proportional to the size sampling technique. The effects of socioeconomic factors and technology adoption on coffee productivity were analyzed using the stochastic Cobb-Douglas production function. The study revealed that off-farm income, access to credit, type of land tenure, and land size had significant positive effects on coffee productivity. Therefore, coffee farmers should be encouraged to diversify their income sources and to embrace credit financing, as the government reviews land use policies to avail adequate agricultural land. The study further revealed that the adoption of recommended application rates of manure, fungicides, and pesticides had significant positive effects on coffee productivity. The adoption of these technologies should therefore be enhanced among small-scale farmers to improve coffee productivity at the farm level.

T1  - Parcelized Cut-and-Carry Agroforestry Systems for Confined Livestock
AN  - 2489025230
AB  - We characterize a parcelized land management system that does not meet traditional co-located agroforestry practices in the tropics. A cut-and-carry agroforestry system for confined livestock emphasizes land utilization as a source of fodder, cutting and carrying feed from parcels to paddocks near a farmer’s home. It reduces feed cost by utilizing parcels under private, shared, and/or public ownership. Within cut-and-carry systems, we distinguish between those where parcels are managed as monocrops and traditional co-located agroforestry practices. Primary data for our case study were collected by surveying heads of household in Central Java, Indonesia, and analyzed following a capitals-based rural livelihoods framework. A sample of 122 farmers who managed parcels under co-located agroforestry practices was compared against 50 farmers who implemented parcelized monocropping. Overall, the adoption of cut-and-carry systems supports financial resiliency by limiting cash expenditures, facilitating income diversification, and producing assets that meet planned market opportunities and unforeseen cash needs. Survey results show that farmers who engage in parcelized agroforestry have more farming experience, higher farming income, are located at higher elevations, and live farther from the nearest local market. On-farm income among agroforestry cut-and-carry farmers was on average 11.1% higher than those using a cut-and-carry system but only adopting monocrop practices. Land as a biophysical capital asset under full private-ownership and at higher altitudes, and longer farming experience as a human capital asset, increased the likelihood of adopting parcelized co-located agroforestry practices. Membership in cash-crop cooperatives as a form of social capital asset was associated with a higher likelihood of managing land as parcelized monocrops.

T1  - Beyond subsistence: the aggregate contribution of <i>campesinos</i> to the supply and conservation of native maize across Mexico
AN  - 2486862375
AB  - Mexico is the center of domestication and a center for diversity of maize. Area planted with maize is the country’s largest agricultural land use, mostly planted by smallholder family farmers known as campesinos. They generally plant native varieties, saving and sharing seed by and among themselves, enabling the evolutionary processes that sustain and generate crop genetic diversity to continue today. Campesinos have been viewed as largely subsistence farmers generating limited maize surpluses. Here, we show that subsistence production is insufficient for explaining the quantity of maize they produce and the extent of the area they plant across Mexico. Our hypothesis is that beyond supplying their own consumption needs, campesinos collectively produce maize to respond to the demand of non-maize producing local consumers. We quantify the extent of subsistence versus surplus production among campesinos, showing that they produce more maize than would be needed to feed themselves and generate substantial surpluses. We test statistically the association between the area campesinos plant with maize across the country with socioeconomic variables that link their production to the demand by other consumers, and examine the implications of the results for the supply and conservation of native maize in the country. Our results suggest that maize trading linking campesinos to other consumers may be important and widespread, contributing to create additional incentives beyond self-consumption to plant native varieties from saved seed. We conclude that there are important opportunities for maintaining maize evolution under domestication at large scale by strengthening local maize markets.

T1  - Experiences from the Implementation of Community-Based Goat Breeding Programs in Malawi and Uganda: A Potential Approach for Conservation and Improvement of Indigenous Small Ruminants in Smallholder Farms
AN  - 2486679211
AB  - Maintaining diversity of small ruminant genetic resources is instrumental for sustainable agricultural production. Community-based livestock breeding programs (CBBPs) have emerged as a potential approach to implement breeding programs in smallholder farms. This study assesses the viability of CBBPs as a potential approach for conservation and improvement of indigenous small ruminants, using case studies of goat CBBPs in Malawi and Uganda. Data were collected using focus group discussions, personal interviews, and direct observations. The program promotes and empowers smallholders to have access to small ruminant feed resources through protection of existing communal pasturelands, capacity building in pasture production, and conservation of crop residues and crop by-products. Implementation of the CBBP enhances the contributions through improved animal growth performance, kids’ survival, and twinning rates leading to increased offtake rates and better prices. The existence of permanently established supporting organizations and other stakeholders provides sustainable institutional support instrumental for the establishment and growth of CBBPs. However, establishment of functional community-based institutions (producer cooperatives) and investments in institutional/policy reforms to safeguard fair trading, access to common resources by small ruminant keepers, and adoption of the CBBP model into national livestock development programs are some of the key milestones that can guarantee sustainability.

T1  - Comparative analysis on environmental and economic performance of agricultural cooperatives and smallholder farmers: The case of grape production in Hebei, China
AN  - 2480723557
AB  - Few studies have focused on the comparison of the environmental impact between agricultural cooperatives and smallholder farmers [9], which means it is still unclear whether and to what extent agricultural cooperatives reduce the negative environmental impact of agricultural production.

[...]a demonstration study was conducted in Changli County, a typical agricultural region in Hebei Province.

The grape and wine industries are the characteristic and leading industries that make significant contributions to creation of employment, generation of rural income and rural economic development in Changli County.

[...]grape production in Changli County is strongly representative of modern agricultural production, which may provide a better understanding of the environmental and economic performance of agricultural cooperatives and smallholder farmers.

Given the wide use of the LCA method, some authors have argued that LCA needs further development to address economic issues [19–21].

[...]some other analytical techniques have been combined with LCA such as data envelope analysis [22], GIS and spatial analysis [23], artificial intelligence methods [24, 25], optimization methods [26, 27] and cost benefit analysis [28].

[...]the government of Hebei pays close attention to the sustainable and low carbon development of all industries, including agricultural production, and many policy instruments are designed to support environmentally friendly industries.

[...]the grape cooperatives in Changli County inform their members about these policies and encourage them to adopt more environmentally friendly behaviors.

T1  - Experiments in farmers' collectives in Eastern India and Nepal: Process, benefits, and challenges
AN  - 2480208516
AB  - Do farmers' collectives, which pool land, labour, capital, and skills to create medium‐sized production units, offer a more viable model of farming for resource‐constrained smallholders than individual family farms? A participatory action research project in Eastern India and Nepal provides notable answers. Groups of marginal and tenant farmers, catalysed by the project, evolved into four different collective models with varying levels of cooperation, gender composition, and land ownership/tenancy status. Based on 3 years of action research, this paper examines how the models evolved and their differential outcomes. All groups have gained from cultivating contiguous plots in their efficiency of labour and machine use for land preparation and irrigation, and from economies in input purchase. Several collectives of tenant farmers have also enhanced their bargaining power vis‐a‐vis an entrenched landlord class and thus been able to negotiate lower rents and refuse long‐standing feudal obligations. However, the models differ in their extent of economic gain and their ability to handle gender inequalities and conflicts over labour sharing. The paper explores the historical, regional, and cultural factors that could explain such differences across the models. It thus offers unique insights into the processes, benefits, and challenges of farmers' collectives and provides pointers for replication and further research.

T1  - New evidence regarding the effects of contract farming on agricultural labor use
AN  - 2479966490
AB  - Contractual agreements between smallholder farmers and agribusiness companies have gained in importance in many developing countries. While productivity and income effects of contracting in the small farm sector were analyzed in many previous studies, labor market and employment effects are not yet well understood. This is an important research gap, especially against the background of continued population growth and structural transformation. Here, we investigate the effects of two types of contractual agreements between large international processing companies and smallholder farmers on agricultural labor use, household labor allocation, and hired labor demand in Ghana's palm oil sector. We use cross‐sectional survey data and a willingness‐to‐pay approach to control for unobserved heterogeneity between farmers with and without contracts. We find that agricultural labor intensity is substantially reduced through the contracts, because contracting in Ghana is associated with the adoption of labor‐saving procedures and technologies. Simple marketing contracts lead to reallocation of the saved household labor to off‐farm employment, whereas resource‐providing contracts lead to a stronger reallocation of labor within the farming enterprise. Household labor is more affected by labor savings than hired labor.

T1  - Oral history and traditional ecological knowledge in social innovation and smallholder sovereignty: a case study of erva-mate in Southern Brazil
AN  - 2485043821
AB  - We outline preliminary results of an ongoing research project conducted in collaboration with traditional erva-mate (yerba mate) producers in Southern Paraná and Northern Santa Catarina, Brazil. The multidisciplinary project includes researchers in the natural and social sciences, forest engineers, historians, rural outreach workers, and farmers and is the result of a long-term engagement with smallholder erva-mate producers. Previous research on forest conservation and use in the region had highlighted the important role smallholder farmers play in maintaining forest cover, but knowledge about how farmers and their families perceive traditional erva-mate production systems and understand their environment were needed. Taking a participatory action research approach, our goal is to work with communities to cocreate and share knowledge, ensuring that the research is based on collectively defined goals. Herein, we focus on some of the major themes identified through oral history interviews, particularly in terms of tensions between smallholder farmers and legal frameworks, as well as insecurity in terms of the continuation of traditional, agroecological practices and their importance for the forest. The project aims to engage a range of stakeholders and actors and incorporate a variety of perspectives in understanding forest conservation through use in agroforestry and agroecological systems, particularly in terms of erva-mate production.

T1  - The Contractual Aesthetics of Sharecropping in Black Conceptualism
AN  - 2484226153
AB  - The impersonal legal language of contracts, termed the “aesthetic of administration” by Benjamin Buchloh, has had a strong impact on postwar conceptualist art. In the U.S., however, a two-tiered legal system explicitly existed from before the founding of the republic up through the end of Jim Crow, and, implicit in so-called “colorblind” legal discourse, continue to exist. Without claiming an exclusive status for Black conceptualist art, Black artists often employ a critical approach to the universalism assumed by the analytical ethos of conceptualism. Making use of text and performance, the works of artists Adrian Piper, Charles Gaines, William Pope.L, Glenn Ligon, and Cameron Rowland offer an archive of nuanced operationalised language. The hybrid practices of artists like Rick Lowe and Martine Syms spill over into curation, signalling an emphasis on administration as an avenue for accruing cultural capital. Black conceptual artists and Black curators can be framed within a history linked not to identity per se, but to a skepticism that expands and enriches the conceptualist tradition, while suggesting a need to transform systems by which cultural recognition is allocated.

T1  - Effects of marketing contracts and resource-providing contracts in the African small farm sector: Insights from oil palm production in Ghana
AN  - 2476175198
AB  - Smallholder farmers in developing countries often suffer from high risk and limited market access. Contract farming may improve the situation under certain conditions. Several studies analyzed effects of contracts on smallholder productivity and income with mixed results. Most existing studies focused on one particular contract scheme. Contract characteristics rarely differ within one scheme, so little is known about how different contract characteristics may influence the benefits for smallholders. Here, we address this research gap using data from oil palm farmers in Ghana who participate in different contract schemes. Some of the farmers have simple marketing contracts, while others have resource-providing contracts where the buyer also offers inputs and technical services on credit. A comparison group cultivates oil palm without any contract. Regression models that control for selection bias show that resource-providing contracts increase farmers' input use and yield. Resource-providing contracts also incentivize higher levels of specialization and an increase in the scale of production. These effects are especially pronounced for small and medium-sized farms. In contrast, the marketing contracts have no significant effects on input use, productivity, and scale of production. The results suggest that resource-providing contracts alleviate market access constraints, while simple marketing contracts do not in this context.

T1  - Emerging Medium-Scale Tenant Farming, Gig Economies, and the COVID-19 Disruption: The Case of Commercial Vegetable Clusters in Ethiopia
AN  - 2473305084
AB  - Driven by the fast spread of private irrigation pumps, there has been a rapid expansion of intensive vegetable cultivation in the central Rift Valley in Ethiopia, making it the most important commercial vegetable production cluster in the country. Supporting that “quiet revolution” has been an inflow of migrant laborers—paid through daily, monthly, or piecemeal contracts, with few employment benefits attached to them—and a gig economy as widely used contractors organize, among others, mechanized land preparation, the digging of wells and ponds, seedling propagation, and loading of trucks. Almost 60% of the irrigated area is cultivated by medium-scale tenant farmers relying on short-term rental contracts. It seems that gig economies characterized by flexible contract arrangements implemented by outside contractors, which are increasingly fueling sophisticated sectors in developed countries, are important in these commercial agrarian settings in Africa as well. We further find that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant disruptions of this model, as seen by more limited access to services and the unavailability or high price increases in factor markets, especially for labor, and large but heterogenous price changes in output markets.

AN  - 2470865861
AB  - This article examines the nature of contractual relations between sugar outgrowers (contract farmers) and Tongaat Hulett Zimbabwe (THZ). Drawing from a research study conducted at Hippo Valley Estate, using a mixed-methods approach, findings reveal asymmetrical power relations in favour of THZ as reflected by its domination in price determination, monopsony control and risk sharing. Despite radicalisation and attempts by the state to curb the powers of international finance, the article argues that monopoly capital continues to wield significant control in Zimbabwe, leading to growing farmer indebtedness. Thus, the state–capital alliance presents a stumbling block for accumulation by sugar outgrowers.Alternate abstract:Cet article examine la nature des relations contractuelles entre les producteurs de sucre (« outgrowers », ou agriculteurs contractuels) et le Tongaat Hulett Zimbabwe (THZ). S’inspirant d’une recherche menée à Hippo Valley Estate, selon une méthode mixte, les résultats révèlent des relations de pouvoir asymétriques en faveur de THZ, comme en témoigne sa domination dans la détermination des prix, le contrôle de la monopsone et le partage des risques. Malgré la radicalisation et les tentatives de l’État de réduire les pouvoirs de la finance internationale, l’article soutient que le capital monopolistique continue à exercer un contrôle important au Zimbabwe, ce qui entraîne un endettement croissant des agriculteurs. Ainsi, l’alliance entre l’État et le capital constitue une pierre d’achoppement pour l’accumulation par les petits producteurs de sucre.

AB  - Through a qualitative case study from the Northern Region of Ghana, this paper examines smallholders’ perceptions of environmental change and contemporary Green Revolution prescriptions promoted by foreign donors, NGOs and the state. These prescriptions seek to commercialise and intensify production in Ghana through increasing use of chemical fertilisers, pesticides and faster-growing seed varieties. We argue that many smallholders are reluctantly adopting the inputs and techniques of the Green Revolution in response to erratic rainfall, shortened growing seasons, and drier soils with diminished fertility, as well as other structural constraints such as increasing competition for land. Farmers’ responses are also influenced by social inequalities, as gender and wealth differences affect access to agro-inputs and participation in farm contracts. Female farmers are especially disadvantaged in adoption, which is serving to widen disparities. However, even those farmers who are following the Green Revolution prescriptions are not uncritical of its impacts, as they commonly described their decision to adhere to this technical package as a short-term trade-off to meet subsistence needs at the expense of worsening soil health and increasing debt.

T1  - Microfinance services for smallholder farmers: an assessment from rice farmers’ expectations in Central Benin
AN  - 2433626203
AB  - This study analyzed the adequacy between credit supply and the expectations of rice farmers in Central Benin to define policies for improved agricultural-oriented financial services. A survey was conducted in October 2016 among 120 rice farmers randomly selected from six rice-farming villages. Data collected through structured and semi-structured interviews included the financial services offered by Microfinance Institutions, socio-demographic characteristics of rice farmers, their expectations and perception. Multivariate analysis combining hierarchical ascending cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to define the distinct groups of rice farmers according to their credit expectations. The unmet expectations of rice farmers for a credit scheme that suits their needs were identified based on the gaps between their expectations and perception. There were three rice farmers’ clusters with distinct characteristics based on their expectations. These farmers were not satisfied with all the attributes of the current credit scheme. Pending the effectiveness of the agricultural bank, the approaches such as the inventory credit system are useful in facilitating credit access to smallholder farmers. It is also essential to combine credit supply with financial education and technical support in a system such as contract farming.

T1  - Determinants of credit constraints and its impact on the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies among rice farmers in South-West Nigeria
AN  - 2388252001
AB  - Interventions on climate change adaptation strategies, involve capital outlays, mostly constrained in supply in developing nations. This study analysed the impact of credit constraints on climate change adaptation strategies among smallholder rice farmers in South-West Nigeria. The nexus between systems of credit constraints and choice of climate change adaptation strategies was estimated using Generalized Method of Moments with Instrumental Variable (IV-GMM) and the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the multidimensionality of the adaptation strategies and the loading with the highest eigenvalue was chosen and renamed as an improved technology. The results of the study show that risk credit-constrained smallholder rice farmers are less likely to adopt climate change adaptation strategies. The quantitative analysis from this study also points to the fact that age of the household, source of credit, and distance to the source of credit, interest rate, access to extension and climate information were the determinants of credit constraint amongst the smallholder rice farmers in South-West Nigeria. Considering the nexus between climatic factors and credit constraints as noted in this study, increasing awareness about how the credit market works and information on the provision of climate change can help farmers to better adapt to climate change. Therefore, it is recommended that the government frame an agriculture credit policy addressing the issues of smallholder farmers, particularly in areas that are vulnerable to climate change. The income from non-farm activities can be reinvested into farm operations to improve farmers’ adaptive capacity and subsequently increase productivity. It could also be recommended that policies enhancing and strengthening institutional support may also be valuable in augmenting the adaptation strategies of smallholder farmers. A necessary addition should be developed to the assistance already being provided under Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) in the form of loan guarantees and other risk-sharing incentives, such as a regulatory environment that supports the modern contractual obligations that are characteristic of well-functioning agricultural financing.

T1  - Exploring synergies and trade-offs among the sustainable development goals: collective action and adaptive capacity in marginal mountainous areas of India
AN  - 2471586949
AB  - Global environmental change (GEC) threatens to undermine the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Smallholders in marginal mountainous areas (MMA) are particularly vulnerable due to precarious livelihoods in challenging environments. Acting collectively can enable and constrain the ability of smallholders to adapt to GEC. The objectives of this paper are: (i) identify collective actions in four MMA of the central Indian Himalaya Region, each with differing institutional contexts; (ii) assess the adaptive capacity of each village by measuring livelihood capital assets, diversity, and sustainable land management practices. Engaging with adaptive capacity and collective action literatures, we identify three broad approaches to adaptive capacity relating to the SDGs: natural hazard mitigation (SDG 13), social vulnerability (SDG 1, 2 and 5), and social–ecological resilience (SDG 15). We then develop a conceptual framework to understand the institutional context and identify SDG synergies and trade-offs. Adopting a mixed method approach, we analyse the relationships between collective action and the adaptive capacity of each village, the sites where apparent trade-offs and synergies among SDGs occur. Results illustrate each village has unique socio-environmental characteristics, implying distinct development challenges, vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities exist. Subsequently, specific SDG synergies and trade-offs occur even within MMA, and it is therefore crucial that institutions facilitate locally appropriate collective actions in order to achieve the SDGs. We suggest that co-production in the identification, prioritisation and potential solutions to the distinct challenges facing MMA can increase understandings of the specific dynamics and feedbacks necessary to achieve the SDGs in the context of GEC.

T1  - Collective management of an environmental threat when exposure is heterogeneous – A complementary methods approach
AN  - 2467351429
AB  - We adopt a complementary methods approach to investigate whether and how heterogeneity in individual returns to a public good affects public good provision. We engage smallholder farmers in Sri Lanka in: a one-shot, framed, lab-in-the-field experiment, within which the farmers' rates of return to the public good are exogenously varied; and a survey including a question about the farmers' willingness to contribute time to the construction of a specific hypothetical public good, the return from which, for a given farmer, would depend on his or her circumstances in everyday life. In the former, we find weak evidence that heterogeneity in individual returns increases contributions. In the latter we find that those facing a higher return would contribute more, but no evidence that heterogeneity has an effect, either way, at the group-level. We conclude that heterogeneity in returns does not explain why collective action remains a challenge in farming communities in developing countries. From a methodological point of view, we find that using complementary methods provides a more balanced account of communities' potential engagement in public good provision.

T1  - Determinants of smallholder farmers’ decisions on fertilizer use for cereal crops in the Ethiopian highlands
AN  - 2466711137
AB  - This study identified decision variables influencing fertilizer adoption and optimal fertilizer rates among smallholder farmers in the Ethiopian highlands. The fertilizer adoption and fertilizer use were examined in four regional states using a questionnaire survey, which was administered to 2880 farm households. A double hurdle model was used to analyze factors influencing the two independent decisions of adoption of fertilizers and use of fertilizers. The model estimates of the first hurdle revealed that the probability of fertilizer adoption increased by 1.2% as household education status improved, by 1.4% for an increased number of active family members, by 5.6% with improved access to credit, by 3.4% with cooperative membership, by 3.3% with an increase in farm size, by 4.6% when soil and water conservation practices are employed, and by 3.4% when agroecology of the farm is located in the medium to highland zone. Conversely, the probability of fertilizer adoption reduced by 0.9% for an increase in family size, 0.6% with 1 km distance from all-weather road, 1.6% for a kilometer further to farm plots, and 0.9% for an increase in number of parcels. The intensity of use of fertilizers was influenced by education status of the household head, family size, access to credit, membership to cooperatives, use of crop rotation, annual income, number of farm plots owned, use of soil and water conservation, and agroecology. Therefore, a concerted effort is needed to encourage fertilizer adoption and optimum fertilizer use intensity by improving households’ resource endowment, institutional capacity to deliver services, and infrastructure development.

T1  - Supermarket procurement and farmgate prices in India
AN  - 2456877645
AB  - Supermarkets have gained in importance in the food systems of many developing countries, with profound implications for smallholder farmers. Several studies analyzed effects of selling to supermarkets on smallholder productivity and income. However, no previous work systematically analyzed effects of supermarkets on farmgate prices, even though prices are important determinants of farmers' profits and livelihoods. Here, we use data from smallholder vegetable growers in India to compare output prices received in supermarket and traditional market channels. We also quantify farmers' transport and transaction costs in both channels. Even after controlling for quality differences, prices are significantly higher in supermarket channels. Positive price effects are confirmed through hedonic price models and propensity score matching. Average effects of supermarkets on farmgate prices are in a magnitude of 20% or more. Higher farmgate prices are due to fewer intermediaries and lower transaction costs in supermarket channels. In the absence of binding contracts, supermarkets also need to pay higher prices to ensure regular supply of high-quality vegetables. These results suggest that the rise of supermarkets can contribute to increased market efficiency with positive effects on farmgate prices and revenues.

T1  - Agroecology as a pathway to resilience justice: peasant movements and collective action in the Niayes coastal region of Senegal
AN  - 2441520870
AB  - In semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa, farming populations face harsh climatic conditions but also very unequal and dynamic social processes that affect their resilience. This study addresses aspects of power and social justice related to the social-ecological system of the Niayes coastal region of Senegal and examines the potential of agroecology to improve the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers. We performed a knowledge co-production process with a local farmer union to identify the main social-ecological nexuses that matter for smallholder farmers, their dynamics and the influence of powerful actors and institutions on them. We also look at the potential actions of the farmer union under the banner of agroecology to transform these dynamics. We found that social-ecological dynamics involve reinforcing feedback loops that undermine the resilience of smallholder farmers and that powerful actors such as agribusinesses have a strong influence on these processes. Union actions promoting agroecology have enhanced system thinking and related solutions, but observed social justice claims are very recent and have a limited scope. Our findings expand the notion of resilience grabbing, understood as the undermining of resilience through the loss of commons, to include systemic degradations due to direct and indirect actions of involved stakeholders. We also propose to expand the notion of resilience justice vertically, integrating procedural and recognition justice, and horizontally, integrating linked social-ecological issues. We conclude that agroecology can become a transformative bridge from resilience grabbing to resilience justice, but must be more sensitive to power relations, in particular around labour.

T1  - Marketing strategy choice and the associated income differentials among smallholder dairy farmers in Ethiopia
AN  - 2564174410
AB  - This study investigates factors that influence the choice of marketing strategies among dairy farmers in Ethiopia. The farmers used three marketing strategies, namely, milk products marketing (26 per cent), raw milk marketing (59 per cent), and both milk products marketing and raw milk marketing (15 per cent). The results showed that the following factors influenced the probability of choosing a raw milk marketing strategy over milk products marketing: age of the household head, proportion of crossbreed cows owned, total milk produced, distance to the market, income per litre of milk, and cooperative membership. Further analysis revealed that dairy farmers are better off if they utilize the raw milk marketing strategy, which has higher returns. Farmers who relied only on milk products marketing had significantly lower dairy income. It is recommended that tailored efforts are channelled towards improving access to raw milk markets by establishing more milk collection points.

T1  - Community Initiatives and Local Networks among K’ho Cil Smallholder Coffee Farmers in the Central Highlands of Vietnam: A Case Study
AN  - 2436125176
AB  - Over the last two decades, coffee growers in Vietnam have faced the same problems as farmers all over the world. Ethnographic research among the community of K’ho Cil coffee growers in Lam Dong Province from 2016 to 2018 documented local initiatives to deal with the problems through the establishment of a K’ho Coffee network, revitalization of traditional production patterns, local integration into the global coffee commodity chain and agritourism entrepreneurship. Conceptualizing the way local K’ho Coffee growers generated and implemented the initiatives, this paper argues that by utilizing their social network, local farmers revitalized their economic production. Negotiating a decent collective position in the world system of the coffee commodity chain offers them a chance to survive the influx of economic deregulation and avert the impacts of climate change.

T1  - Making agro-export entrepreneurs out of <i>Campesinos</i>: the role of water policy reform, agricultural development initiatives, and the specter of climate change in reshaping agricultural systems in Piura, Peru
AN  - 2430251256
AB  - To increase agricultural exports across the Global South, countries are seeking to transform agrarian landscapes and the nature of campesino or smallholder agriculture. These agricultural reforms, however, do not exist in isolation. They work in conjunction with water policy reform to reshape agricultural systems and the people who manage these landscapes. While there has been significant research on agrarian change under neoliberal reform, few scholars have conducted empirical studies that examine how agricultural policy leverages water policy reform to generate changes across agricultural landscapes. Drawing on the case study of the Piura River basin in Northern Peru, this paper first explores how the IWRM inspired 2009 Water Resources Law furthers the state's agricultural development priorities by shifting water toward agro-export production. Secondly, this study demonstrates how climate change is being discursively mobilized as an emerging driver of water scarcity to legitimize these water reallocations. Thirdly, this case highlights how these water reallocations work in concert with the reinstatement of targeted agricultural support programs that seek to transform smallholder farmers into “agro-export entrepreneurs” but with meaningful exclusions. This study contributes to the limited scholarship on the 2009 Water Resources Law in Peru and also raises broader questions regarding how IWRM water management, climate change adaptation discourse, and agricultural development policy collectively promote the globalization of smallholder agriculture.

T1  - Gender, politics and sugarcane commercialisation in Tanzania
AN  - 2433207186
AB  - This article explores relationships between state, corporate capital and local stakeholders in the political economy of sugarcane from a gender perspective. The findings, based on empirical research at the site of Tanzania’s largest sugarcane producer pre- and post-privatisation, provide insights into the degree to which the estate-outgrower model can be regarded as ‘inclusive’ for women and men. Three aspects of commercial sugarcane production are analysed: land tenure, labour and leadership within canegrowers’ associations. We argue that politico-economic changes in the sector post-privatisation have increased gender differentiation in sugarcane production and consolidated power in the hands of local elites.

T1  - Laborers becoming ‘peasants’: agroecological politics in a Sumatran plantation zone
AN  - 2433206578
AB  - Over the last two decades a group of rural workers on Sumatra's Aren Volcano worked with a self-proclaimed ‘peasant’ union to occupy and rehabilitate a bankrupt industrial ranch and plantation. Women and men worked together to cultivate diverse, economically-valuable agricultural forests on this erstwhile industrial site. In reclaiming a zone of ruined industrial production for small-scale natural agriculture, Aren's laborers transformed themselves into agriculturalists and the land into a smallholder agroforest landscape. I consider how the transformations that unfolded in Aren are agroecological because rural workers harnessed ecological processes to create their smallholder plots, and political because they addressed issues of collective land control, identity, and work. I find the linkage of these two concepts, ecologically-attune smallholder livelihood and social mobilization, to be the source of the durability of this rural workers’ land reclamation.

T1  - Misidentification by farmers of the crop varieties they grow: Lessons from DNA fingerprinting of wheat in Ethiopia
AN  - 2421073276
AB  - Accurate identification of crop varieties grown by farmers is crucial, among others, for crop management, food security and varietal development and dissemination purposes. One may expect varietal identification to be more challenging in the context of developing countries where literacy and education are limited and informal seed systems and seed recycling are common. This paper evaluates the extent to which smallholder farmers misidentify their wheat varieties in Ethiopia and explores the associated factors and their implications. The study uses data from a nationally representative wheat growing sample household survey and DNA fingerprinting of seed samples from 3,884 wheat plots in major wheat growing zones of Ethiopia. 28–34% of the farmers correctly identified their wheat varieties. Correct identification was positively associated with farmer education and seed purchases from trusted sources (cooperatives or known farmers) and negatively associated with seed recycling. Farmers’ varietal identification thereby is problematic and leads to erroneous results in adoption and impact assessments. DNA fingerprinting can enhance varietal identification but remains mute in the identification of contextual and explanatory factors. Thus, combining household survey and DNA fingerprinting approaches is needed for reliable varietal adoption and impact assessments, and generate useful knowledge to inform policy recommendations related to varietal replacement and seed systems development.

T1  - IMPACT OF OUTGROWER SCHEME ON YIELD, OUTPUT PRICE, AND INCOME: A RICE-FARM-LEVEL STUDY IN THE MEKONG DELTA, VIETNAM
AN  - 2673630523
AB  - In this study, we attempt to examine the effects of participation in a rice out grower scheme on several outcomes, such as rice income and output price, in Vietnam's Mekong Delta by using the propensity score matching approach and employing cross-sectional data gathered from 248 rice growers. The results reveal that participation in the outgrower scheme has a significantly positive impact on farmers' rice income and output selling price. A possible implication of the results of this study is that the outgrower scheme may help increase rice households' income in the Mekong Delta.

T1  - Farmers' Cooperatives' Poverty-Reducing Roles in Agricultural Supply Chain Finance
AN  - 2400553826
AB  - Agricultural supply chain finance (SCF) plays a vital role in reducing poverty and linking smallholders with broader markets. By creating a multi-dimensional poverty index (MPI) for farmer households with A-F binary boundary method, this paper employs the propensity score matching and difference-in-difference (PSM-DID) method to estimate how farmers ' cooperatives run by various entities affect farmer households ' multidimensional poverty status. Our findings suggest that: (i) Each percentage of increase in the probability of farmers ' access to SCF credit from their cooperatives makes it 8% and 10% more likely for farmers' MPI and multi-dimensional poverty order to decrease with a significant poverty-reducing effect. (2) SCF credit from farmers ' cooperatives run by large farmers, agribusinesses and the village cadres are significantly poverty-reducing for fulltime poor farmers. (iii) The higher non-farm incomes as a share of farmers ' total income, the less poverty-reducing SCF credit from farmers' cooperatives run by large farmers and villagers becomes, and the more poverty-reducing SCF credit for agribusiness everyone cooperatives becomes. These findings highlight the importance of policy guidance for farmers' cooperatives to offer appropriate credit products and solutions according to local conditions, which is vital to maximizing the effects of targeted financial poverty reduction.

T1  - Economic Value of Dwarf Elephant Grass and Dried Distiller Grain with Soluble as Feed of Smallholder Dairy Farm in Tulungrejo Village, Ngantang District, Malang Regency
AN  - 2555622044
AB  - The average number of lactation dairy cattle ownership in community farms in Tulungrejo Village, Ngantang District, Malang Regency ranges from 5-6 cows per household. Farmers rely on grass as the main feed for dairy cows and concentrate from local Dairy Cooperative as additional feed. Average milk production was 10-11 liters/cow/day. Changes in the use of feed types have occurred in the last two years. The use of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) by farmers has slowly changed to dwarf elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum cv Mott) until now. The amount of concentrate given was reduced and replaced by DDGS by ratio (concentrate: DDGS) 1: 4. This study analyzed the economic value of the use of dwarf elephant grass and DDGS as feed especially its impact on farmers’ income. Data obtained through interview methods from 37 respondents of dairy farmers in Tulungrejo Village, Ngantang District, Malang Regency in July - September 2019. Data analysis was carried out in a descriptive quantitative manner. The results showed the average daily milk production increased by 18% or equivalent to 1.77 liters/cow/day and there was a 18.68% increase in farmer income or equivalent to IDR 7,397,160 within 2 years.

T1  - The Weight Gain and Growth of Crossbred Bulls Fed Locally Inspired Supplements Compared with Current Feeding Systems in Village Smallholdings in Malang, East Java
AN  - 2555621719
AB  - Growth rates of cattle in village smallholder farms are often low (0,2-0,5 kg/d) due to the ration formulation not meeting the nutrient requirements for cattle to achieve their potential live weight gain. This experiment aims to determine the growth of crossbred bulls fed a range of supplemented diets using local products comparing them to current traditional feeding system. This village was conducted in Kucur village, Dau sub-district, Malang. Fifyt cross bred aged between 1.5-2 years were allocated into five treatments; cassava-based diet by recent ACIAR-UB experiment (T1), commercial concentrate (T2), YaYa diet (T3), Santos diet (T4) and current feeding system (CFS) by smallholder farmers (T0) as the control. Cassava-based diet (T1) consisted of 50% cassava, 25% copra meal (CM) and 25% palm kernel cake (PKC). Local concentrate (T2) was bought from local cooperative in Malang. Yaya diet (T2) consisted of 30% cassava, 20% corn cob, 20% copra meal, 20% palm kernel cake and 10% rice bran. Santos diet (T4) consisted of 40 % corn cob, 20% palm kernel cake 20% rice bran, and 20% wheat pollard. Control treatment (T0) was 1 kg wheat pollard a day which was the general current feeding system by local smallholders. The experiment found that cassava-based diet (T1) supplementation showed the highest body growth compared to the other diets.

T1  - Production under input endogeneity and farm-specific risk aversion: evidence from contract farming and Bayesian method
AN  - 2502794987
AB  - Contract farming (CF) has been offered as a solution to missing markets in developing economies. However, little is known as to how the presence of CF affects production risk, technical efficiency and risk attitudes of the smallholder. This study investigates production risk, technical efficiency, output price uncertainty and risk attitudes of contract and independent farmers. Using a Bayesian estimation method and farm-level data from Nepal, we find that contract farmers are more risk-averse than the independent farmers. Contract farmers can increase output by reducing the scale more than independent farmers. We find that labour and capital are risk-reducing, while land and other inputs are risk increasing for both contract and independent farmers. Finally, independent growers consistently over-predict output prices.

T1  - Analysing the determinants, constraints and opportunities of smallholder farmers access to input markets: evidence from northern Ghana
AN  - 2423109968
AB  - Smallholder farmers face multiple constraints in accessing input markets. This study seeks to understand the dynamics that influence input markets in northern Ghana and the opportunities that exist for smallholder farmers to increase their productivity and welfare. Using a random sample of 448 households, the study applied the probit and non-parametric methods in identifying the factors that influence farmers' access to input markets and the key constraints faced by them. The results show that access to extension services, access to finance, distance to the nearest input market, and input source are significant factors that would be likely to influence farmers' access to input markets. Lack of finance, poor road network, and low prices of output are the main critically ranked constraints limiting farmers' access to input markets. Policy initiatives should be geared toward strengthening extension service delivery, farmer education on inputs, improving feeder roads, and encouraging private sector participation in input markets. Available opportunities to leverage on and improve farmers' access to input markets include the governments' input subsidy programmes, existing large-scale agricultural projects, private agricultural companies with contract farming models, and extensive network of input dealers and aggregators in the communities. These findings are relevant for farmers, input dealers and policy makers working to improve farmers' access to input markets.

T1  - Risk aversion, cooperative membership, and path dependences of smallholder farmers in Ethiopia
AN  - 2342973380
AB  - Smallholder farmers in Sub‐Saharan Africa often mitigate production risks through cooperative membership: institutionalized arrangements where they pool resources and collectively manage production and marketing chains. Cooperative membership has a significant advantage: it cushions detrimental effects of external forces, placing a premium on a risk‐seeking attitude (experimenting and innovating), which can yield greater accumulation. However, cooperatives are self‐selective institutions: relatively better‐endowed farmers, who are usually less risk‐avoidant than poorer ones (a consequence of their broader material bases), tend to be overrepresented. These two realities complicate the causal assessment of the relationships between risk attitudes, farmers’ socioeconomic status, and cooperative membership that is essential to comprehend the role of cooperatives in local capital accumulation. To help resolve this thorny analytical problem, an experimental study was carried out in eastern Ethiopia—a risky production environment where cooperatives feature prominently and relatively affluent farmers exist alongside poorer ones. It unveils the working of specific path dependences: poorer cooperative members are less risk seeking than nonmembers, but at an interval much less than that observed for affluent farmers. For development policies, this suggests that a greater payoff can be expected from investing in farmers’ material bases than from further improving cooperative membership.

T1  - Variation in Output Shares and Endogenous Matching in Land Rental Contracts: Evidence from Ethiopia
AN  - 2334112497
AB  - We investigate the extent of variation in output sharing in land rental contracts and alternative hypotheses to explain this variation. Close to half of the rental contracts in our study in northern Ethiopia have output shares that deviate from the dominant 50–50 equal sharing. Variation in land quality, the relative bargaining power of landlords and tenants, production risks and shocks are hypothesised to influence output shares. Matched data of landlords and tenants are used. The importance of endogenous matching of landlords and tenants is investigated by assessing how endogenous tenant characteristics are correlated with landlord characteristics. We find evidence of negative assortative matching for key resource characteristics. A control function approach is used to control for endogenous matching in the output share models. The results reveal that production risks, as well as relative bargaining power, affect output shares in the reverse tenancy setting where tenants are relatively wealthier and more influential than landlords.

T1  - Social Self-Organization and Social-Ecological Resilience in Food Systems: Lessons from Smallholder Agriculture in Kenya and Indigenous Guaraní Communities in Bolivia
AN  - 2713142686
AB  - Food systems face pressures related to global environmental change and agricultural intensification that make access to productive resources difficult for many actors. Social self-organization is one of the measures taken by actors to enable them to increase their capacity to mitigate challenges and increase their influence as well as build resilience against risks. The objectives of this study were to assess the level of social self-organization in food systems, to identify forms of social self-organization and the motivations behind them, and to analyze the benefits to food systems social-ecological resilience. We collected data from various actor groups at different levels of food systems using mixed methods. Analysis involved six indicators that were scored on a Likert scale. The study observed that smallholders in Kenya organized in women’s self-help groups, agro-ecological movements, and cooperatives, while in Bolivia the Guaraní indigenous people organized in movements addressing territorial integrity. Social self-organization was found to be important in resilience building at a community level and has potential to contribute to more sustainable food systems. However, more research on the link between social self-organization and policy change across scales would provide additional interesting insights.

AN  - 2631908918
AB  - The objective of this study is to analyse efficiency in resource use by cooperative producers with specialization in vegetable production and estimate the costs and return to such enterprises under cooperative conditions. Marginal physical product (MPP), marginal value product (MVP), and marginal factor costs (MFC) in addition to budgetary analysis were utilised to analyse the primary data collected through the questionnaire. The enterprise efficiency level is 0.06, the benefit-cost ratio is 1.06 while the expense structure ratio 0.37. The MVP results showed that all the resources used in production are under-utilized suggesting inefficiency of resource use by the cooperative producers. The result can be of advantage to producers if an appropriate understanding of cooperative principles is put into perspective in production-related decisions. Improvement of the level of utilization of input resources should be of interest to the government and related stakeholders.Alternate abstract:Šio tyrimo tikslas - išanalizuoti kooperatiniu gamintoju ištekliu, naudojamu auginant daržoves, efektyvumą ir ivertinti tokiu gamintoju kaštus ir grąžą kooperatyvo sąlygomis.

Nustatytas imonės efektyvumo lygis siekė 0,06, naudos ir išlaidu santykis - 1,06, o išlaidu struktūros santykis - 0,37. Pagal ribinio produkto vertės (MVP) rezultatus nustatyta, kad visi gamybos ištekliai yra nepakankamai naudojami, ir tai atskleidė, kad kooperatiniai gamintojai išteklius naudoja neefektyviai. Tyrimo rezultatai naudingi gamintojams priimant gamybos sprendimus, tačiau tik tuo atveju, jei tinkamai suprantami kooperatyvo principai. Taip pat rezultatai aktualūs vyriausybei ir suinteresuotoms šalims siekiant gerinti ištekliu panaudojimo lygi.

T1  - The system dynamics modeling of Gayo arabica coffee industry supply chain management
AN  - 2555101971
AB  - This study aims to design a model of supply chain management of Gayo Arabica coffee industry in an effort to increase value added and profit for smallholder plantation and company. The method applied to achieve this goal is a system dynamics methodology which is a modeling approach based on systemic thinking and uses perspectives based on information feedback and delay to understand the complex behavior dynamics of physical, biological and social systems, which occur in the supply chain management. The results showed that through the development of a hybrid production system and quality engineering in supply chain management of the Gayo Arabica coffee industry has been able to respond to the dynamics of consumer order. Scenario I and II made changes to model parameters which resulted in an increase in business profit obtained by company, while smallholder plantations did not experience changes in the profits of their business. Scenario III carried out a structural change model that was divided into two parts, namely the Scenario IIIA which applied institutional innovation between governance of public plantation relations with agro-industrial cooperatives in the form of coffee bean delivery system, while Scenario IIIB applied the governance of public plantation relations with agroindustry cooperatives in the form of transaction systems coffee bean. The results of Scenario IIIA are able to increase the value added and benefit obtained by smallholder plantation and be able to increase company profits and maintain customer satisfaction simultaneously. Scenario IIIB results are only able to increase company profits and maintain customer satisfaction, while increasing profits and value added of smallholder plantations do not occur.

T1  - Effect of Breed Types and Castration on Carcass Characteristics of Boer and Large Frame Indigenous Veld Goats of Southern Africa
AN  - 2545944906
AB  - Simple SummaryThe purpose of this paper is to describe and compare the carcass characteristics of same-aged young wethers and bucks of Boer Goat (BG) and Indigenous Veld Goats (IVG: Cape Speckled and the Cape Lob Ear)—a collective name for the eco-types conserved by the Indigenous Veld Goat Society of South Africa. Results of this study showed that, under the same production conditions, IVG could have a similar potential for meat production. Carcass characteristics differed more between wethers and bucks than between breed types. Large frame Indigenous Veld Goat (IVG) bucks seemed particularly suited for meat production, due to higher meat yield that is leaner with lower subcutaneous and intramuscular fat, compared to the BG bucks and, in particular, to the wethers of both breed types. The wethers meat with increased subcutaneous and intramuscular fat could satisfy another consumer market segment that prefer a somewhat juicier and flavorsome meat—these aspects warrant further research. Development of the formal commercial market for goat meat would offer more diversity of species for red meat producers and especially benefit smallholder farmers who typically produce most of the goats in the world.AbstractWeaner male Boer Goats (BG; n = 36; 21 bucks and 15 wethers) and large frame Indigenous Veld Goats (IVG; n = 41; 21 bucks and 20 wethers) were raised on hay and natural grass ad libitum and the recommended amount of commercial pelleted diet to a live weight between 30 and 35 kg. Carcass quality characteristics (live weight, carcass weights, dressing %, chilling loss and eye muscle area) were measured. The right sides of the carcasses were divided into wholesale cuts and dissected into subcutaneous fat, meat and bone. Large frame Indigenous Veld Goat (IVG) wethers were slightly lighter than the IVG bucks with no significant difference observed between BG. Wethers compared to bucks had higher dressing %, subcutaneous fat % in all primal cuts, intramuscular fat %, kidney fat % and, overall, slightly less bone %. Some breed–wether interactions were noticed: IVG wethers were slightly lighter than the IVG bucks, but the IVG bucks tended to produce higher % meat compared to other test groups. Judged on the intramuscular fat % characteristics, it seems as if wethers should produce juicier and more flavorsome meat compared to bucks.

T1  - New configurations in Brazilian agribusiness: rural warehouse condominiums
TT  - New configurations in Brazilian agribusiness
AN  - 2533889563
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to analyze the development of rural warehouses condominiums (or “condos”) as new rural configurations in the Brazilian agribusiness from the perspective of the theory of collective action.Design/methodology/approachA systematic literature review was complemented with multiple case studies based on interviews and direct observation. Content analysis was used to interpret the secondary and primary data.FindingsRural warehouse condos can be characterized as a collective action which is a new business model in Brazilian agribusiness. This new initiative has several advantages: reduction of the warehouse deficit and other logistical bottlenecks; strategic commercialization of production; reduction of logistical costs; inclusion of smallholders in the economy and, consequently, the generation of income for smallholders and their participation in the market.Research limitations/implicationsThe study used a qualitative approach and findings and discussion are inherently interpretative.Social implicationsUnderstanding the organization of rural warehouse condos supports the inclusion of smallholding farmers and income generation. This creates a social benefit through rural growth and economic development. Some constraints related to the lack of public policies, specific credit lines in financial institutions, the problem of non-regularized rural areas, lack of transparency and conflicts among the members can limit expansion.Originality/valueRural warehouse condos are expanding mainly in the south region of Brazil, where smallholders are concentrated. In this new configuration, they can engage in an association to obtain several benefits, such as reduced logistics costs, better access to financing and increased bargaining power with suppliers. As this research dealt with a relatively new and poorly studied topic, it contributes to the development of new studies to map innovative warehousing practices.

T1  - ADOPTION DECISION AND WELFARE IMPACT OF ECO-FRIENDLY AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES: EVIDENCE FROM SMALLHOLDER FARMERS IN SOUTH-WEST NIGERIA
AN  - 2516962761
AB  - The inevitable desire for productive and remunerative agriculture with zero negative impact both on the environment and the natural resource base (natural systems) in the quest to mitigate the impact of climate extremes on the agri-food ecosystem, farming households ' welfare, and food security status in Nigeria, necessitates farmers' adoption of eco-friendly agricultural practices (conservation agricultural practices) which are adjudged to be climate-smart. These practices are confluence in nature, interrelated and mutually enabling, with specific trade-offs. Households' survey data from the randomly selected 350 smallholder farmers were analyzed with heterogeneous treatment effect econometrics model to investigate farmers' adoption status of ecofriendly agricultural practices, and to find out if farmers' adoption decision have impact on their welfare gains. Bearing in mind that, many of the previous related studies on adoption of improved agricultural practices in South-west Nigeria seemed not to have accounted for the possible selection and hidden bias usually associated with non-experimental research of this nature. The findings indicated that adoption is still largely partial. Similarly, the results revealed that adoption had a welfare-increasing impact for every change in the rank of the propensity score. However, years of formal education, trust index of social capital, active involvement in collective action, and frequent extension delivery system were found to significantly predict adoption of these practices. These important dynamics also differentiated the adopters and non-adopters of these practices by welfare-gains. Importantly, rosenbaum sensitivity test used for robustness checks revealed that the negative effect of adoption on farmers' welfare-gains was insensitive to selection bias. Hence, the ATT estimate from HTE model was a pure impact effect of the adoption. The study concluded that a large proportion of the farmers with a high propensity to adopt these practices were perhaps the ones with high comparative advantage as regards access to productive resources, which included: farmland holdings, labour, capital, social networks, and institutional supports. This also permits to infer that there is a possibility for the farmers to perform better to experience positive effects, if efficient enough to stay within the production possibility frontier.

T1  - Effects of nucleus-farmer outgrower schemes on profitability among smallholder farmers: Empirical evidence from Northern Ghana
AN  - 2480198757
AB  - Nucleus farmer-outgrower schemes are contractual arrangements where a large farmer (nucleus farmer) who is well-resourced takes charge of smaller farmers by providing them with the necessary training on agronomic practices and some farm inputs for production. The study assesses the effects of nucleus farmer-outgrower schemes on profitability among smallholder farmers in Northern Ghana. A total of 330 smallholder farmers made up of 150 outgrowers and 180 non-outgrowers were interviewed using structured questionnaires. A comparative analysis is made between outgrowers and non-outgrowers. The study employs the binary logit regression model to identify the factors influencing participation in nucleus farmer-outgrower schemes and the propensity score matching technique to estimate the effect of nucleus farmer-outgrower schemes on profitability of smallholder farmers. The study reveals that the factors that significantly influence smallholder farmers’ participation in nucleus farmer-outgrower schemes are gender, marital status, farm size, membership of an FBO and extension contact. Gender and marital status of a farmer have negative influence on participation whilst farm size, membership of an FBO and extension contact have positive influence on participation. It was also revealed that nucleus farmer-outgrower schemes have significant positive effect on smallholder farmer’s gross margins, net margins and returns on investment. The study recommends that, nucleus farmers and other stakeholders who are involved in developing outgrower schemes or similar initiatives should take into consideration the social and demographic characteristics of the target farmers to enhance participation.

T1  - Determinants of agricultural technology adoption in Ethiopia: A meta-analysis
AN  - 2480198744
AB  - One way of fostering smallholder farmers’ agricultural productivity is through encouraging agricultural technology adoptions. However, agricultural technology adoption remains very low in Ethiopia. As a consequence, many studies have been researched why agricultural technology adoption remained low. Nonetheless, a handful information is available on aggregate factors influencing agricultural technology adoption in Ethiopia. Therefore, very little is known about the common factors affecting agricultural technology adoption in Ethiopia. Hence, this meta-analysis was aimed to quantify the determinants of agricultural technology adoption from adoption literature. Based on a comprehensive and systematic search strategy, and inclusion and exclusion criterion, 12 studies conducted between 2010 and 2018 were included in this meta-analysis. Random effect model was used to identify the determinants of agricultural technology adoption in Ethiopia. Results of random effect model confirmed that age of the household head, education level, farm size, livestock holding, access to extension services, access to credit services, cooperative membership and distance from the market were significantly associated with agricultural technology adoption. Therefore, policy makers and other stakeholders should focus on common variables found to affect agricultural technology adoption in designing policies that encourage agricultural technology adoption in Ethiopia.

T1  - Impact of contract farming on income of smallholder malt barley farmers in Arsi and West Arsi zones of Oromia region, Ethiopia
AN  - 2480198291
AB  - This study examined factors that influence farmers’ participation in malt barley contract farming and West Arsi zones of Oromia region, Ethiopia. Data were collected from 384 (190 contract and 194 non-contract) randomly selected farm households. The probit model showed that age, livestock ownership, credit access, distance to the main market and cooperative membership had positive and significant effects on decision regarding contract farming participation. Propensity score matching technique was used to estimate the impact of participation in contract farming on farm households’ income. And it revealed that contract farming resulted in an increased annual gross farm income of Birr 24,302.20 for contract, which is 27.80% higher than the gross annual income of non-contract malt barley farm households. The finding of this study highlights that contract farming is viable to increase farm household’s income, which policy makers and other concerned agencies may consider as an alternative rural development approach so long as it is tailored to contexts alike.

T1  - Does Collective Action Improve Gender Inclusiveness in Agrarian Change? Evidence from Cassava Based Smallholder Households in Nigeria
AN  - 2454694421
AB  - Does collective action heme an enhancing effect on gender inclusiveness in the agrarian change matrix? This was investigated among 800 cassava-based smallholder households in a cross-sectional survey in Nigeria. Agrarian change was viewed as a function of access to productive resources (land, other assets), processes (Value addition and Nonfarm employment) and outcomes (income) in the study areas. Findings revealed that collective action was able to improve access to resources (land and assets) needed to drive the processes of agrarian change among male and female farmers. The study recommends strengthening institutions for collective action to drive positive and inclusive agrarian changes.

T1  - Towards Cleaner Production: Certified Seed Adoption and Its Effect on Technical Efficiency
AN  - 2443897160
AB  - The implementation of new agricultural technologies has become a driving force for cleaner production on smallholder farms. Particularly, identifying technologies could enhance the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production, both of which are serious challenges. In this context, evaluating the adoption of certified seed and its impact on efficiency gains and waste reduction is highly fundamental for sustainable smallholder food production. This perspective was not always considered in previous studies. We address this research gap using cross-sectional data from wheat farmers in northern Kazakhstan. A multi-stage sampling procedure is employed while the sample-selection stochastic production frontier (SPF) is applied for a robust estimation. Results reveal that increased crop income, access to credit and education positively influence the adoption of certified seed while membership in cooperatives and distance from the market are negative determinants. We also find that adopters are 10.3% “cleaner in production” than non-adopters. A comparison was made between the conventional SPF and the sample-selection SPF to evaluate the credibility of the estimation. It was found that the estimates from the conventional SPF were biased by 10%. This study provides insights into two policy and scholarly questions, namely, how effective the adoption of certified seeds is in promoting cleaner production among wheat farmers and how it can be promoted among wheat farmers. Therefore, our study presents substantial empirical evidence to encourage investment in or to promote certified seed adoption in wheat production.

T1  - From Peasant to Farmer: Transformation of Forest Management in China
AN  - 2426811984
AB  - In the past 40 years, China has experienced an unprecedented transformation of the rural society and livelihoods and self-subsistence forest management has transitioned to more business-oriented management, typically the Forestry Cooperatives, Family Forestry Farms and Forestry Specialized Households identified in this study. We explored the factors contributing to this transformation using household survey data in seven provinces in 2016. The age and education of the household heads, income, the holding areas of cropland, ecological forest, forestland, leasing forestland, and legally contracted forestland and their located provinces were found to be statistically significant in transforming the household’s forest management. The factors that drive transformation to various ownership types show some variations as well. The findings can help us better understand not only the transformation of forest management, but also the rural economy and society in general. The results have policy implication on how to further facilitate forest management transformation.

T1  - Understanding the Interdependence and Temporal Dynamics of Smallholders’ Adoption of Soil Conservation Practices: Evidence from Nigeria
AN  - 2385998337
AB  - The adoption of soil conservation practices is widely recognized as essential in improving soil fertility and promoting climate-smart agriculture in general. Yet, smallholders’ adoption of soil conservation practices in Sub-Saharan Africa has not been adequately documented, especially in relation to the interdependence and temporal dynamics of adoption decisions. In this paper, we analyze the interdependence and temporal dynamics of smallholders’ adoption of soil conservation practices, such as animal manure, crop residue retention, intercropping, and crop rotation in northern Nigeria. We use data from two rounds of a farm-household panel survey among maize-based farming households and estimate econometric models, including pooled multivariate probit and random effects ordered probit. We found that there is a significant positive correlation between the soil conservation practices, suggesting that adoption decisions for these practices are interrelated and the practices are considered complements by the farmers. We found evidence of inter-temporal variability in the adoption of soil conservation practices, which suggests that some farmers do switch in and out of these practices and may likely explain the often-reported variability in maize yields. Also, we found that the farmers’ decisions to adopt soil conservation practices and the intensity of adoption are influenced by several factors, including farmer-, household-, farm-, institutional-, and biophysical-level factors. Yet, the factors that significantly influence the likelihood of adoption differ slightly from those that influence the intensity of adoption. Policy interventions to enhance the adoption intensity of conservation practices should strongly leverage important factors, such as contract farming, crop–livestock integration, and off-farm income diversification.

AB  - A few small tea growers in Assam, India, shifted to organic production of tea considering the ecological and economic benefits of organic cultivation. However, lack of sufficient training, technical know-how, inadequate experience, and market access posed serious threats to sustaining their business. Amidst the difficulties, some of these growers managed to overcome the initial problems of the production of organic tea. The present study uses a mixed method, multi-site, collective case study approach to understand the situation of these growers and to analyze it within the framework of farm entrepreneurship. The organic growers displayed entrepreneurial characteristics of being innovative, risk-taking, and opportunity seeking to overcome the initial difficulties. The findings suggest that the development of entrepreneurial skills among small growers would be crucial to promoting organic cultivation in the small tea growers sector.

T1  - Business 'Power of Presence': Foreign Capital, Industry Practices, and Politics of Sustainable Development in Zambian Agriculture
AN  - 2314481449
AB  - Sustainable Development Goals have brought optimism around 'agriculture for development' but also questioned agribusinesses in sustainable development. This paper assesses how an agribusiness' power exploits domains to exert control over industry governance. Using interviews and group discussions from three smallholder outgrower schemes under Illovo Sugar Plc in Zambia, the paper demonstrates that corporations can deploy the 'power of presence' to influence national policy development, and sustainability in regional and local practices. Investment and trade policies currently foster agribusinesses but overlook environmental assessments that expose social and ecological contradictions such as on competing water uses. State-donor relations enable smallholder integration in sugarcane as poverty reduction whilst agribusinesses are limiting their participation through controls on resources and production systems. By analysing power expressions, we show how possibilities of sustainable agriculture and rural development are undermined by agribusiness practices. We suggest that current policy efforts around 'agriculture for development' in Zambia are about entrenching power and interests of an agribusiness, neglecting industry expansion and sustainability. The paper highlights the limits and importance of domestic institutions in framing large-scale agricultural investments as well as mediating corporate practices that will be required to provide a greater focus on national planning processes for sustainable agriculture and rural development.

T1  - Why Does Sharecropping Survive? Agrarian Institutions and Contract Choice in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan
AN  - 2314125852
AB  - A century ago, Alfred Marshall demonstrated the inefficiency associated with farmers receiving only a portion of their marginal product. Farmers will supply less labor than under arrangements in which they receive their marginal product; output will be sub-optimal. Explanations of sharecropping are based on market imperfections, e.g., high transactions costs or inability to insure against risk, suggesting that sharecropping should disappear with economic development. Nevertheless, sharecropping survives. In Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, sharecropping has no legal status but farm surveys provide evidence of its existence. Despite farmers’ awareness of the Marshallian paradox, institutional uncertainty contributes to the persistent attractiveness of sharecropping.

T1  - UNDERSTANDING MEMBER CHARACTERISTICS AND COOPERATIVE PRICE EFFECTS: THE CASE OF THE ARGENTINEAN DAIRY SECTOR: ANNALES DE L'ECONOMIE COLLECTIVE
AN  - 2312683213
AB  - Since the 1990s, Argentinean dairy‐processing cooperatives have lost considerable amounts of members and market share. We analyse their current role by investigating the characteristics of farmers who continue delivering to them and price differentials between cooperatives and investor‐oriented firms (IOFs). A probit regression model applied to 917 farmers suggests that cooperative farmers are more disadvantaged than farmers delivering to IOFs in terms of education, farm size and productive technology. Moreover, t‐tests applied to data representing 70 per cent of national volume indicate that farmers delivering to cooperatives are between 11 per cent and 29 per cent smaller than those delivering to IOFs, depending on province. A hierarchical multilevel regression model applied to 9,720 transactions among farmers and processors shows that, after controlling for quantity and quality, cooperatives pay lower (3.5%) but more stable prices than IOFs. In a context of rapid structural change, we observe a market in which larger farmers deliver to IOFs and smaller farmers deliver to cooperatives and conclude that, at the expense of paying lower prices, cooperatives may act as buyers of last resort for otherwise disadvantaged farmers.

T1  - Mechanisms of Inclusion: Evidence from Zambia’s Farmer Organisations
AN  - 2312395593
AB  - Policymakers and donors increasingly rely on farmer organisations (FOs) when implementing rural development strategies, though research suggests that targeted groups such as poorer households tend to participate less in FOs than richer ones. Here, we discuss mechanisms that may contribute towards the inclusion of disadvantaged households, using primary data from Zambian FOs involved in implementing an agricultural subsidy programme, and applying qualitative comparative analysis to identify individual and combined effects of four explanatory factors on inclusion. Our results suggest long-term commitment as a necessary condition. We further identify three alternative pathways that explain inclusion while within-case analysis describes their underlying causal mechanism: inclusion develops in FOs that show commitment and either provide financial services to vulnerable members, promote social identities or compensate disadvantaged members for not being able to access subsidised inputs. These results can explain why some FOs are more effective than others in reaching disadvantaged target groups.

T1  - Sales and Marketing of Fresh Milk by Smallholder Dairy Farmers in West Java
AN  - 2558106891
AB  - As a highly perishable product, sales and marketing are very important for fresh milk produced by dairy farmers. This paper aimed to analyze the sales and marketing of fresh milk done by smallholder dairy farmers in West Java. Data used in this paper is a part of the IndoDairy Smallholder Household Survey (ISHS) data collected during August–September 2017, covering 600 smallholder dairy farm households in Bandung, Garut, Cianjur, and Bogor Regencies. Descriptive statistic analysis using tabulation was employed to process the data. Almost all the dairy farmers sold fresh milk, except one in Bogor who sold milk in the form of processed milk. Almost all farmers (98 percent) sold their fresh milk to dairy cooperatives, showing dairy farmers’ strong dependency on the dairy cooperatives. The price of fresh milk received by the farmers ranged from Rp4,794/L (Bogor Regency) to Rp4,212/L(Cianjur Regency), giving an average of Rp4,459/L. Due to the strong dependency on the dairy cooperatives, it is important to strengthen dairy cooperatives’ management capacities to help dairy farmers improve their milk quality, and hence prices, as well as dairy farmers’ welfare.

T1  - Perceived Environment-Economic Benefits and Factors Influencing the Adoption of Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil Production System by Smallholder Farmers
AN  - 2558013284
AB  - Palm oil industry plays a vital role in Indonesia economy. The palm oil industry can also support sustainable development since it is based on renewable natural resources. The contribution to sustainable development is hampered if oil palm production system, especially of smallholder farmers is not sustainable. Smallholder farmers consist of almost half of the total of oil palm plantations in Indonesia. The sustainability of oil palm farming of smallholder farmers may influence significantly to the overall sustainability. The adoption of Indonesia sustainable palm oil production system by smallholder farmers may improve the sustainability of oil palm farming. This study aimed to find out if perceived environment-economic benefit differed between conventional and sustainable oil palm farmers and to uncover factors affecting the adoption of Indonesia sustainable oil palm production system. The respondents were selected using a purposive sampling method, comprising of 313 conventional smallholder farmers and 167 smallholder farmers implementing Indonesian sustainable palm oil production system. A structured-questionnaire used to gather data. Descriptive statistics and logic regressions were utilized to analyse the data. The results show that the perceived environment and economic benefit is higher for farmers adopting sustainable palm oil production than conventional farmers. Several factors which were the age of farmer, formal and non-formal education, income, total land managed, the involvement of farmer in a cooperative, and environmental management did not motivate farmers to adopt Indonesian sustainable palm oil production system. While the experience of the farmers, family size, main job, involvement in farmer‘s association, doing good cultivation practice, and plantation management influenced the adoption of Indonesian sustainable palm oil production.

T1  - Smallholder farmers' willingness to pay for scale-appropriate farm mechanization: Evidence from the mid-hills of Nepal
AN  - 2337150980
AB  - This paper analyzes smallholder farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) for the purchase of scale-appropriate farm mechanization in the hill ecologies of Nepal using the case of mini-tiller technology: a small, 5–7 horsepower two-wheel tractor primarily used for agricultural land preparation. Using primary survey data from 628 randomly-selected households, we find that farm size, local wage rates, out-migration, access to credit services, and associations with agricultural cooperatives positively influence the WTP for mini-tillers while the number of draft animals owned negatively influence the WTP for mini-tillers. On average, farmers were willing to pay 31% less than the actual price of a mini-tiller. Results also exhibited a heterogeneous demand in which the lowest quartile farm size households, typically the poorest farm households, were willing to pay 26% less for the mini-tiller than the top quartile of farms. In the context of labor scarcity and rising rural wages, agricultural policy on farm mechanization in Nepal should aim to prioritize small farms through robust service provision models in order to increase the level of farm mechanization in the country.

T1  - Determinants of market outlet choices by smallholder teff farmers in Dera district, South Gondar Zone, Amhara National Regional State, Ethiopia: a multivariate probit approach
AN  - 2312736184
AB  - In Ethiopia, teff is an important cereal crop, particularly in Dera district. It is a source of food and provides cash income for majority of smallholder farmers. To commercialize teff producers, selecting an appropriate market channel is mandatory. However, selecting an appropriate market channel is not an easy task because there are different factors that influence market outlet choices. Therefore, this study aimed to identify factors that influence teff market outlet choices. A two-stage random sampling procedure was used and a total of 154 smallholder farmers were randomly and proportionally selected to collect primary data. Multivariate probit model was employed to identify factors affecting teff market outlet choices. The result of the study shows that the probability of teff producers to choose wholesaler, retailer, consumer and cooperative market outlets was 31.82%, 35.71%, 37.01% and 16.88%, respectively. This shows that consumer was the most likely chosen market outlet while cooperative was the less likely chosen market outlet. The joint probability of farmers to choose the four market outlets is (0.1%) lower than the likely of no choosing four market outlets (19.5%). The result of multivariate probit model revealed that age of household head, land size, quantity of teff produced, lagged price of teff, family size (AE), membership of cooperatives and distance to the nearest market were found to be statistically and significantly affecting the market outlet choice behavior of teff producers. This implies that improving the production capacity of farmers and invests on rural cooperatives would help smallholder farmers to choose the rewarding market outlet. Therefore, the study suggested that improving the existing production system, farmers relying on intensive cultivation; giving better price for farmers and being membership of cooperative are important strategies to select the appropriate market channel.

T1  - Farmers' knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards timber out-grower schemes in selected districts of Malawi
AN  - 2311811851
AB  - Timber out-grower schemes have proved to be one of the most profitable enterprises for rural households. No wonder, several analysts and researchers regard them as an alternative model to avoid problems of displacement and create 'win-win' outcomes for both rural communities and private investors in forestry. However, understanding farmers' knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards tree out-grower schemes plays a key role in farmers' adoption of the interventions. This study examined these farmers' attributes towards out-grower schemes in selected districts of Malawi. Data were collected from 300 farmers who were randomly selected between September and October 2017 through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. The results revealed that 82% of the respondents participated in timber out-grower schemes, piloted by WVI and ICRAF. Based on a median score of 4.75 (IQR 4-5), respondents were strongly agreed on their knowledge on timber out-grower schemes as a basis for adopting the intervention. Using the cumulative Cube-root frequency method of stratification, the results revealed that more than half (51%) of the respondents belonged to the high category, and thus had high knowledge of timber out-grower schemes, whereas 32% and 17% had very high and medium levels of knowledge, respectively. The study also revealed that 79.3% of the respondents had a positive attitude towards out-grower schemes. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive, significant relationship between marital status (r = 0.081), household size (r = 0.062), education (r = 0.051) and knowledge of the respondents on timber out-grower schemes. A significant positive relationship was also observed between marital status (r = 0.156), household size (0.178), education (0.002), ethnic group (0.151) and attitudes of the respondents towards timber out-grower schemes. However, a negative relationship between knowledge and attitude was revealed (r = -0.534). The study therefore concludes that socio-economic factors, such as gender, education, ethnic group and household size, should be considered in upscaling timber out-grower schemes in Malawi.

T1  - Smallholder farmers' market participation and mobile phone‐based market information services in Lilongwe, Malawi
AN  - 2310234875
AB  - There has been growing interest in the development of technology‐based systems to empower farmers in Africa. This paper determines the effect of mobile phone‐based market information services (MIS) on farmers' decisions to participate in maize markets in Lilongwe, Malawi. The study reveals insufficient evidence to suggest that the MIS influence farmers' market participation decisions. Knowledge of prevailing prices may not necessarily guarantee farmers market participation, especially when buyers determine market prices and transaction costs are high. Consequently, farmers with no access to alternative markets fail to improve their marketing outcomes. The findings suggest that channelling government's resources towards improving extension services and increasing farmers' productivity are ideal ways to promote the participation of smallholder farmers in agricultural markets. The findings also underscore the need to integrate radio and mobile phones in agricultural MIS and to provide farmers with information related to agricultural production in addition to market prices. These recommendations could be realized through better coordination of market access initiatives involving smallholder farmers, government departments, NGOs, mobile network operators, and media houses.

T1  - Who gains from contract farming? Dependencies, power relations, and institutional change
AN  - 2292894720
AB  - The paper highlights the mechanisms through which outgrower contract farming creates dependencies at the local level. Using sugarcane case study in Malawi, we show that dependencies are created through redefinition of use rights to customary land and through the redefinition of cash flows into outgrower communities. Through this two-dimensional process, corporations can secure access to land, exert control over local communities and transform the local social relations of reciprocity serving as the pillars of resistance. Our results indicate that contract farming changes rural agrarian relations, transforms local family institutions by carefully selecting a few household members with influence into the scheme and selectively dispossessing the poor community members.

T1  - The impacts of oil palm plantations on local and migrant smallholders’ incomes
AN  - 2557951316
AB  - In Indonesia, oil palm plantations have long affected income levels positively. Furthermore, Indonesia has developed oil palm smallholdings in 1980 to improve rural incomes. The success of this program has attracted other farmers and migrants to further developed oil palm plantations. Those who collaborated with companies were known as scheme smallholdings, while the others are known as independent smallholdings. In general, the lack of professional assistance has caused independent smallholdings to perform lower than the scheme ones. In addition, on average, the migrants also performed better as they were familiar with the collective actions of group activity management. Using as many as 210 and 219 scheme and independent smallholders from the Provinces of North Sumatra, South Sumatra, Jambi and Riau, such assumption were tested using the ANOVA compare means test of the four groups, namely schemed local and migrant, and independent local and migrant. Comparisons between the smallholders’ incomes and the Regional Minimum Wages of each province were analysed. The results showed that oil palm plantations have significantly improved the smallholders’ incomes in all provinces, although the impacts were observed to be higher for the scheme-migrant smallholders, not only concerning income, but also for productivity and selling price. However, this was likely due to the difference between scheme and independent rather than locals and migrants. This was partly explained due to the collective actions of all migrant-schemed smallholders in both the input purchases and the output sales and around 50% of the local-schemed, while almost all independents did it individually.

T1  - Economic Valuation of Bee Pollination Services for Passion Fruit (Malpighiales: Passifloraceae) Cultivation on Smallholding Farms in São Paulo, Brazil, Using the Avoided Cost Method
AN  - 2338451090
AB  - This paper estimates the economic value of ecosystem services provided by Brazilian native bee, Xylocopa spp. Latreille (Hymenoptera: Apidae), pollination on a scale relevant to individual smallholder farmers that produce yellow passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims). The study areas are located in the vicinity of Pedro de Toledo and Itariri (Sao Paulo State—Brazil), in the Atlantic Forest region. The local economy is based on family farms, small stores, and ecotourism. The value was obtained using the ecological economics Avoided Cost Method, also known as replacement cost. Farms from this region informally hire temporary day laborers to supplement natural pollination with manual pollination of passion fruit flowers, so the cost of contracting temporary laborers was used to estimate the economic value of bee pollination. The value of pollination services was estimated at US$ 2,583.00 per hectare over 2 yr of P. edulis farming. Our estimates based on passion fruit farmer surveys and ecological valuation over 2 yr suggest that manual pollination accounts for 44–48% of production costs and results in a loss of ~58% of profits when wild bee pollination services are not available and manual pollination is required. We suggest that smallholder farmers follow the suggestions of previous studies and conserve adequate forest habitat for bee nesting and foraging, plan pesticide use around flowering and pollination, and supplement bee populations to maximize the benefit of the pollination ecosystem service and profits.

T1  - Rural Business Hub: Framework for a New Rural Development Approach in Rain-Fed Areas of Pakistan—A Case of Punjab Province
AN  - 2331603555
AB  - The purpose of this article is to present a framework that could be used to achieve the objective of sustainable rural development in a community which is characterized by high numbers of smallholders, landless peasants, and unskilled or semi-skilled labor ultimately leading to low productivity and high rates of poverty. The study presents a design inspired by “Saemaul Undong” (New Village Movement) of South Korea. The proposed model is based on proposing a four-tier approach for the working of the village-level cooperatives which will be self-reliant through a network connection to the national and international markets. Existing studies and surveys in Punjab province of Pakistan have established that rural areas are often lacking essential facilities that affect the abilities of these areas to retain skilled manpower thus leading to resource drain and negatively impacting the agricultural productivity. The proposed Village-City Model, “VCM,” was designed to strengthen the local infrastructure and built interest-based cooperatives to develop an environment which can sustain the benefits of higher productivity and translate these into better livelihoods. It is proposed that farmer-centered cooperatives with appropriate institutional arrangements could result in developing village-based cities where skilled manpower can exert to in better resource use efficiency, access to market coupled with rural finance schemes to enhance resource base and access to technology. The cooperatives experience is considered as a bitter experience in Pakistan. However, the analysis of failures of cooperatives in Pakistan revealed many bottlenecks which have been addressed through indigenization of Saemaul Undong.

T1  - Socio-cultural Factors influencing livestock investment decisions among Smallholder Farmers in Mbulu and Bariadi Districts, Tanzania
AN  - 2310601305
AB  - Several different actors are involved in making sure smallholder farmers are motivated to commit funds in expectation of future returns (investment decisions) from useful domesticated animals (livestock). However, efforts by the government, international organizations and the private sector have not been able to significantly increase trade trends in Tanzania’s livestock which explains that there could be a lot more reasons for that. This manuscript assesses the socio-cultural factors (SCFs) influencing livestock investment decisions among smallholder farmers in Mbulu and Bariadi districts in Tanzania. A cross-sectional research design was employed where a sample of 333 respondents and 9 key informants were interviewed. Primary data were collected using a structured questionnaire and a key informant checklist. A binary logistic regression model (BLRM) was used to analyse the relationship between SCFs and livestock investment decisions. Results show that store of wealth is the most influencing factor followed by prestige, bride prices, ethnicity and number of children (significant at p < 0.05) to household livestock investment decisions. The study generally concludes that smallholder farmers consider their cultural perspectives before they decide on livestock management styles and that blending the SCFs and other factors could secure more livestock investments.

T1  - Determinants of Smallholder Farmers' Marketing Channel Choice: Evidence from the Vietnamese Rice Sector
AN  - 2319112989
AB  - Cash crops such as specialty rice and other high‐value varieties produced for domestic and international markets are considered an increasing source of income for smallholder farmers in many Asian countries. The present study focuses on the factors affecting Vietnamese specialty rice farmers' choice of marketing channel and how their choice influences farm performance. The analysis has been conducted using multinomial logit and linear regression models on quantitative data collected from 280 specialty rice farmers in the Red River Delta, one of the main rice production regions in Vietnam. Results reveal that even though local collectors and wholesalers are still the most common recipients of farmers' goods in rural areas, reduction in transaction costs with regard to uncertainty influences farmers to choose modern marketing channels through collective action (via specialty rice farmer associations). This collective marketing channel helps farmers increase average prices received by US$0.028 per kg of paddy. Based on the results, manifold political implications are derived.

T1  - Big is efficient: Evidence from agricultural cooperatives in Ethiopia
AN  - 2287340880
AB  - In Ethiopia, there is a renewed interest in agricultural cooperatives as an institutional tool to improve the welfare of smallholder farmers. One of the pathways through which cooperatives benefit their members is scale economies. However, the establishment of cooperatives in Ethiopia seems to pay little attention to the size of the organizations. This article aims at investigating the effect of size on cost efficiency of agricultural cooperatives. More specifically, the purpose is to examine whether a single cooperative can serve a given number of farmers at a lower cost than two or more smaller cooperatives could. We employ the concept of cost subadditivity to compare the cost efficiency of large versus small cooperatives, and by extension unilateral actions. We estimate a flexible production technology using cross‐sectional cooperative‐level data. Findings show that costs would drop by 78% to 181% if farmers join hands in relatively large rather than small cooperatives.

T1  - Willingness to Pay for Insured Loans in Northern Ghana
AN  - 2269961796
AB  - Index insurance has been heralded as a potential solution to risk management problems faced by smallholder farmers in developing countries. Despite its potential, demand for standalone index insurance contracts has remained low in early field trials. We investigate the willingness to pay for drought index insurance‐backed loans in northern Ghana using contingent valuation. We find that index insurance lowers overall demand for agricultural loans. We also compare micro‐level index insurance, provided directly to farmers, with meso‐level insurance, provided to the credit agency and find that farmers appear to prefer micro‐level insurance. Finally, farmers are willing to pay to avoid basis risk.

T1  - Examining the farmer-buyer relationships in vegetable marketing channels in Eswatini
AN  - 2267998940
AB  - Vegetable farming is the main source of livelihood for smallholder farmers in Eswatini. However, the production and marketing challenges they faced inhibits the farmers from benefiting fully, which calls for relational transactions to enhance exchange efficiency. Therefore, this study aims to determine the nature of relationship constructs between vegetable farmers selling to formal and informal channels. Data elicited from 170 farmers were analysed using factor analysis, multiple regression analysis and discriminant analysis. Results revealed that farmers derived satisfaction from the price offered and communication, while trust was derived from satisfaction, communication and duration of the relationship, and commitment was derived from trust in both channels. The discriminant analysis results revealed that there is statistical significant difference between the channels. Farmers supplying formal markets perceived levels of satisfaction, trust, and commitment better than those supplying informal markets. The results also indicated that satisfaction and trust were the best predictors of the nature of the relationships. The lack of written contracts and low produce quantity purchased by the formal markets contributes to the low-level establishment of the farmer-buyer relationships. Therefore, coordinated supply chains and supplier-development approaches are necessary to complement the logistical requirements associated with fresh produce and to create mutual benefits.

T1  - The living university in relation to popular classes in Brazil. A critical analysis of higher education policies
AN  - 2282315908
AB  - This article discusses the relationship between university and popular classes as an alternative to the privatist tendencies of higher education policies, as well as science and technology, in Brazil, in this period of transition from the neo-developmental project to the deepening of counter-reforms, which started in the 1990s. The subject is developed from bibliographical and documental research (Brazilian legislations), besides testimonies from Brazilian researchers who have worked together with family farmers, smallholders, settlers, and recyclable material collectors that are organised in cooperatives and associations. Our analyses are structured in dialogue with the hypothesis of dysfunctionality of the university. A review of higher education and science and technology policies is carried out and considered in regard to inclusion and the relationship with the popular classes. Our focus is on the first decade of the twenty-first century, a brief period of neo-developmentalism that ended with the deepening of the current counter-reforms. Initially, it is analyzed the higher education. Then, it is discussed the trends in Science and Technology policy. This is followed by analyzes of the relationship between university and popular classes, an alternative that is carried out contradictorily. It is concluded that the University recreates itself by contributing to popular classes.

T1  - Smallholders’ Perceptions of Fire in the Brazilian Amazon: Exploring Implications for Governance Arrangements
AN  - 2276694172
AB  - Fires have been on the rise in the Brazilian Amazon for a decade, causing biodiversity loss, carbon emission, and damage to local people’s assets and health. Often blamed as being responsible for starting most of the fires, local farmers are also the main actors involved in fire prevention and firefighting. We explore small-scale farmers’ perceptions of fire and governance arrangements through Q methodology and semi-structured interviews. We find that fire prevention and firefighting are both perceived as collective issues. Lack of engagement in these activities is largely related to fire risk perceptions and its controllability, which depends on local collective action, landscape flammability, and the size of the area of fire contagion. To counter large fires, government action is essential. Policies that are supportive of fire control norms and enabling of firefighting seem more likely to achieve positive results than fire bans.

T1  - Credit and Land Contracting: A Test of the Theory of Sharecropping
AN  - 2511817007
AB  - Choice of a share vs. fixed rent land rental contract has figured prominently in the theory of industrial organization. This theory tells us that, while a share contract is inefficient in a first‐best world, it may be the preferred option under second‐best conditions. It has thus predicted the existence of sharecropping as the potentially preferred contract under conditions of liquidity constraint. Rigorous empirical evidence is, however, still lacking on this basic contribution of theory. We use a randomized experiment in a credit program for landless workers and marginal farmers organized by BRAC in Bangladesh to show that increased access to credit has a large positive effect on the choice of fixed rent over share rent contracts, both in terms of number of contracts and area contracted. As predicted by theory, the magnitude of this shift away from sharecropping is enhanced when the tenant is less exposed to risk. Development programs that facilitate access to credit to potential tenants can thus help them take more efficient land rental contracts.

T1  - Smallholder willingness to pay and preferences in the way irrigation water should be managed: a choice experiment application in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
AN  - 2279753474
AB  - Efficient and sustainable utilization of irrigation water is the key to realizing the objective of enhancing agricultural productivity and commercializing smallholder irrigation farming. Valuing and recognizing the scarcity of irrigation water is essential for its sustainable use. Using cross-sectional data from 328 smallholders in and around Makhathini and Ndumo-B irrigation schemes in KwaZulu-Natal Province, the study aimed to assess smallholder farmers' preferences for the way irrigation water resources should be managed and their willingness to pay for irrigation water. This was done employing a choice experiment method. The results suggest the need for irrigation water pricing to reflect irrigation intensity. They also show that improving agricultural production and productivity, with market access can enhance farmers' willingness and ability to pay for irrigation water. The need to consider multiple uses of irrigation water for sustainable utilization of water resources is evident, while supporting women smallholders will have a positive impact on their willingness to pay for irrigation water. The paper recommends a shift towards on-farm volumetric water pricing in the irrigation schemes. The schemes should also have clearly defined boundaries and enforceable rules on collective use of water. The design of irrigation infrastructure should integrate other uses of irrigation water such as domestic and livestock purposes. Consequently, there is a need for further research to ensure that irrigation water prices reflect the marginal value of irrigation water use. Policies should address factors that inherently result in gender differences in terms of access to productive resources which negatively affect sustainable water utilization.

T1  - The impact of credit on the technical efficiency of maize-producing households in Northern Ghana
TT  - TE of maize-producing households
AN  - 2237462343
AB  - PurposeProduction credit is essential for enhancing the technical efficiency (TE) and the welfare of smallholder farmers in Africa. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of credit on smallholders’ TE using cross-sectional data from 223 maize-producing households in Northern Ghana.Design/methodology/approachDue to the exogenous assignment of credit and assumption of homogeneity in farm technologies, the propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used to compare the average difference in TE between farmers that had received credit and those that had not.FindingsThe results revealed that production credit impacts positively on smallholder farmers’ TE. Access to production credit is significantly influenced by access to markets and extension services, distance to market, asset index and land fragmentation. The provision of credit enhances the timely purchase and efficient allocation of farming inputs to produce the maximum possible output. Per capita income and land fragmentation also play important roles in reducing smallholders’ TE.Practical implicationsTo increase efficiency gains, credit programs for agricultural interventions should target resource-poor smallholder farmers. The efficiency gains can be sustained through stronger partnerships with financial institutions. Policy interventions aimed at increasing smallholder farmers’ access to production credit (e.g. through the creation of a conducive investment environment that lowers the lending rate and collateral requirements) must be vigorously pursued.Originality/valueTo the best of authors’ knowledge, this is one of the only recent studies to examine the impact of credit on the TE of farming households by applying the translog stochastic frontier production function and the PSM approaches.

T1  - Estimating Technical Efficiency and Production Risk under Contract Farming: A Bayesian Estimation and Stochastic Dominance Methodology
AN  - 2225596172
AB  - We investigate production risk, technical efficiency and risk attitudes amongst contract and independent farmers. We use a Bayesian parametric approach and stochastic dominance quantile regression methods to compare technical efficiency and risk attitude of smallholders in Nepal. Using farm‐level data, we find that contract farmers appear to show lower inefficiency and lower production risk. Additionally, contract and independent farmers can increase output by reducing the scale of operation. Regardless of the commodity produced and farming arrangement (contract or independent production), we find that labour, land and other inputs are risk‐augmenting, while the role of capital is mixed. We find a second order stochastic dominance (SSD) for lentils, and first order stochastic dominance (FSD) for tomatoes, ginger and HYV paddy seed commodities. Finally, contract farmers are more risk averse than independent farmers, regardless of the commodity produced.

T1  - The impact of supermarket supply chain governance on smallholder farmer cooperatives: the case of Walmart in Nicaragua
AN  - 2166269556
AB  - Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and governments are promoting cooperatives as key to linking smallholder farmers with modern markets to achieve inclusive development, yet the specifics of these supply relationships remain poorly understood. This article uses data from 51 interviews with supply chain stakeholders and a survey of 110 smallholder vegetable farmers in Nicaragua to investigate the impact of cooperative-supermarket supply chain relationships on cooperatives, and the role retailers and NGOs play in facilitating these relationships. The study found that in Nicaragua, cooperatives selling to Walmart became unstable, in contrast with the performance of cooperatives selling to local supermarket chain La Colonia. The results show that cooperative performance is impacted by an interaction between differences in the types of farmers reached by the two supermarket chains, in the performance of the NGOs involved in each supply chain, and in the supermarkets’ business practices. The findings suggest that NGOs should pay more attention to buyer sourcing strategies and farmer needs when designing development interventions to link cooperatives of resource-poor farmers to markets, so as not to increase the vulnerability of smallholder farmers.

T1  - Assessment of risk factors and isolation of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> from bovine subclinical mastitic milk in and around Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia
AN  - 2158086427
AB  - A cross-sectional study with simple random sampling approach was conducted from November 2017 to May 2018 with the objectives of estimating the prevalence of subclinical mastitis with its associated risk factors and to identify and isolate Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli from mastitic milk in and around Gondar town, Ethiopia. The study was conducted on 334 lactating cows selected from 70 smallholder dairy farms. California mastitis test (CMT) and bacteriological culture methods were used as diagnostic tools. From 334 cows examined, 114 (34.1%) and from 1054 quarters examined, 238 (17.8%) were positive for subclinical mastitis using CMT test. Adult and old cows were 3.681 (95% CI = 1.541, 8.788) and 15.044 (95% CI = 3.051, 74.174) times more likely to have a chance of contracting mastitis than young cows respectively. Cow’s having 4–7 calving were 88.9% (OR = 0.111, 95% CI = 0.29, 0.423) less likely to have a chance of contracting mastitis than cows having ≤ 3 calving by keeping another factors constant. Mid-lactating cows were 63.4% (OR = 0.366, 95% CI = 0.150, 0.890) less likely to have a chance of contracting mastitis than cows in the early lactation stage. Crossbreed cows were also 79.1% (OR = 0.209, 95% CI = 0.046–0.948) less likely to have a chance of contracting mastitis than local breed cows. The odds of subclinical mastitis were 21.81 (95% CI = 4.618, 103.002) times higher in cows having tick infestation compared to cows without tick infestation and animals kept in good housing were 23% (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.027, 0.197) less likely to have mastitis than cows kept in poor housing. The likelihood of mastitis occurrence was 3.372 (95% CI = 0.865, 13.141) times higher in cows managed in intensive farming system than semi-intensive farming system. Out of fifty CMT positive milk samples, proportion of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was 17 (34%) and 8 (16%) respectively. As a conclusion, subclinical mastitis is the main important health constraints of dairy cows in the study area. Therefore, management, housing, and environmental sanitation should be improved.

T1  - Pastoralists’ perception of and adaptation strategies for climate change: associations with observed climate variability
AN  - 2227637110
AB  - Although climate change is a universal phenomenon, its indicators and manifestations are entirely local, as are adaptation choices, strategies, and practices. Based on face-to-face interview data from 427 randomly selected pastoral households of the Hulun Buir grassland in northern China, this study investigated perceptions and impacts of historical climate change and the associations of these perceptions with observed climate change. Meanwhile, we identified pastoralists’ responses to climate change, as well as barriers to the adaptation process. We used binary logistic regression models to determine the factors that influence climate change adaptation strategies. The results show that pastoralists’ perception of the inter-annual variability in climate variables is relatively consistent with the observed meteorological data. Pastoralists’ adaptive strategies for climate variability comprise primarily livestock and pasture management interventions, such as “purchasing fodder”, “reducing livestock”, “part-time grazing”, and “renting pasture”. In addition, pastoralists identified several barriers that are allied with adaptation practices, such as limited grassland tenure, an absence of credit, and limited access to agricultural markets. Furthermore, the sex, age, and education level of the head of household and the household livelihood capital and location were found to be the key factors determining the choice of adaptation strategies. This knowledge helps to assess the needs for action and information and to improve the credibility of policies that shape collective actions based on a unified plan or goal. Combined, these efforts aid in adaptation to reduce the vulnerability of the livestock sector, especially the livelihood security of smallholder pastoralists in grassland ecosystems.

T1  - Safe milk and risky quinoa: The lottery and precarity of farming in Peru
AN  - 2216249424
AB  - The neoliberal global food system has intensified the uncertainties associated with peasant farming and agrarian livelihoods around the world. This article examines processes of precarization among smallholder farmers in the Majes Irrigation Project in Peru. By discussing price volatility and uncertainty related to the "free market," I argue that the conditions of small-scale entrepreneurial farmers today can best be understood in terms of gambling and precarity. After four decades of neoliberal deregulation, farmers in Majes describe agriculture as a "lottery" where one can win or lose everything. Despite prospects of growth and progress, most farmers rely on low-income dairy farming or contracted crops for agro-industrial corporations. The freedom to take risks in the open market entails uncertainty and often results in loss, and farmers must negotiate the ambiguous relation between autonomy and dependency.

T1  - Stakeholder engagement through empowerment: The case of coffee farmers
AN  - 2190922910
AB  - While most studies on stakeholder engagement focus on high‐power stakeholders (typically, employees), limited attention has been devoted to the engagement of low‐power stakeholders. These have been defined as vulnerable stakeholders for their low capacity to influence corporations. Our research is framed around the engagement of low‐power stakeholders in the coffee industry who are, paradoxically, critical resource providers for the major roasters. Through the case study of Lavazza—the leading Italian roaster—we investigate empowerment actions addressed to smallholder farmers located in Brazil, India, East Africa, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. We contribute to the theoretical discussion around engagement and empowerment by developing a framework linking together areas of empowerment (defined in the literature) and specific empowerment actions (emerging from our interviews). Our insights shed light on how organizations can design empowerment strategies leading to more effective stakeholder engagement and how empowerment actions can contribute to turn low‐power stakeholders into active business partners. We demonstrate that moving from a traditional competitive view of corporate–stakeholder relationships to a stakeholder theory view based on a logic of cooperative partnerships reinforces the idea that stakeholder engagement and empowerment are both entangled with the value creation process.

T1  - Determinants of adoption of sustainable production practices among smallholder coffee producers in Nicaragua
AN  - 1977616183
AB  - Efforts to slow down and eventually reverse the trend of climate change will take time, and in some cases, the negative impacts of climate change will be felt long before long-term solutions to this problem can bear fruit. Adaptation and mitigation strategies constitute the front line of attack for rural households in developing countries that rely on agricultural production and natural resource use as their main source of income and growth, and whose livelihoods are threatened by climate change. This study models the determinants of adoption of sustainable production practices by coffee producers in the department of Matagalpa, in northern Nicaragua. Using primary survey data, we analyze the extent to which cooperative membership impacts adoption of ten different practices. We find that coffee farmers who belong to cooperatives have adopted sustainable practices at higher rates than non-members, and that the odds of adoption are higher for members than for non-members. A factor analysis was conducted to determine the underlying structural differences between the ten practices, and from this analysis three factors emerged and were modeled. We find that cooperative membership is a significant determinant of practices that promote water conservation, yet not significant for practices that promote soil and plant health, nor for practices related to field management. These findings are valuable for policy makers, donors, and development and extension practitioners in the coffee sector, as they can better inform and guide policies toward more efficient and effective paths of long-term climate change adaptation.

T1  - Replanting of smallholder palm oil plantations in Dharmasraya District, West Sumatera Province, Indonesia
AN  - 2557639650
AB  - This study aimed to formulate the steps of replanting preparation to empower the smallholders in palm oil plantation in Dharmasraya District. This study used a descriptive qualitative method with a case study. Primary data were collected by interview and discussion with famers who are the Koperasi Unit Desa (KUD, a rural cooperative institution) members and management, and key informants. Data were analyzed by strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats (SWOT) analysis. Empowerment of the smallholder's palm oil plantations can be carried out through: 1). Empowering of the smallholders' institutions by re-functioning the farmer groups and cooperatives with a new management formation; 2). KUD and farmer groups establish a replanting model (conventional, stage replanting, under planting or intercropping); 3). Preparing a standard operational technical procedure for the approved replanting model; 4). Preparing a budget and time planning for replanting implementation including the immature plantation period; and 5). Arranging the management of plantation after entering the production period. For those activities of the replanting program, the regional government supports are needed by facilitating, supervising and accompanying the implementation. Besides, the KUD requires training and assistance especially in cooperative management, financial management and guidance on implementing the principles of sustainability.

TT  - Les transformations de l'économie agraire au Zimbabwe, 15 ans après le Programme accéléré de réforme agraire
AN  - 2269357195
AB  - The reconfigured agrarian structure imposed new production and commoditisation patterns across the settlement types in Zimbabwe. From 2000, new markets were established, with differentiated effects on capital accumulation for different sets of farmers. After the Fast Track Land Reform programme, the impact of the economy-wide challenges, climate change, capital and global geo-politics on the agrarian economy remain relatively unexplored. Using a case study of Hwedza District, this article reveals the changing agrarian relations beyond the trimodal agrarian structure, showing that smallholder farmers have significantly relied on reinvestment of agricultural sales proceeds rather than contract farming. Farmers exit the contract farming arrangements citing their exploitative nature. The article contributes to the debate on Zimbabwe's agrarian and political transition.Alternate abstract:La reconfiguration de la structure agraire a imposé de nouveau schémas de production et de marchandisation à travers les différents types de champs au Zimbabwe. A partir de l’an 2000, de nouveaux marchés furent établis, avec des effets d’accumulation de capital différenciés selon les fermiers. Suite à la mise en œuvre du Programme accéléré de réforme agraire, l’impact des défis économiques, du changement climatique, et de la géopolitique internationale et nationale sur l’économie agraire demeurent relativement inconnus. Utilisant une étude de cas du district de Hwedza, cet article met en lumière les transformations des relations agraires, au-delà de la simple structure agraire trimodale, montrant que les petits exploitants agricoles se sont appuyés de façon conséquente sur le réinvestissement des bénéfices des ventes agricoles plutôt que sur une agriculture contractuelle. De nombreux fermiers ont cessé d’utiliser ces arrangements contractuels, citant leur nature exploitatrice. Cet article contribue au débat sur la transition agraire et politique du Zimbabwe.

T1  - Smallholder farmers’ social networks and resource-conserving agriculture in Ghana: a multicase comparison using exponential random graph models
AN  - 2246254981
AB  - We examined what type of information network structures lie within rural cooperatives and what these structures mean for promoting resource-conserving agriculture. To better understand whether and how environmental outcomes are linked to these microlevel social relations or network structures, we quantified individual farm- and community-level biomass accumulation and carbon stocks associated with the adoption of agroforestry, a set of farming techniques for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resilience. We also collected social network data on individual farmers across five communities. This empirical evidence was derived from primary fieldwork conducted in the Ghanaian semideciduous cocoa (Theobroma cacao)–growing region. This data set was examined using standard network analysis, combined with exponential random graph models (ERGMs). The key findings suggest that farmers with more biomass accumulation from the adoption of agroforestry practices also tend to be popular advisers to their peers at the local level. Presumably, farmers seek peers who demonstrate clear signs of achieving successful land management goals. Using ERGMs, we also show that commonly observed individual-level results might not scale to the collective level. We discuss how our individual-scale findings could be leveraged to foster farmer-to-farmer social learning and knowledge exchange associated with resource-conserving agricultural practices. However, we also highlight that effective whole networks, such as cooperative collectives in these communities, remain elusive.

T1  - HOW SHOULD RURAL FINANCIAL COOPERATIVES BE BEST ORGANIZED? EVIDENCE FROM ETHIOPIA: ANNALES DE L'ECONOMIE COLLECTIVE
AN  - 2174209092
AB  - What is the optimal size and composition of Rural Financial Cooperatives (RFCs)? With this broad question in mind, we characterize alternative formation of RFCs and their implications in improving rural households’ access to financial services, including savings, credit and insurance services. We find that some features of RFCs have varying implications for delivering various financial services (savings, credit and insurance). We find that the size of RFCs exhibits nonlinear relationship with the various financial services RFCs provide. We also show that compositional heterogeneity among members (including diversity in wealth) is associated with higher access to credit services, while this has little implication on households’ savings behavior. Similarly, social cohesion among members is strongly associated with higher access to financial services. These empirical descriptions suggest that the optimal size and composition of RFCs may vary across the domains of financial services they are designed to facilitate. These pieces of evidence provide some suggestive insights on how to ensure financial inclusion among smallholders, a pressing agenda and priority of policy makers in developing countries, including Ethiopia. The results also provide some insights into rural microfinance operations which are striving to satisfy members’ demand for financial services.

T1  - Brokers – A Weapon of the Weak: The Impact of Bureaucracy and Brokers on a Community-based Forest Management Project in the Brazilian Amazon
AN  - 2166900073
AB  - The bureaucracy that regulates land tenure, agriculture and community-based forest management (CBFM) in the Brazilian Amazon aims at achieving an impartial administration and process of practices that complies with the intention of laws, regulations and decrees and safeguards the rights of the citizens at large and particularly people in a vulnerable position. Yet the local power-holders’ actual interpretation and implementation of laws, regulations and decrees is to large extent opaque, arbitrary and contingent upon subjective intentions, interests and perspectives. These irregularities and arbitrariness affect poor smallholders hard and hamper their access to resources and formal rights. This paper intends to show how the smallholders who have initiated a CBFM project in a settlement in the north-eastern region of the Brazilian Amazon are unable to manage the project on their own, because they lack financial capital, as well as the necessary social and political capital to be able to obtain compulsory permits and make the contracted firm and people comply with the terms of the contracts. In order to transcend these difficulties, the smallholders utilize their social networks, above all vertical contacts, to attract brokers. The paper argues that this strategy assigns great power and influence to various brokers, and affects how policies are implemented, how resources are distributed or not distributed and how power relations are articulated. These aspects of governance and governmentality are grossly under-theorized in research on development projects in general and CBFM in particular. The paper is based on participant observation and various forms of interviews, carried out in 2012–2017.

T1  - Inclusive and Ecologically-Sound Food Crop Cultivation at Tropical Non-Tidal Wetlands in Indonesia
AN  - 2257786900
AB  - Productivity and cropping intensity on non-tidal wetland in South Sumatra are considerably low and has been underutilized up to now. The majority of farmers in this ecosystem are smallholders with limited adoption capacity on introduced technologies and modern agricultural practices. The objectives of this research were (1) to comprehensively capture multidimensional constrains that restrained local farmers in increasing their agricultural productivity; and (2) to identify, assess, and develop substantially-relevant, financially-affordable, and socially-acceptable agricultural technologies and practices for smallholder farmers to increase productivity. This research was organized in three main activities: qualitative research employing Grounded Theory procedure, quantitative questionnaire-guided survey, and a series of laboratory and field experiments. The research results indicated that the main constraints in increasing productivity and cropping intensity on the non-tidal wetland in South Sumatra include (1) unpredictable flooding occurrence and low soil nutrients content (agronomic constraint), (2) low financial and technology adoption capacity of local farmers (economic constraint), and (3) public policy has not significantly escalated farmer’s motivation to increase food production (social and institutional constraint). This research suggests that multidimensional (technical, financial, ecological, and socio-cultural) approaches should be integrated in collective efforts for sustainably intensifying food production on the non-tidal wetland.

T1  - Diffusion and adoption of Integrated Striga Management (ISM) technologies among smallholder maize farmers in rural northern Nigeria
AN  - 2207944442
AB  - This study estimated the actual and potential adoption rates of Integrated Striga Management (ISM) technologies, among smallholder maize farmers in rural northern Nigeria, using the treatment effect framework. The results revealed a significant overall adoption rate of 55% of the targeted population while 83.5% of the farmers were exposed to the ISM practices. With such an incomplete diffusion of the ISM technologies, the study estimated potential adoption rate to be 68.2%, while the actual adoption (JEA) rate was estimated to be 58.3% resulting in an adoption gap of 9.9% due to incomplete diffusion/exposure. In addition, diffusion and adoption of ISM technologies were found to be influenced by factors such as famer's years of farming experience, total farm size under maize cultivation, cooperative society's membership, attendance of farm workshop/seminars, on-farm trials and field days among others. Policy implications for increase productivity and food security through ISM technology diffusion and adoption were discussed.

T1  - Can commercial farming promote rural dynamism in sub-Saharan Africa? Evidence from Mozambique
AN  - 2186794652
AB  - The impact of commercial farms on smallholders in developing countries remains highly controversial. This study draws on four periods of investments in commercial farming in Mozambique to frame an empirical analysis of their contemporary economic spillovers. We investigate the degree of selection of commercial farms into more favourable locations as well as the extent of heterogeneity in the effects of different commercial farming models on proximate smallholders. The analysis uses survey data covering all large commercial farms in Mozambique and which are linked to a nationally-representative survey of 6000 smallholders. Contrary to widespread assumptions that investors target only marginal farm land, we find that commercial farms are highly selective in their locations, preferring areas close to existing infrastructure and markets. Controlling for selection bias via reweighting and fixed effects, we find the presence of a commercial farm is associated with moderately higher incomes among neighbouring smallholders but a lower incidence of wage employment. Furthermore, these effects vary according to the type of commercial farming in place. More inclusive commercial models, such as those associated with outgrower schemes, appear to generate larger benefits. We conclude that broad generalizations about commercial farming investments must be replaced by more nuanced discussions of alternative investment models.

T1  - The insurance premium in the interest rates of interlinked loans in a small-scale fishery
AN  - 2162968390
AB  - Interest payments based on income flows are a common feature of informal loans. Such so-called ’interlinked loans’ can be seen as insurance against very low disposable incomes, as interest payments are lowest when income turns out to be low. This paper examines whether interlinked loans indeed contain an insurance premium and how those premia are determined. A simple theoretical model predicts that interest rates of interlinked loans increase with income volatility when insurance premia exist. Based on data from a small-scale fishery in India, calculations show that, on average, lenders receive 25 per cent of the income, which corresponds to an average interest rate of 49 per cent p.a. A panel data analysis confirms theoretical predictions that interlinked loans contain an insurance component paid by the borrowers.

T1  - Toward Sustainability or Efficiency: The Case of Smallholder Coffee Farmers in Vietnam
AN  - 2548375305
AB  - This study attempts to uncover the truth behind an increasing number of smallholder farmers participating in sustainable coffee farming in Vietnam. Using stochastic frontier and cost-benefit analysis, a sample of 316 smallholder farmers in Dak Lak was chosen to analyze the economic impacts of sustainable and conventional coffee farming on farmers’ welfare. In addition, we conducted field observation and key informant interviews to describe several farming practices. The results highlight the fact that farmers’ decisions to participate in sustainable coffee farming are mainly driven by economic benefits. Sustainable farming is more cost-effective and profitable than conventional farming, despite the insignificant difference in production efficiency. Improvement of education, farming knowledge, and collective actions could mitigate negative effects of small-scale production for sustainable coffee farmers. Pesticide management, shade coffee encouragement, and reduction of excessive fertilization, over-irrigation, and unproductive coffee varieties are recommended for sustainable development of the sector.

T1  - Menjejaki amalan model perniagaan koperasi pekebun kecil sawit di Malaysia
AN  - 2488677498
AB  - Koperasi pekebun kecil diwujudkan sebagai inisiatif bagi memperkasa kebajikan sosioekonomi pekebun kecil dan mengurangkan pergantungan terhadap pihak luar. Kurangnya pergantungan terhadap pihak luar akan meningkatkan aspirasi dan memelihara kepentingan pekebun kecil. Hal yang demikian kerana gerakan koperasi merupakan usaha kolektif individu-individu yang sama latar belakang dan matlamat untuk menjaga kepentingan secara bersama. Objektif kajian ini adalah untuk mengenal pasti dan mendeskripsi model-model koperasi yang melibatkan pekebun kecil sawit yang wujud di Malaysia. Teknik temubual digunakan bagi melaksanakan proses pengumpulan data kajian. Informan kajian melibatkan wakil lembaga pengarah atau pengurusan daripada enam buah koperasi berkaitan pekebun kecil sawit. Pemilihan koperasi dibuat menggunakan kaedah persampelan bertujuan dengan menghadkan carian informan berpotensi berdasarkan senarai koperasi yang terlibat dalam sektor pertanian kelapa sawit.  Penemuan kajian merumuskan tiga bentuk model perniagaan koperasi yang dianggotai oleh pekebun sawit kecil di Malaysia iaitu model koperasi pekebun kecil sawit agensi FELDA dan FELCRA serta model milik pekebun bebas. Ketiga-tiga model koperasi ini mempunyai teras pelaksanaan koperasi iaitu menjaga kepentingan para ahlinya. Amalan koperasi berdasarkan model-model yang dikenal pasti ini memberi penumpuan kepada aktiviti keusahawanan, pengurangan risiko dan juga mengoptimumkan keuntungan. Kesemua amalan ini adalah bagi membantu para ahli memperolehi faedah dalam bentuk pendapatan dividen, perkongsian maklumat dan pengetahuan. Pemahaman berkaitan model-model koperasi yang ada dapat membantu memperkemas amalan pengurusan operasi sedia ada dalam usaha memberi faedah secara berkesan dan mapan kepada ahlinya.Alternate abstract:Discovering the practices of palm oil smallholders’ cooperative business models in Malaysia
AbstractSmallholder cooperatives were created as an initiative to empower the socio-economic welfare of smallholders and reduce reliance on outsiders. The lesser the dependence on external parties will increase the aspiration and preserves the interests of smallholders. This is because cooperative movements are the collective effort of individuals of equal background that aims to safeguard mutual interest. The objective of this study is to identify and describe the cooperative models involving smallholders in Malaysia. Interview techniques were used to carry out the data collection process. The informants comprise of the representatives of the board or management of six cooperatives related to palm oil smallholder. The selection of cooperatives was made using a purposive sampling method where the potential informants were chosen based on the list of cooperatives involved in the palm oil sector. The study findings summarize three forms of cooperative business models comprised of smallholders in Malaysia namely the smallholder cooperatives model of FELDA and FELCRA agencies and the models of independent planters. These three cooperative models have the core principle of cooperative implementation that is to safeguard the interests of its members. Based on the three identified models, the cooperative practices is found to be focuses on entrepreneurial activities, risk reduction and optimization of profits. All of these practices are to help members to earn benefits in the form of dividend income, information sharing and knowledge accumulation. An understanding of the existing cooperative models in Malaysia can help streamline current operation management practices to ensure delivery of effective and sustainable benefits to its members.

T1  - The Living University in Relation to Popular Classes in Brazil. A Critical Analysis of Higher Education Policies
AN  - 2461148631; EJ1226546
AB  - This article discusses the relationship between university and popular classes as an alternative to the privatist tendencies of higher education policies, as well as science and technology, in Brazil, in this period of transition from the neo-developmental project to the deepening of counter-reforms, which started in the 1990s. The subject is developed from bibliographical and documental research (Brazilian legislations), besides testimonies from Brazilian researchers who have worked together with family farmers, smallholders, settlers, and recyclable material collectors that are organised in cooperatives and associations. Our analyses are structured in dialogue with the hypothesis of dysfunctionality of the university. A review of higher education and science and technology policies is carried out and considered in regard to inclusion and the relationship with the popular classes. Our focus is on the first decade of the twenty-first century, a brief period of neo-developmentalism that ended with the deepening of the current counter-reforms. Initially, it is analyzed the higher education. Then, it is discussed the trends in Science and Technology policy. This is followed by analyzes of the relationship between university and popular classes, an alternative that is carried out contradictorily. It is concluded that the University recreates itself by contributing to popular classes.

T1  - The essential role of farm capital in the sustainability of smallholder farms in West Java (Indonesia)
AN  - 2427345487
AB  - Smallholder farms represent the largest population of dairy cattle farms in Indonesia. Dairy activities can play an important role to secure the livelihood of smallholder farms. However, small farms face several constraints and challenges to be sustainable in the future. To assess the sustainability of smallholder dairy farms and to understand in what conditions farms are more sustainable, we conducted a study in two districts of the West Java Province. Our method was based on participatory meetings that allowed us to identify “critical features” of the local farming systems, and associated indicators. From discussions with local stakeholders, we proposed 6 “strategic indicators” of sustainability. Five of those indicators were related to the social and economic dimensions of sustainability, which appeared to be crucial in the local context. To assess the sustainability of farms based on those 6 indicators, we collected secondary data from the local cooperative, and carried out a formal field survey to 355 farmers from May to August 2015. Results showed that the most sustainable farms were those who had highest capital and diversified activity. Farms which had low capital but had additional activity were more sustainable than specialized ones. Whereas the level of farm income appears to be linked directly to farm capital, pluriactivity contributes to reduce risks related to dairy business and to gain benefit from synergies between activities. In the future, policies and projects to enhance farm capital and farmers’ pluriactivity will be needed to support the sustainability of smallholder farms.Alternate abstract:
Les petites exploitations constituent la majorité des fermes laitières en Indonésie. Les activités laitières jouent un rôle important pour assurer leur subsistance. Cependant, ces exploitations font face à plusieurs contraintes et défis pour être durables à l’avenir. Pour évaluer et identifier les conditions de la durabilité des exploitations laitières, une étude a été menée dans deux districts de la province de Java Ouest. Notre méthode repose sur des entretiens participatifs qui nous ont permis d’identifier des « points critiques » des systèmes d’élevage locaux, et de proposer des indicateurs de durabilité associés. À partir de réunions avec les acteurs locaux, nous avons identifié 6 indicateurs stratégiques. Parmi ces 6 indicateurs, 5 relèvent des dimensions sociales et économiques de la durabilité qui sont essentielles dans le contexte local. Pour évaluer la durabilité des exploitations à l’aide de ces 6 indicateurs et comprendre les facteurs qui expliquent les différences dans ces indicateurs, nous avons conduit une enquête auprès de 355 agriculteurs de mai à août 2015. Ces données ont été complétées par des données secondaires fournis par la coopérative sur ces 355 élevages. Les résultats ont montré que les exploitations les plus durables étaient celles qui possédaient le capital le plus élevé et qui étaient pluriactives. Pour les fermes avec un faible capital, celles qui étaient diversifiées étaient plus durables que celles qui étaient spécialisées. Alors que le niveau de capital impacte directement le niveau de revenu, la pluriactivité contribue à réduire les risques liés aux activités laitières et permet de bénéficier des synergies entre les activités. Notre étude souligne l’importance des programmes de crédit en appui aux exploitations et des programmes d’appui à la diversification des ménages ruraux pour accroître la durabilité des petites exploitations.

T1  - THE EFFECT OF MICROCREDIT ON TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY OF SMALLHOLDER RICE FARMERS IN IKOT EKPENE AGRICULTURAL ZONE, AKWA IBOM STATE, NIGERIA
AN  - 2422404471
AB  - The study analyzed the effect of microcredit on technical efficiency of smallholder rice farmers in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. The specific objectives were to; describe the socio-economic profile of the rice farmers in the study area; identify microcredit sources accessed by rice farmers; analysis the factors that determine access to credit as well as examine the influence of credit and other factors on technical efficiency. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed to sample the rice farmers in the study area. Data obtained was analyzed using descriptive statistics, profit regression and stochastic production frontier. Results showed that 64.7% were male, 68.2% were married, and about 96.5% were literate. The mean household size was 7 persons per households, with a mean farm size of 2.19 hectares, 38.8% had 6-10years of farming experience, and 83.5% belonged to an association and earned an annual income of above N400,000. The main source of credit accessed by the smallholder rice farmers is the cooperative society. Extension contact, farm size, farming experience and household size were the significant factors that determined the access to credit by the smallholder farmers. Quantity of seed, farm size and family labour were the significant variables that had a significant effect on the output of rice at 1% and 5%. The value of the returns to scale (RTS = 0.914) shows that the farmers were producing at the decreasing return to scale (Stage II). The mean technical efficiency was 0.64 with minimum and maximum efficiencies of 0.09 and 0.92. Respondent's educational level, household size, farming experience and credit were the significant variables that increased the technical efficiency of the smallholder rice farmers. The study recommends that smallholder rice farmer should increase access to credit per production season, since the access to credit has efficiency increasing effect

T1  - Quantifying Farmers’ Initiatives and Capacity to Cope with Drought: A Case Study of Xinghe County in Semi-Arid China
AN  - 2323905727
AB  - [...]tenants have more choices and can cultivate sunflower, beetroot, and other crops that can earn more money (such as cabbage and spinach, etc.).

[...]the results show greater individual differences in allocation of resources, and the tenants scored higher than the smallholders did in terms of the initiatives taken to deal with drought (Figure 2).

[...]with the changes in the market economy and local policies, the farmer’s planting structure and family income structure will also change, which will in turn affect the ability of farmers to cope with drought.

[...]according to this research method, the changes in farmers’ capacity to cope with drought under different driving forces in the future (mainly the market economy and social policy) deserve further study.

After a disaster, people form a collective consciousness and a sense of belonging through active cooperation and voluntary service, which improves the ability to cope with drought in the region [69,70].

[...]it is crucial to explore the changes in farmers’ ability to cope with drought at different stages of disasters and the factors that improve regional drought resistance level.

Increasing attention is being paid to integrated risk governance, which emphasizes involving multiple stakeholders, adopting multiple scales, and developing multiple measures [78].

[...]taking into account farmers’ initiatives in combating drought is not only conducive to a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of their capacity to cope with drought but is also helpful to policymakers in understanding farmers’ needs and priorities, and in turn, in formulating appropriate policies [79,80] to foster collaboration between farmers and the state to achieve a common purpose, thereby increasing the consilience of the entire social-ecological system.

T1  - Factors influencing the resilience of smallholder livestock farmers to agricultural drought in South Africa: Implication for adaptive capabilities
AN  - 2315011177
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the factors that influence the resilience of smallholder farming households in the Northern Cape province of South Africa. This study utilised primary data collected from 207 smallholder livestock farmers and the probit model. The study contributes to the existing literature by constructing an agricultural drought resilience index (ADRI) as an outcome variable in order to determine the factors that influence the resilience of smallholder farmers to agricultural drought. The result revealed that only 9% of the smallholder livestock farmers were resilient to agricultural drought. Farming households with access to credit; farmers who received assistance from the government (such as training and feed) during drought and farmers who are part of a co-operative proved to be more resilient to agricultural drought. The policy implication of the findings of this study is for government and key role players in the industry to target disadvantaged smallholder farmers to build their resilience by enhancing their persistence and adaptability. Some of the assistance could be in the form of supplying fodder, strengthening access to agricultural credit and farm input, enhancing smallholder farmers’ involvement in agricultural drought resilience activities by giving training and disseminating information. Finally, yet importantly, there is a need to enhance the resilience of farmers by educating farmers about the importance of getting involved in cooperatives and social networks. Furthermore, the findings of this study will help policymakers and stakeholders to formulate strategies and policy interventions that will boost smallholder farmers’ resilience to agricultural drought.

T1  - Financial risks in Rwandan smallholder broiler production
AN  - 2306176668
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to determine the stochastic net present value (NPV) of a model smallholder poultry operation in Rwanda under production and market uncertainty.Design/methodology/approachA discounted cash flow calculator was used to determine the NPV of operator investments and operating cash flows, including time, materials and capital. Broiler production data, market prices and variable input costs were collected from 125 smallholder operations in the Musanze District, Rwanda. These data were combined with a historical price index tracking the inflation rate of Rwanda’s currency. Policies including overstocking, technical support repayment scheduling, selling broilers at a spot market price, using marketing contracts and selling poultry manure were compared using non-parametric paired comparisons and stochastic dominance.FindingsRisk-neutral and risk-averse producers would prefer overstocking, delaying repayment of technical support services and selling manure to status quo operational policy. No differences were observed between the option to sell birds at spot market prices or through contracts.Research limitations/implicationsThis analysis demonstrates how individual managerial or an intervention in smallholder broiler production affects financial performance.Practical implicationsTo mitigate risk associated with this novel enterprise, producers should consider overstocking birds. If local markets for manure were developed, the risks faced by new or beginning poultry operators could be mitigated.Originality/valueA stochastic, discounted cash flow model calculator was used to determine the NPV and discounted payback period of operator investments and operating cash flows, including time, materials and capital.

T1  - Use and perceptions of alternative economic activities among smallholder coffee farmers in Huehuetenango and El Quiché departments in Guatemala
AN  - 2185901121
AB  - In the past two decades, Mesoamerican smallholder coffee farmers have had to confront several stressors and shocks, such as price crises and natural disasters, with debilitating impacts on the viability of their livelihoods. More recently, many farmers have suffered crop losses in the wake of the spread of coffee leaf rust disease, and researchers are predicting that some areas will become less suitable for coffee growing in the near future as a result of climate change. For these reasons, many have called for the promotion of livelihood diversification as an additional component of rural development programs. This study uses thematic analysis of transcripts from 15 interviews with members of a regional Guatemalan coffee cooperative, Asociación Barillense de Agricultores, based on four different interview guides. Coffee remains the primary livelihood strategy of the respondents, whereas most other activities appear to offer relatively small contributions to incomes, with the exception of honey and a small sewing shop. Some of the farmer responses reflect coping mechanisms rather than risk management. The study also identified other themes mediating diversification, including income-smoothing, optimization, familiarity, social networks, and influences from external actors.

T1  - Determinants of the competitiveness of smallholder African indigenous vegetable farmers in high-value agro-food chains in Kenya: A multivariate probit regression analysis
AN  - 2173487229
AB  - Smallholder farmers are excluded from efficient and effective participation in high-value agro-food market chains due to major competitiveness constraints and several market failures along these chains. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the competitiveness of smallholder farmers in a more coordinated and sustainable way that promote their effective and efficient participation in high-value agro-food market chains. In particular, the study aims at determining the main role of households’ capitals, institutional, and access-related factors in conditioning the decision of smallholder farmers of African indigenous vegetables (AIVs) to access pillars of competitiveness in high-value market chains (HVMCs). For this purpose, a unique household-level data from a total of 1232 rural and peri-urban AIV-producing households were surveyed, and the data obtained were analysed by using a multivariate probit model.The results suggest that about two thirds of smallholder AIV farmers had access to at least one pillar of competitiveness in HVMCs. The model results show the presence of inter-dependency of household level decisions to access multiple pillars of competitiveness in HVMCs. Furthermore, the results also reveal that coping with shocks, coupled with access to information on market prices and warnings of unexpected events, contract farming, certification and modern irrigation technologies are the main conditioning factors to the access of the pillars of competitiveness by smallholder farmers.The promotion and implementation of a well-founded mobile phone-based information access platforms, as well as effective and efficient livelihood strategies that support smallholder farmers to access pillars of competitiveness, is of critical importance towards overcoming the major competitiveness constraints along high-value agro-food chains.

T1  - Land, development and contract farming on the Guatemalan oil palm frontier
AN  - 2159127478
AB  - Integration of smallholder agriculture into oil palm production schemes has been advocated as a strategy for rural poverty reduction in the global South, including Guatemala, where the crop had been promoted through a contentious government programme. This study, set in Guatemala's northern lowlands, challenges the official narrative that smallholder oil palm cultivation catalyses rural development and deters peasant land sales. Results indicate that oil palm expansion is accelerating land sales and provides minimal benefits, namely non-inclusive and precarious jobs. The host community is becoming increasingly susceptible to global market volatility, as oil palm puts pressure on subsistence farming and eliminates other livelihood options.

T1  - The social construction of “shared growth”: Zambia Sugar and the uneven terrain of social benefit
AN  - 2158151582
AB  - Recent years have witnessed a growing trend in agricultural investment and large‐scale farmland acquisition in the Global South and a rapid expansion of scholarship and public debate over the nature, consequences, and desirability of these trends. The polarization of this debate into “win/lose” narratives raises the question of whether, and under what conditions, the logic of capital accumulation driving farmland acquisition and investment can engender broad‐based social benefits akin to “shared growth.” This paper sheds light on this question through a detailed look at the recent expansion of Zambia Sugar's Nakambala Estate in Mazabuka, Zambia. We explore outcomes linked to two of the most prominent pathways through which social benefits are said to accrue: smallholder incorporation and employment. Findings demonstrate the unevenness of outcomes linked to both pathways, with the concrete benefits both claimed and observed through some measures quickly eroding under the weight of alternative performance metrics. The unevenness produced by the intensification of capitalist relations is manifested not just between those differentially positioned with respect to the incoming investment (“outgrower,” “employee,” and “land loser”) but within each of those conditions. This ambiguity opens spaces for competing representations of the promises and pitfalls of these processes, while highlighting the shaky ground on which shared growth and inclusive business agendas stand.

T1  - Outgrower schemes, livelihoods and response pathways on the Zambian ‘sugarbelt’
AN  - 2162999801
AB  - In critical agrarian studies, the connections between large-scale agricultural investments and outgrower schemes are strong, but evidence on which model produces improved livelihood outcomes remains relatively weak. This paper examines livelihood impacts in two differently structured outgrower schemes under Zambia Sugar Plc – ZaSPlc, a subsidiary of Illovo Sugar Plc. The first scheme centrally controls land through an integrated company, renting out sugarcane plots to smallholders whilst acting as an intermediary. The second scheme amalgamates individual smallholder plots of land to form a contiguous block-farm managed by a ZaSPlc intermediary, integrating smallholders as shareholders. We identify the former scheme as producing greater livelihood impacts across financial capital and other dynamics but emphasise that these remain low quality and fail to produce significant path-changing gains for households. Analysis of livelihood groups and strategies, livelihood contributions of LaSAIs and sugarcane uptake, and livelihood response pathways reflect causes and consequences of differences in the evolution, operation, and integration of outgrower schemes. One outcome is the production of narrow as opposed to broad-based livelihoods. Livelihood diversification away from sugarcane schemes are forged within land-based and agrarian activities and show that smallholders do not always switch to profit-maximising strategies. Our findings show that greater attention must be paid to the role of institutional arrangements and local conditions in unfolding outcomes for land and water relations, and how emerging relationships shape inclusivity of an agricultural investment. Thus, outgrower arrangements that ensure commodity production alongside alternative farmer activities that boost livelihoods are thus strengthened for this purpose.

AB  - When they pooled their collective experience to make a flood-risk map, the result was essentially the same as what we scientists would make with hydrology and watershed measurements.

In 2009, I was selected as a lead author on a report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change about how communities can manage the risks associated with extreme weather.

In 2016, farmers, anthropologists and climate scientists embarked on a collaboration to develop climate information that would be useful for smallholders who raise cattle and grow vegetables, maize (corn) and potatoes.

T1  - Sustainably improving Kenya's coffee production needs more participation of younger farmers with diversified income
AN  - 2153611016
AB  - Kenya's Arabica coffee is highly rated in the world and is a major source of income for over half a million smallholder farmers. Production has declined by 50% over the past 25 years despite efforts by initiatives. This study tries to unravel what drives coffee production in Kenya. Data were collected on six cooperatives through household interviews and discussions with farmers, cooperative officials, and key informants. Yields ranged from ten to 3889 kg/ha/year, averaged 474 kg/ha/year and were positively correlated with intensity of crop management (r = 0.09, P < 0.05). Coffee represented about 25–50% of total household income. The oldest farmers (average 63 years) were poorer, had less diversified income sources and managed coffee less intensively than younger farmers. Intensity of management differed among cooperatives and was positively correlated with trust in the cooperative (r = 0.209, P < 0.001). Households that received credit from marketers were 30% more likely to use fertilizers than other households. We show that the yield gap can be closed by existing practices, and intensification is influenced by household characteristics and services received. We conclude that increasing the participation of young farmers in coffee production and creating an enabling environment for intensification can have a positive and sustainable effect on national production.

T1  - Explaining variation in the economic value of irrigation water using psychological capital: a case study from Ndumo B and Makhathini, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
AN  - 2135080007
AB  - This study investigates the economic value of irrigation water using data collected from 200 smallholder producers in Makhathini and Ndumo areas, KwaZulu-Natal.The study accounts for psychological capital (individual mind-set and attitude affecting motivation to take initiatives) as an important aspect of farm management. This concept focuses more on the 'soft' aspects of farm management, which have not been adequately studied in the context of smallholder farming. A sustainable livelihoods framework is employed as a conceptual framework and the role of psychological capital is integrated to explain the variation in water values. The study employs the residual valuation method to estimate water values, principal component analysis to generate an index for psychological capital, and the general linear model to explain variation in water values. The findings suggest that variation in water values was mainly influenced by the location of the farmer, farmer type, physical capital, social capital, land size, farming experience, crop type and psychological capital. The results reinforce the importance of institutional arrangements and collective bargaining as an important element of managing a smallholder farm to increase the economic value of water. To build and develop positive psychological capital for smallholders, it is recommended that government should re-visit the usual model of 'hand-outs' (input, finance). It is time to re-consider direct farmer support that entails being heavily involved in their day-to-day activities (i.e., purchasing inputs and running the irrigation schemes on their behalf). Going forward, the focus should rather be on enabling them to change their behaviour to be self-reliant and own their own destiny through on-farm and off-farm economic activities. Moreover, government and other development partners have to understand the long-term behavioural impact (on farmers) of what they do, for instance, entrenching expectations.

T1  - The value components of contract farming in contemporary capitalism
AN  - 2111045010
AB  - Contract farming (CF) has generally been understood as, essentially, a market institution—by both (approving) “mainstream” and (critical) “radical” perspectives. Analyses of relations of production have, meanwhile, tended towards a problematic “peasantist” frame, where contracts undermine farmer “autonomy” in processes of “flexible” corporate agro‐industrial restructuring. This paper argues that a materialist analysis of CF from within capital–labour relations offers a stronger conceptual foundation for re‐synthesizing questions of market‐power. It first argues that radical notions of “peasant subsumation” conceptually mirror Marx's “formal subsumption of capital” but underplay dynamics of “real subsumption” accompanying capitalism's wider development. Drawing on the “petty commodity production” concept, it then argues that CF's “flexibility” rests in its differential content. CF's fungibility to contradictory movements of “integration” and “dispersion” enables it to emphasize different methods of surplus appropriation under shifting conditions; each corresponding to a different dominant social tendency. On the one hand, conditions of market expansion inspire integration for relative surplus appropriation through raised productivity, and CF tends to act as a “tool of proletarianization” in the wider centralization of capital. On the other, conditions of contraction motivate the dispersal of unvalorized capital, prompting efforts to raise absolute surplus appropriation, and CF tends to act as a “tool of differentiation” to concentrate agricultural capital.

T1  - A Two-Step Econometric Estimation of Covariates of Side Selling: The Case of Coffee Cooperatives in Southwest Ethiopia
AN  - 2067209277
AB  - Despite their apparent economic benefit to smallholder farmers, cooperatives are vulnerable to the problem of side selling. Using cross-sectional household data and Cragg’s regression model, we identified the determinants of side selling by coffee cooperative farmers in southwest Ethiopia. The bootstrapping technique was applied to extract average partial effects from the model coefficients. Certified, elder and educated farmers who have off-farm income and trust in the cooperative leadership have been found to side-sell significantly less. Nonetheless, cooperative group size and late payment favoured more side selling. Based on these findings, possible interventions are highlighted for improving cooperative members’ commitment and the performance of coffee cooperatives in the region.

T1  - Adoption of new technologies by smallholder farmers: the contributions of extension, research institutes, cooperatives, and access to cash for improving tef production in Ethiopia
AN  - 2037260248
AB  - Agricultural intensification and extensification are standard responses to ecological and economic vulnerability among smallholder communities. Climate change has exacerbated this vulnerability and thrown the complexity of and critical need for managing a healthy natural resource base while increasing on-farm productivity into sharp light. Sustainable intensification is one of many mechanisms for accomplishing this balancing act. This study examines the adoption of sustainable intensification practices, namely input packages focused on tef row planting—designed to boost yield and promote more efficient use of inputs. This study utilized a mix methods approach to survey 115 smallholder farmers in the South Wollo zone of the Amhara region in Ethiopia. This study found that cash and capital, more so than contact with the AIS, influenced farmers’ decisions to adopt row planting input packages. Khat production was an important source of cash for inputs and was more likely to be available to farmers with irrigation schemes. Long-term, farmers who cultivate khat may not successfully engage in SI, as khat replaces traditional food crop production in the region. Yet, for farmers who do not grow khat, long-term investment in SI practices is unlikely unless access to affordable credit options is improved.

T1  - Assessing multi-level drivers of adaptation to climate variability and water insecurity in smallholder irrigation systems
AN  - 2088061845
AB  - Smallholder agriculturalists employ a range of strategies to adapt to climate variability. These adaptive strategies include decisions to plant different seed varieties, changes to the array of cultivated crops, and shifts in planting dates. Smallholder access to irrigation water is crucial to the adoption of such strategies, and uncertainty of water availability may prove to be a stimulating force in a smallholder’s decision to adjust their on-farm practices. Within smallholder irrigation systems, attributes at multiple levels influence water availability and collective action, and in the process play a role in adaptation: community-level governance institutions may influence trust in others and the ability to overcome appropriation and provisioning dilemmas, and, at the household-level, the availability of irrigation water and socioeconomic and demographic factors may influence farmer willingness to take on the risk of altering their on-farm practices. In this study we investigate smallholder adaptation in Kenya from multiple levels. Specifically, we identify the role of household- and community-level characteristics in shaping smallholder experimentation with different seed varieties. Standard ordinary least squares and logistic regressions are constructed to assess the influence of these interactions on smallholder adaptation. We further discuss the ability of smallholders to respond to poor water provisioning. Among the study’s findings is evidence that smallholders are more willing to employ adaptive measures if they have a limited capacity to irrigate.

T1  - Soil conservation practices and production efficiency of smallholder farms in Central China
AN  - 2064090428
AB  - The aim of this paper is to evaluate and analyze the impact of adoption of soil conservation practices (SCPs) on the technical efficiency of smallholder rice producers in Central China. We address self-selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity problems by estimating a switching regression model for the adoption decision function and separate stochastic production frontiers for SCP and Conventional farms while allowing for production inefficiency. SCP farms exhibit statistically higher average technical efficiency than Conventional farms. Education, extension services, membership in cooperatives, access to credit, and alternative income sources are positively and significantly associated with technical efficiency for both groups. Conventional farms display higher partial output elasticity for land, while only SCP farms show significant elasticity for capital.

T1  - Smallholder preferences and willingness-to-pay measures for microcredit: Evidence from Sichuan province in China
TT  - Smallholder preferences
AN  - 2091100847
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine smallholders’ preferences and willingness to pay for microcredit products with varying attribute combinations, in order to contribute to the debate on the optimal design of rural microcredit.Design/methodology/approachData used in this study are based on a discrete choice experiment from 552 randomly selected respondents. Mixed logit and latent class models are estimated to examine the choice probability and sources of preference heterogeneity. Endogenous attribute attendance models are applied to account for attribute non-attendance (ANA) phenomenon, focusing on separate non-attendance probability as well as joint non-attendance probability.FindingsThe results demonstrate that preference heterogeneity and ANA exist in the smallholder farmers’ microcredit choices. Averagely, smallholder farmers prefer longer credit period, smaller credit size, lower transaction costs and lower interest rate. Guarantor collateral method and installment repayment positively affect their preferences as well. Moreover, respondents are found to be willing to pay more for the attributes they consider important. The microcredit providers are able to attract new customers under the current interest rates, if the combination of attributes is appropriately adjusted.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the debate by assessing the preference trade-off of different microcredit attributes more comprehensively than in previous analyses, by taking preference heterogeneity and ANA into account.

T1  - Socio-economic factors affecting the rate of adoption of acacia plantations by smallholders in Indonesia
AN  - 2082633074
AB  - Acacia plantations have an important role in increasing the reforestation rate and fulfilling the market demand for processed timber in some Asian countries. This study investigates the factors affecting the time-to-adoption of Acacia spp. by smallholders in different landscapes of Indonesia. We use discrete time duration analysis and data on time of first adoption by 430 landholders from Yogyakarta and the outer regions of South Sumatra and West Kalimantan. Results show that, on average, the time to adoption among smallholders in Yogyakarta was 3.1 years, while that for the outer regions was considerably longer at 10.8 years. Faster rates of acacia adoption were associated with smallholders growing other timber species, having larger land holdings, land acquired from inheritance (compared to via the market), being younger, having an on-farm occupation, and having experience of contracts used in commercial forestry. Changes in the reforestation schemes had limited impact on the adoption rate of acacia, although some schemes marginally decreased or increased the adoption rate. This could be associated with limited availability of acacia seedlings provided by government, which prioritizes seedlings of other commercial tree species, and changes in the contract mechanisms. The mode of extension, such as farmer-to-farmer learning and forest extension agents, also affected adoption.

T1  - Local community's preferences for accepting a forestry partnership contract to grow pulpwood in Indonesia: A choice experiment study
AN  - 2069969943
AB  - Forestry partnership schemes have been deployed to integrate industrial plantations' and local communities' interests in forest resource management. However, the unsatisfactory impacts of the scheme lead to both parties reassessing the value of the partnership schemes. This article explores local communities' willingness to remain in or opt-out of the partnership schemes designed to grow pulpwood in Indonesia, and investigates their preferences for accepting the modified contract attributes. The contract attributes include contract length, labor participation, insurance, training, road improvement and income. A choice experiment approach was used to estimate preferences of 287 smallholders, of which half were participating with the timber industry under Company-Community Partnership schemes. The results show that a bundle of the contract attributes that could increase local communities' utility are provision of road improvement, higher expected income, and higher timber production insurance. Greater incentives are required to compensate smallholders' loss of utility due to longer contract length and monitoring planted areas. The preferences vary significantly depending on smallholders' participation status in the scheme but not land tenure status. The continuity of the partnership schemes is challenged by a significant number of respondents always rejecting the contract option. The implication of the findings is that designing a bundle of contract attributes focusing on a promotive social safeguard approach likely keeps the participating smallholders in the schemes.

T1  - Factors influencing intensification of dairy production systems in Ethiopia
AN  - 2067646996
AB  - Little is known of how dairy intensification driven by socioeconomic issues and dairy development efforts works as well as the challenges of changing production systems in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. A study was carried out to analyze factors determining intensification of dairy production systems and the present status of market-oriented smallholder dairy operations in Ethiopia. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with 200 dairy farmers. The results revealed that 77% of respondents reared improved/crossbred dairy cows, 53.5% acquired good manure management besides crossbreeding, and 44% of the sampled rural households were involved in cultivating improved forage crops and crossbreeding practices. The binary logistic regression model output showed that herd size, farmland size, dairy training, and cooperative membership had significant effects on cultivating improved forages. Dairy production system, dairying experience, and herd size were significantly associated with rearing only crossbred dairy cows. Farmland size, dairy system, and awareness of manure handling were significantly associated with practicing good manure management. Further analysis of the extent of intensification indicated that mean daily milk yield per cow and household milk market share were significantly related to crossbreeding and manure management practices in combination. Thus, production systems–based dairy breeding and manure management, related input supply, and alternative formal marketing options are the key attributes of the intensification and improved productivity of smallholder dairy production that need to be considered while designing policy and intervention.

T1  - Remembered resilience: oral history narratives and community resilience in agroforestry systems
AN  - 2031423965
AB  - In this article, I consider how local oral history narratives provide smallholder farmers with both material and symbolic resources in adapting to climate change. I draw from the case study of an agrarian village in Madagascar that was struck by a destructive category 3 cyclone. In the weeks following the storm, oral history knowledge occupied an increasingly visible role within the community, as younger farmers interacted with elders to hear tales of past storms. Through these shared accounts, people discussed specific techniques on how to cope with environmental uncertainty. They also created a sense of shared history, which provided individuals across generations an entry point into the local historical record. Overall, the process of sharing oral history accounts can contribute to community resilience, with resiliency encompassing not only technical or ecological factors, but also the more affective realms of shared legacies, hope and belonging.

T1  - From worker to peasant and then to entrepreneur? Land reform and agrarian change in the Saïss (Morocco)
AN  - 2068022942
AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyze the emerging entrepreneurial practices on family farms in two agrarian reform cooperatives in Morocco. Their emergence can be explained by the constant negotiation of multiple and sometimes even antagonistic logics within these farms in a context of rapid agrarian change and the juxtaposition of capitalistic, entrepreneurial and peasant farms in the same area. Through their engagement as workers or sharecroppers in the different types of farms and as household members on the family farm, the young farmers from the dismantled agrarian cooperatives participate actively in the transformation of farming modes. The porosity of the peasant and entrepreneurial worlds is the main lesson we draw from our study. There is a subtle process of hybridization between the peasant and entrepreneurial modes of farming, resulting in a wide range of profiles. If we only focus on the political discourse, the trend towards capitalistic and entrepreneurial modes of farming seems inescapable. Nevertheless, our study stresses the resistance of peasant modes of farming that can blend with a ‘modern’ perception of agriculture.

T1  - Climate variability, perceptions and political ecology: Factors influencing changes in pesticide use over 30 years by Zimbabwean smallholder cotton producers
AN  - 2037056331
AB  - Pesticides represent a potential public health hazard of note in farming communities. Accumulating evidence indicates that some pesticides used in agriculture act as hormone disrupters, with the potential to result in chronic health effects. Despite such a growing evidence base, pesticides remain the preferred method of pest control in agriculture worldwide. In many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, usage is on the increase. This qualitative study assessed changes in the usage of pesticides by Zimbabwean smallholder cotton farmers in the past 30 years. Farmers reported an increase in the usage of pesticides, specifically insecticides, since the early 1980s. An increase in pest populations was also reported. The findings suggested a bi-directional causal relationship between the increase in pest population and the increase in pesticide use. Factors which emerged to have collectively impacted on the changes include climate variability, limited agency on the part of farmers, power dynamics involving the government and private cotton companies and farmers’ perceptions and practices. An Integrated Pest Management Policy for Zimbabwe is recommended to facilitate integration of chemical controls with a broad range of other pest control tactics. Continuous farmer education and awareness raising is further recommended, since farmers’ perceptions can influence their practices.

T1  - Price premiums, payment delays, and default risk: understanding developing country farmers’ decisions to market through a cooperative or a private trader
AN  - 2033698047
AB  - Smallholder farmers in developing countries face a competitive disadvantage in modern agricultural supply chains. Joint marketing through cooperatives is a potential tool to mitigate these disadvantages; yet cooperatives’ success in these settings is uneven at best. We develop an analytical model to study a farmer's choice of selling to a private trader who pays cash on delivery but may exercise market power or a cooperative that promises a price premium but delays payment and carries a concomitant risk of default. In the presence of impatient and risk‐averse farmers, we show that these factors can severely limit smallholder patronage of a cooperative, despite a promised price premium. We then construct and parameterize a simulation model to fit a profile of heterogeneous farmers within a prototype developing‐country village, and study the optimal decisions of farmers regarding marketing through a cooperative versus a private trader. Results suggest that modest improvements in either timeliness of payment or probability of default can induce a substantial increase in a cooperative's market share and economic viability. Extending the simulation analysis to a dynamic setting shows how implementing reasonable policies to improve a cooperative's payment timeliness and default probability can markedly improve its growth trajectory.

AB  - Contract farming (CF), an institutional innovation, can reduce transaction costs and solve market imperfections in many developing countries. This study compares productivity and technical efficiency (TE) of contract and independent producers of high yielding variety (HYV) paddy seed (a low‐value crop) and ginger (a high‐value crop) producers in a sample of smallholders in Nepal. We address the self‐selection into CF by using propensity score matching and translog stochastic frontier function to estimate our empirical model. Using farm‐level data from Nepal, our findings show that CF increased the average TE levels of HYV paddy seed producers from 87% to 94% and the average TE levels of ginger producers from 89% to 97%. Finally, we find that human capital and distance to the market increases the technical inefficiency of low‐value crop smallholders in Nepal. [EconLit citations: C21, O13, Q12].

T1  - Smallholder dairy cattle feeding technologies and practices in Tanzania: failures, successes, challenges and prospects for sustainability
AN  - 2022089636
AB  - In Tanzania, milk production under smallholder farming systems is season sensitive, fluctuations of feeds in both quantity and quality being the major driver. A dry season decline in milk production of over 40% due to feed scarcity is a common phenomenon. Adoption of improved feed production, conservation and utilization technologies and practices in dairy farming communities is poor. This review work was based on a key question which states "Why is adoption of improved dairy nutrition technologies and practices in Tanzania still poor despite being promoted for decades?". We have shown that major opportunities for curbing dry season animal feed shortage include on-farm optimization of production and use of high yielding pasture varieties including napier grass (Pennisetum purperium Schumach.) and leguminous fodder species. Crop residues in particular maize stover needs to be optimized for effective dry season feeding. The major reasons for low adoption of proven technologies include limited technical knowhow among smallholder dairy farmers augmented by limited extension services and technological costs. For enhancing sustainable uptake; we suggest promotion of on-farm research, public-private partnerships and dairy farmers' cooperative associations. These are vital for facilitating smooth access to information, investment capital, reliable inputs and markets among the smallholder dairy farmers.

T1  - Technical Efficiency of Rainfed and Irrigated Rice Production in Tanzania
AN  - 2020659933
AB  - Tanzania produces rice from two major ecologies, namely irrigated and rainfed lowland. Currently most of the rice is produced from the rainfed lowland but the country's National Rice Development Strategy (NRDS) hopes to reverse this trend. The NRDS aims to increase the rice production area for irrigated lowland ecology from 200 000 ha in 2008 to 390 000 ha by 2018, with productivity increasing from 2.13 t ha−1 in 2008 to 3.5 t ha−1 in 2018. This study evaluated the performance of irrigated and rainfed lowland rice production using technical efficiency. This paper estimates the technical efficiency of rice production in Tanzania for the irrigated and rainfed lowland ecologies. Data were collected from an irrigated site in Bagamoyo and a lowland rainfed site, Dakawa in the Morogoro area. The study found that the average technical efficiency of the irrigating farmers is 96% compared to an average 39% for the rainfed lowland system. For the irrigated system, there are no farmers with technical efficiency less than 80%. This high technical efficiency indicates that in order to achieve the rice production targets aspired to, the opportunity for increasing production therefore lies in changing the production technology.

Actuellement, la majeure partie du riz provient des plaines pluviales, mais la stratégie nationale de développement du riz (NRDS) du pays aspire à inverser cette tendance en augmentant la superficie rizicole irriguée de 200 000 ha en 2008 à 390 000 ha d’ici 2018, pour une productivité passant de 2.13 t ha−1 en 2008 à 3.5 t ha−1 en 2018. Cette étude a évalué la performance des plaines irriguées et pluviales—qui correspondent à deux écosystèmes bien distincts—en utilisant l’efficacité technique. Les données ont été recueillies à partir d’un site irrigué à Bagamoyo et d’un site pluvial, Dakawa dans la région de Morogoro. L’étude a révélé que l’efficacité technique moyenne des agriculteurs irrigués était de 96%, et de 39% en moyenne pour les systèmes de la plaine pluviale. Il n’y a pas d’agriculteurs irrigants ayant une efficacité technique inférieure à 80%. L’efficacité technique élevée indique que, pour atteindre les objectifs de production de riz, l’augmentation de la production réside donc par la modification de la technologie de production.

T1  - Strengthening collective action to improve marketing performance: evidence from farmer groups in Central Africa
AN  - 2008017060
AB  - Purpose: Several development organisations have implemented programs to enhance smallholder farmers' crop productivity and market access through collective action with mixed results. Therefore, this study examines the drivers of success of collective action initiatives as a pathway to improving farmers marketing performance using data from Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.Design/methodology/approach: This study uses primary data collected from 30 farmer groups through focus group discussions. These groups are assessed for differences in their marketing performance using descriptive and cluster analysis techniques.Findings: Most of the group members are poor (67%) and few are considered as rich (2%) or middle class (28%), while the rest are destitute. The destitute community members are often excluded from the groups due to their own passivity and inability to contribute financial resources for joint activities. Mature farmer groups with strong internal structures and greater participation in product bulking as well as formally organised groups with stable external links significantly have higher marketing performance.Practical implications: We recommend that for farmers to maximise the benefits of collective action, supportive policies are necessary to encourage the formation of groups and transform existing ones into business entities to access high-value markets and perhaps even export markets. Farmer groups need to intensify their market research to access ready and stable markets such as supermarkets and institutions with larger volumetric requirements.Theoretical implications: The study shows that collective action is important for smallholder farmers in developing countries to sustainably access markets and increase their marketing performance.Originality/Value: Few studies have examined how social capital and collective action are utilised to improve smallholder farmers marketing performance, particularly in Central Africa.

T1  - Agricultural Cooperatives and Investment in Organic Soil Amendments and Chemical Fertilizer in China
AN  - 2511814546
AB  - In this article, we develop a dynamic model to show how membership in agricultural cooperatives influences smallholder farmers' decisions to invest in organic soil amendments and chemical fertilizer. The model considers management decisions of heterogonous producers within an intertemporal framework, with the decision to join the cooperative assumed to be endogenous. Farm‐level data of apple farmers from three provinces in China are used to estimate the impact of cooperative membership on investment in organic soil amendments and chemical fertilizer. A recursive bivariate probit model that accounts for potential endogeneity of cooperative membership and selection bias is employed in the empirical analysis. The empirical results show that cooperative membership exerts a positive and statistically significant impact on the likelihood of investing in organic soil amendments. The findings also reveal that tenure security, human capital, farm size, and access to credit positively and significantly influence the probability of a farmer joining a cooperative and the likelihood of investing in soil quality measures.

T1  - Land ownership and technology adoption revisited: Improved maize varieties in Ethiopia
AN  - 2029416941
AB  - The lack of land ownership can discourage agricultural technology adoption, yet there is scarce evidence of the impact of land rental contracts on the adoption of improved crop varieties in developing countries. The current study investigates such impact using a nationally representative survey of Ethiopian maize farmers. In contrast to many previous studies, we show in a simple model that cash-renters are as likely to adopt improved maize varieties as owner-operators, while sharecroppers are more likely to adopt given that such varieties are profitable. Empirical analysis reveals a significant impact of sharecropping on improved maize variety adoption, and no significant impact from cash-rental, lending support to the above hypotheses. These results imply that improvements in land rental markets can potentially enhance household welfare through crop variety adoption in agrarian economies where land sales markets are incomplete or missing.

T1  - Applying Ostrom’s institutional analysis and development framework to soil and water conservation activities in north-western Ethiopia
AN  - 2012059578
AB  - Sustainable land management is of utmost importance in Ethiopia and relies on Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) measures collectively implemented by smallholders through participatory processes. This paper contributes systematic evidence on how SWC strategies are implemented and how participation is operationalized. Drawing upon inductive, qualitative research, we explore the design, implementation and evaluation of SWC activities, as they relate to Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, in order to determine how the activities can be made more appropriate, effective and sustainable. Findings show that on all levels of Ostrom's framework, there are shortcomings in the SWC institutions, which have to be addressed with more participatory approaches, a change from top-down to bottom-up measures, and economic incentives for farmers to invest in SWC measures instead of e.g. compulsory labor, and the integration of so far neglected groups like youth, women and the landless.

T1  - The cost effectiveness of payments for ecosystem services-Smallholders and agroforestry in Africa
AN  - 2012059015
AB  - Certain smaltholder farmers in parts of sub-Saharan Africa engage in conservation agriculture and participate in agroforestry ecosystem services schemes that generate additional on-farm revenues through payment for ecosystem services (PES). However, smallholder farmers that are inadequately compensated for the foregone income from agricultural production due to marginal ecosystem services provision have no incentive to participate. On the other hand, over-compensating participating farmers will also lead to PES schemes inefficiencies. Therefore, stakeholders are confronted with the challenge of evaluating farm-level interactions between agricultural production and ecosystem services' provision when making strategic decisions on the efficient level of compensation. We propose in this contribution to assess the efficiency of PES schemes by measuring the marginal cost of ecosystem services based on farm level bio-economic interactions. The quantitative assessment is based on a theoretical classification of the relationship between marketed agricultural output and ecosystem services into complementary, supplementary or competitive. We use a flexible transformation function and cross-sectional data on 120 surveyed smallholder farmers with agroforestry certification in rural Mount Kenya. The results suggest that the joint production (of agricultural output and ecosystem services) for a substantial number of smallholder farms in Kenya may not show a complementary relationship. The biophysical linkage between marketed outputs and ecosystem services strongly influences the marginal cost of ecosystem services. PES schemes could become more efficient if they would target smallholder farms based on the aforementioned classifications by offering a range of contracts to encourage competitive bidding.

T1  - Changing labour power on smallholder tea farms in Kenya
AN  - 1999858882
AB  - Informal wage workers on smallholder tea farms make important contributions to world export of tea. The literature on global production networks only recently began to pay more detailed attention to conceptualizing the role that labour plays in such networks and has so far focused mainly on industrial settings – not smallholder farming. Similarly, the literature on sustainability standards has focused on wage-workers in large-scale workplaces such as factories or plantations. This article seeks to remedy this lack of attention and make contributions to both literatures by arguing first, that labour agency in export-oriented smallholder tea production in developing countries may not be advanced much by the sustainability certifications demanded by Western buyers and second, that labour agency can nevertheless be present at ‘the margins’ of global production networks even though informal rural wage workers are most often assumed to lack both ‘structural’ and ‘associational’ power. These arguments are made on the basis of a case study of on-farm wage labour in smallholder tea production in Kenya. The article finds labour’s bargaining power to be stronger in some locations compared to others and that differences between locations can be fruitfully explored by looking not just at workers insertion into the vertical structures of the global production network but by also including more ‘horizontal’ dimensions relating to the local context in which smallholder tea production and on-farm wage-workers are embedded.

T1  - Beyond Proletarianisation: The Everyday Politics of Chinese Migrant Labour
AN  - 2806186916
AB  - [...]based on fieldwork in Yunnan province, I focus on a young generation of smallholders to highlight how autonomy from wage-work becomes central to the formation of their aspirations.

[...]it breaks with the tendency to only recognise the struggles of workers as a form of politics during overt forms of collective action, such as strikes or demonstrations.

Moving beyond proletarianisation, means broadening our repertoires of interpretation in order to articulate the not yet articulated political imaginaries found in the street and in the fields.

[...]the practices, aspirations, and livelihood arrangements of migrants become important, as they provide the seeds for alternative political imaginaries under ‘the new normal’ of precarious work.

When they became sick, exhausted, or unemployed, they return to Baicai or Kaoyan to recuperate and reduce their dependence on commodity markets, as they can survive through home-grown food and rearing livestock.

T1  - Where do tobacco farmers live: association between Kenyan tobacco farmers' livelihood selection decision and their accessibility to nearby economic centers
AN  - 2586481120
AB  - Background:
Prosperous economic livelihood described by industry is hallucination in Kenya, smallholder tobacco farmers are making small or no profits [1-4]. World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) Article 17 encourages viable alternative livelihoods for tobacco farmers. However, little evidence on how tobacco farmers make livelihood selection decisions exists. [5] Therefore, we examined tobacco farmers' livelihood selection decisions under different accessibility levels to nearby economic centers.
Methods:
527 smallholder tobacco farmers in Kenya from three main tobacco-growing regions participated in our 2016-2017 wave economic livelihood survey, among whom 345 participants are current growers and 287 have a partnership contract. Geo-economic data was matched to surveyed farmers' Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates to estimate each farmer's objective access to nearby economic centers. We examined the association between access to nearby economic centers and farmers' choice to grow tobacco and to grow tobacco under contract. Multivariate logistic regressions were adopted for models while controlling for social-economic status and self-reported activity in nearby economic centers. We also examined these models with regional variables fixed.
Results:
Tobacco farmers rarely live within 10 kilometers range of an economic center. Farmers living 15-19.99 kilometers away from economic centers are 80.4% to 81.3% less likely to grow tobacco compared to those who live 10-14.99 kilometers away, and farmers living more than 20 kilometers away are 56.5% to 89.1% less likely to grow. Tobacco farmers living more than 20 kilometers away are 4.2 to 18.5 times more likely to grow under contract.
Conclusions:
Farmers living further away from an economic center is less likely to grow tobacco, but if they grow tobacco, they are much more likely to grow under contract. The identification of geographic heterogeneity not only reveals the spatial economic dynamics, but also helps policy makers tailoring policies at different regional level.

T1  - Norms in Community-Based Organic Farming
AN  - 2582791318
AB  - In integrated organic farming, smallholder farmers tend to work collectively in a group with the norms that bind their behaviours. This study aims to explore norms among the farmers with the case of organic rice farming in Ketapang Village, Susukan Sub district, Semarang, Indonesia. The study employed the qualitative case study method and applied Ostrom’s Institutional Analysis and Development framework. The norms among these farmers included only planting local varieties, using natural pest repellent, jointly cultivating the land, fairness in water distribution and prioritising rice consumption for farming families rather than profiting from the sale of rice products.

TT  - Salvaging mortgage loans and land title redemption
AN  - 2534619282
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the performance of the revolving fund (RF) regarding the ability of smallholder debtors to retrieve land title deeds, and also to examine the factors influencing the outstanding debts and percentage of outstanding interest of the smallholders in the Central and Northeastern regions of Thailand.Design/methodology/approachPrimary data were collected from 430 debtors in the Central and Northeastern regions of Thailand in order to compare the differences in livelihood assets as well as their opinions on benefits derived from the operation of the RF. Secondary data were also collected from the RF administration, in order to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the fund. Heteroskedasticity-corrected ordinary least squares and Tobit regression models were employed to examine the factors influencing the outstanding debts and percentage of outstanding interest of the smallholders, respectively. Furthermore, the student’s t-test was used to examine the differences in the livelihood assets among debtors in the two regions; and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine differences in livelihood indicator scores among the three types of debtors.FindingsThe empirical results revealed that the RF is effective as the fund could provide loan to smallholders to enable them redeem their land title deeds from their previous creditors. The t-test results reveal significant differences in the livelihood assets among debtors in the two regions. One-way ANOVA indicates differences in livelihood indicator scores among the three types of debtors. The results of the heteroskedasticity-corrected ordinary least squares regression revealed that being married, low frequency of floods and less influence of third parties significantly reduced the outstanding debts. The results of the censored Tobit regression revealed that increased frequency of meeting with the RF administration, less influence of third parties, high land potential and interaction of age and experience significantly decreased the percentage of outstanding interest.Practical implicationsIt is imperative to intensify information and education regarding the regulations, payment terms and modalities to clients in order to facilitate repayments of the loans disbursed. The organization of the RF should pay particular attention to the role of the committees involved, information administration and loan repayment monitoring. The RF should increase the frequency of meetings with smallholders, minimize the influence of third parties and give priority to old and experienced smallholders who possess land with high potential for earning incomes to enable them repay the loans.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that examined the effectiveness of the RF to enable smallholders retrieve their land title deeds.

T1  - Social learning in smallholder agriculture: The struggle against systemic inequalities
AN  - 2362230214; 2018-53560-004
AB  - Purpose: Ethiopia operates a large agricultural extension service system. However, access to extension-related knowledge, technologies and agricultural inputs is unequally distributed among smallholder farmers. Social learning is widely practiced by most farmers to cope with this unequal distribution though its practices have hardly been documented in passing on knowledge of agriculture and rural development or embedding it into the local system of knowledge production, transfer and use. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to identify the different methods of social learning, as well as their contribution to the adoption and diffusion of technologies within Ethiopia’s smallholder agricultural setting. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed methods approach was used, comprising farmer and expert interviews, focus group discussions, informal individual discussions and key informant interviews. The data were documented, coded and later analyzed using SPSS and ATLAS.ti. Findings: The findings showed that 55 per cent of the farmers in the studied areas fully relied on social, community-level learning to adopt agricultural technologies, while 35 per cent of them relied on social learning only partly. Farmers acquired knowledge through social networks by means of communication, observation, collective labor groups, public meetings, socio-cultural events and group socialization. Informal institutions such as iddir, debo and dado, helped farmers learn, adopt and diffuse technologies. Originality/value: This study used the concept of epistemic oppression by Dotson (2014) as a conceptual framework to examine farmers’ access to extension services and to analyze how informal institutions serve as workplace learning for the smallholder farmers. The authors suggest community-level social learning serves as a coping mechanism against the prevailing limitations of the formal extension system, and at the same time, it guards against the deepening of social, political and epistemic inequalities that are inherent to the knowledge system.

T1  - Gender and pest management: constraints to integrated pest management uptake among smallholder coffee farmers in Uganda
AN  - 2169555055
AB  - Even though both empirical and field evidence hail integrated pest management (IPM) as promising techniques for cost-effective and environment friendly control of agricultural pests, coffee farmers still rely on pesticides. A post coffee stem borer IPM training survey of 126 farmers reveals that farmers’ attitudes toward pesticides is a major constraint to IPM use. Farmers perceived that pesticide use simplifies pest management, produces higher yields and good quality coffee appealing to the buyers. On this basis, they mainly used pesticides compared to IPM practices for Coffee Stem Borer (CSB) pest management. Second, the CSB IPM practices are less appealing because of the high labor requirements and costly nature and therefore a constraint especially to women and the elderly. Consequently, increasing IPM practices uptake requires a deliberate and collective effort of key coffee sector stakeholders to design and implement educational programs aimed at judicious application of pesticides. After that, a continuous testing of more IPM techniques coupled with encouraging farmers to adapt and make modifications on the current practices can potentially reduce pesticide use.

T1  - Cultural multi-level selection and biological market theory explain the coupled dynamics of labor exchange cooperation and social support
AN  - 213512129
AB  - Smallholders rely on labor exchange and social support networks; however, little is known about the cooperative dynamics of these interlinked systems. Whereas cultural multi-level selection (CLMS) predicts group membership and changes in the dominant level of selection modulates cooperation, biological market theory (BMT) posits market size fluctuations affect cooperation. We assess these predictions by examining two dimensions of labor exchange, competitive helping and labor reciprocity, and their downstream impacts on social support in a Dominican community between 2007 and 2010. First, we analyze within-community labor organization. Next, we analyze how international regulatory change and the 2008–2009 World Trade Collapse affected local labor organization and its impacts on competitive helping and labor reciprocity. Finally, we show how labor dynamics affected social support. Analyses reveal that (1) village labor initially involved two levels (labor contracting and labor exchange) and the presence of a structured group who maintained higher rates of reciprocal labor relative to non-group members; (2) changes in the international commodities market reduced labor contracting, the size of the labor exchange market, and the dominant level of selection, resulting in less competitive helping, lower rates of reciprocity for group members, and more cliquish social support; and (3) as the global market for bay oil ameliorated, labor organization shifted back to a pre-recession structure, resulting in a larger labor market with more competitive helping and higher rates of reciprocity amongst group members. We highlight the utility of an integrated CMLS and BMT framework for analyzing cooperative dynamics and socio-economic systems sustainability.

T1  - The Post-Privatization Role of Out-growers' Associations in Rural Capital Accumulation: Contract Farming of Sugar Cane in Kilombero, Tanzania
AN  - 1980700253
AB  - Contract farming is widely promoted by multilateral agencies as an engine of economic growth in developing countries. The agencies often stress the need for governments to create strong farmers' organizations that can shoulder the risks associated with contractual relationships with large corporations. However, empirical studies of farmers' organizations in contractual schemes are few and tend to dismiss the performances of these organizations for not measuring up to donor expectations. This paper seeks to offer a more unbiased examination of what farmer's organizations actually do by recounting the development of out-growers' associations in a contract farming scheme in central Tanzania. The paper explores the new space for social organization and business operations which emerged after privatization in 1998. It is argued that under certain conditions, out-grower associations occupy a crucial position with regard to classic agrarian questions of land, labour and capital accumulation.

T1  - How farmer videos trigger social learning to enhance innovation among smallholder rice farmers in Uganda
AN  - 1994425215
AB  - Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools such as videos promoted to enhance farmer access to information to influence change in farming practices need to be situated in social learning processes. Farmers learn and innovate through social learning characterized by exchanges amongst farmers to contextualize knowledge and adapt technologies for relevance. This study assessed how a video-mediated extension approach (VMEA) triggers social learning to enhance innovation among rice farmers in Uganda using experiences of a Non-Government Organization, Sasakawa Global 2000 (SG 2000). A cross-sectional study was conducted among 100 farmers subjected to VMEA by SC 2000 in Kamwenge district. Semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs), field observations and key informant interviews were used to collect the quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) while thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative data. Results indicate that inherently, videos trigger conversational exchange between farmers including those who do not watch the videos. These interactions enable collective reflection, evaluation and validation of knowledge, which in turn motivate experimentation. In this study, videos significantly enhanced awareness, knowledge acquisition, uptake of technologies and innovation among rice farmers. However, the potential of videos in influencing farmer knowledge and behavioral change can be further exploited if the users can produce contextualized videos of farmer practices and innovations for dissemination. Among other things, effective use of videos in extension requires excellent skills in facilitating social learning processes; and video documentation of farmer practices and innovations to aid scaling up and deepening learning.

T1  - The vulnerability and resilience of smallholder-inclusive agricultural investments in Tanzania
AN  - 1951600661
AB  - This paper compares and contrasts two cases of smallholder-inclusive agricultural investment in Tanzania and investigates the factors that shape their vulnerability and resilience to risks and uncertainties that influence their performance and viability as a development strategy. Drawing on observations and interviews with smallholders, key informants and management and staff of two large-scale rice and sugarcane estates, we discuss how the division of ownership, voice, risks and rewards in these investments affect how small- and large-scale producers negotiate their relationships in practice, highlighting the role of the state and political economy factors in shaping these dynamics. We find that a lack of transparent and reliable policies and mechanisms for governing access to land, resolving contractual disputes, and marketing the crops in question reinforces power asymmetries between the participants, undermining the potential development impacts of both investments. The two estates moreover appear to enjoy different levels of state protection that render their commercial operations more or less vulnerable and resilient to various political and economic risks. We conclude that smallholder-inclusive agro-investments in Tanzania are unlikely to fulfil both a commercial and a development function in the absence of consistent, transparent and enforceable 'rules of the game' that incentivize and reward responsible agricultural investment behaviour.

T1  - Processor Linkages and Farm Household Productivity: Evidence from Dairy Hubs in East Africa
AN  - 1949496591
AB  - Linking smallholder farmers to large enterprises could be a powerful mechanism to improve input and output markets as well as other productivity-enhancing services for liquidity constrained smallholders. Dairy hubs promoted by East African Dairy Development project are collective farmer-owned milk bulking and/or chilling plants through which farmers get access to output markets and inputs as well as other services necessary for their dairy enterprises. The hubs act as a linkage between large processors and smallholder dairy farmers. They enable farmers to supply milk to large dairy processors who are emerging key players in the East African dairy industry. In addition to the different forms of linkages with large processors, these hubs also differ in their level of growth toward sustainability. In light of this background, this work aims to provide evidence on the effects, at farm level, of different types of linkages between smallholder dairy farmers and large processors through dairy hubs. The study uses cross-sectional survey data collected from 993 smallholder livestock keeping households living within the dairy hubs' catchment areas in Kenya and Uganda. Statistical tests on technical efficiency estimates from dairy farm enterprises were conducted in order to provide evidence of the effects of the types of processor linkages on the performance of the dairy farm enterprises. The results provide evidence of no strong influence at farm levels that can be attributed to different forms of linkages with processor that dairy hubs adopt. Moreover, though hub sustainability is directly linked to the producer organization's efficiency level, our results show that it does not sufficiently translate to more productive farmers. These findings call for concerted efforts by development agents in the dairy sector, policy makers, and even large processors to intervene in order to support improved farm performance. As evident from the study, one direct policy tool at the disposal of these agents is extension messages. [EconLit citations D24; L25; Q12].

T1  - Incentives and moral hazard: plot level productivity of factory-operated and outgrower-operated sugarcane production in Ethiopia
AN  - 1935223906
AB  - We investigate the unique contractual arrangement between a large Ethiopian sugar factory and its adjacent outgrower associations. The only significant difference between the sugarcane production on the factory-operated sugarcane plantation and on the outgrower-operated plots is the remuneration system and thus, the incentives to the workers. We compare the productivity of these two production schemes using a cross-sectional plot-level data set. As sugarcane production depends on various exogenous factors that are measured as categorical variables (e.g., soil type, cane variety, etc.), we estimate the production function by a nonparametric kernel regression method that takes into account both continuous and categorical explanatory variables without assuming a functional form and without imposing restrictions on interactions between the explanatory variables. Our results show that outgrower-operated plots have--ceteris paribus--a statistically and economically significantly higher productivity than factory-operated plots, which can be explained by outgrowers having stronger incentives to put more effort into their work than the employees of the sugar factory.

T1  - The Oil Palm Complex: Smallholders, Agribusiness and the State in Indonesia and Malaysia
AN  - 1965027526
AB  - In the other, Leslie Potter curiously suggests elements of the West African and Latin American palm oil sectors that could be expanded in Southeast Asia (more mixed cropping without necessarily maximizing yield; a greater share of smaller mills, including non-industrial artisanal mills with traditional processing technology and far lower quality oil output; and an even greater role for cooperatives).

The big picture story of oil palm in Southeast Asia is that the sector's rapid growth has contributed to widespread environmental degradation while serving as a key source of economic growth in the post-Suharto era, lifting millions of rural Indonesians from extreme poverty (e.g. Byerlee, Falcon and Naylor 2017; Edwards 2016; and Euler et al. 2016).

Long-standing links between extractive and agro-industrial sectors and vested interests are well documented, so this book could have focused more on the fascinating changes that have taken place in the post-Suharto era, in particular the central role that smallholders have played in recent growth; the role that decentralization has played in enabling and shaping this growth; and the kaleidoscope of ownership and farm management regimes that emerged.

T1  - Exclusion and Counter-exclusion: The Struggle over Shrimp Farming in a Coastal Village in Bangladesh
AN  - 1915552874
AB  - This article explores the processes whereby control over land and water is exercised in the context of commercial shrimp cultivation in coastal Bangladesh. The authors draw on the insight that the exercise of control over resources implies both inclusion for some and exclusion for others, and that shifting the boundary between the two involves the deployment of four interacting 'powers of exclusion' -- regulation, the market, force and legitimation -- the effectiveness of which depends on specific historical conjunctures. The article uses a case study of a village in Khulna District to explore: (a) the processes by which poor farmers were excluded from their land by large shrimp farmers; (b) the ways in which villagers experienced the changes in land use and social relations associated with the shrimp boom; and (c) the conjunction of internal and external factors that enabled smallholders to collectively mobilize to reverse their exclusion from the land. Understanding these messy and contingent processes of exclusion and counter-exclusion helps to inform strategies aimed at securing the property rights and livelihoods of the rural poor.

T1  - Oil Palm Boom, Contract Farming, and Rural Economic Development: Village-Level Evidence from Indonesia
AN  - 1904774654
AB  - Contracts between companies and local communities have been used in Indonesia for over 20 years to involve smallholder farmers in the emerging palm oil industry. Impacts of these contracts have not been analyzed systematically. Here, data from a village survey, spanning a time period from 1992 to 2012, are used to evaluate effects on rural economic development. Panel regression models with village fixed effects show that contracts have significantly contributed to wealth accumulation. Contract signed before 1999 were more beneficial than contracts signed afterward, which is due to more public sector support and infrastructure investments during the earlier period. Contracts have contributed to decreasing inter-village inequality, not only because poorer villages were more likely to adopt a contract, but also because they benefited more from contract adoption than richer ones. The results suggest that well-designed contracts can be important for smallholder farmers to benefit from the oil palm boom. The village-level approach ha clear advantages to evaluate direct and indirect economic effects, but it also has drawbacks in terms of analyzing environmental effects and issues of intra-village inequality. More research with various approaches is needed to better understand the multifaceted implications of oil palm contracts for sustainable rural development.

T1  - Contract-farming in Staple Food Chains: The Case of Rice in Benin
AN  - 1904774489
AB  - In this paper, we analyze the impact of smallholder participation in a contract-fanning scheme in the rice sector in Benin. We use data from a cross-sectional farm-household survey and different propensity score matching estimations to reveal how participation in a contract-farming scheme affects smallholder rice production. We find that contract-farming results in expansion of the rice area, intensification of rice production, increased commercialization of rice, and higher farm-gate prices, and ultimately contributes to rice output growth and increased income. Our findings imply that contract-farming can contribute to upgrading the rice supply chain and the development of the rice sector in Benin. Promoting and supporting the spread of contract-farming schemes in the sector might be an effective way to contribute to reaching the government goals of expanding rice production to become self-sufficient and improving rice quality to compete with imported rice. While there is a large empirical literature on contract-farming in high-value and commodity export sectors, studies on contract-farming in staple food sectors are very scarce. Our results document that contract-farming for staple food crops can be sustainable and benefit smallholder farmers; which is against theoretical expectations that contracting for staple food crops is not feasible because of contract-enforcement problems that stem from a low value of produce, low storage and transport costs, and a larger number of buyers in the chain. Our study contributes to understanding the role that contract-farming might play in the much needed upgrading of domestic and staple food crop sectors in developing countries.

T1  - DYNAMICS OF FRESH PRODUCE MARKETING IN SMALL-SCALE IRRIGATION SCHEMES: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALLHOLDER FARMERS IN SOUTH AFRICA
AN  - 2298756970
AB  - Small-scale irrigation schemes provide a worthwhile livelihood for smallholder farmers, though those farmers struggle to obtain a guaranteed and consistent market for their produce. This article focuses on constraints and opportunities that different types of smallholder irrigation farmers in South Africa have in meeting requirements of fresh produce markets. It draws on findings from 94 household interviews, in-depth life histories, and in-depth interviews with stakeholders. The findings reveal that not all farmers are able to effectively market their produce, while not every smallholder is suited to the same type of market. Matching of smallholder characteristics with particular markets is thus necessary.

T1  - Which smallholders are willing to adopt Acacia mangium under long-term contracts? Evidence from a choice experiment study in Indonesia
AN  - 1938995912
AB  - Smallholder ownership of forests has grown rapidly over the last 25 years, leading to global forest transition; however, incentives are required to keep smallholders growing trees under long-term afforestation contracts. This article reports on smallholders' willingness to join afforestation programs, growing Acacia mangium under contract on their private farmland. In a Choice Experiment, we examine the effects of policy attributes of afforestation contracts, including contract duration, labour participation, timber insurance, training opportunities, road improvement, and expected income. We report the marginal value of changes in monetary terms. A scale-extended latent class model was used to analyse preference heterogeneity in data of 323 smallholders from three different regions in Indonesia (West Kalimantan, Yogyakarta, and South Sumatera). These regions are at different forest transition stages. Our results indicate that there are four latent preference classes, which value attributes of the contract differently. Individual characteristics (risk orientation, tree growing experiences, and occupation), and regional differences explain the probability of preference class membership. Our findings have important implications for enhancing afforestation strategies that improve social welfare of smallholders in various forest transition stages.

T1  - Uganda Warehousing Receipt System: Improving Market Performance and Productivity
AN  - 1917414363
AB  - Warehouse receipt systems (WRS) allow farmers and traders to access markets and financial systems. While this system is not new in Uganda, as seen by both public and private effort since 2004 during its pilot, very little is known why it failed to ensure market access and credit. With the Uganda Warehouse Receipt System Authority in place, the government of Uganda seeks to reinstate the public warehouse receipt system with a focus on the electronic WRS (E-WRS). This study therefore seeks to document perceived benefits and challenges of private sector stakeholders of the WRS in Uganda. This paper relies on qualitative data and follows the Structure-Conduct-Performance framework used to analyse agricultural commodity markets. The results reveal that while the market structure and conduct of the pilot WRS was implemented as theorized, it faced various barriers that led to poor market performance. Despite the challenges, actors are optimistic that reinstating the WRS will lead to better access to markets and credit. The paper draws important policy implications for the implementation of the WRS including the need for government to spearhead promotion of standards; improvements in smallholder productivity; capacity strengthening of collective action; and the importance of increased sensitization on all aspects of the WRS.

T1  - Social Differentiation and the Politics of Land: Sugar Cane Outgrowing in Kilombero, Tanzania
AN  - 1889751095
AB  - The privatisation of formerly state-owned sugar cane estates and mills in the late 1990s led to the reconfiguration of the ownership structure and production of the Tanzanian sugar industry. This included the decentralisation of sugar cane production operations to outgrowers and their associations. Based on an investigation of sugar cane outgrowers of the Kilombero Sugar Company, this article explores the outcomes of this transformation and the dynamics of social differentiation, and the ways in which this is shaped by Tanzania's institutional and legal framework governing the sugar industry. While increased sugar cane production has created jobs and income for some outgrower households, it has also been associated with several adverse impacts. Large-scale outgrowers have rapidly captured the most lucrative business opportunities and the land they require, marginalising smaller outgrowers. This is further exacerbated by heightened competition among farmers and patronage relations affecting the distribution of harvest quotas and cheap sugar imports. The outgrower model is central to national development initiatives such as the Southern Agriculture Growth Corridor of Tanzania and 'Big Results Now'. Despite the grand ambitions of large-scale agricultural commercialisation, who wins and who loses out depends more on the local political economy, where the sugar industry, local business, political elites and local communities compete for the benefits of expanded sugar production.

T1  - Sugar, People and Politics in Zimbabwe's Lowveld
AN  - 1889751041
AB  - The expansion of outgrower areas linked to large lowveld sugar estates has been an important component of Zimbabwe's land reform since 2000. This has involved the transfer of nearly 16,000 ha to over 800 resettlement farmers on irrigated 'A2' plots of around 20 ha each. These farmers now produce around a quarter of the sugar output linked to the Triangle and Hippo Valley mills. Tongaat Hulett, a large South African conglomerate, is the dominant shareholder in Zimbabwe's sugar industry, and its Zimbabwe operation represents a crucial part of the overall multi-million-dollar business. The new outgrowers are a mix of former civil servants, sugar industry professionals and business people, with some politicians and security service personnel also with land. Through a detailed analysis over 12 years of the changing fortunes of a group of new outgrowers linked to Hippo Valley estate, the paper explores the patterns of production, employment and wider livelihood contexts of outgrowers and their workers. In particular the paper examines the tensions and conflicts that have arisen, particularly between the new outgrowers and the estate. The paper in turn explores the implications for sugar politics in Zimbabwe's Lowveld. The new outgrowers were drawn from a range of previous occupations and, compared to land reform beneficiaries in nearby dryland smallholder areas, were richer, better educated and more well-connected politically. The paper asks how this new group negotiated a relationship with a large-scale South African capitalist enterprise, and with what outcomes. More broadly, the paper examines how outgrowers, the state and capital brokered a politically and economically acceptable post-land reform deal, suiting all parties. Based on the longitudinal case study insights, the paper concludes with an assessment of whether Zimbabwe's very particular sugar outgrower model of land reform will work, and if it does, for whom.

T1  - The Green Belt Initiative, Politics and Sugar Production in Malawi
AN  - 1889751015
AB  - This paper critically examines underlying political economy dynamics of the expansion of sugar cultivation in Malawi within the framework of the Green Belt Initiative (GBI). This is being promoted in the context of a protracted legislative impasse in land reform efforts, targeting primarily land that belongs to smallholder farmers. The paper argues that the promises of employment, technology transfer and infrastructure development, as outlined in the GBI concept paper and touted in the outgrower sugar cane project, remain rhetorical. Communities in the investment sites are experiencing a destabilisation of social relations, precipitated by persistent violent confrontations with a coalition of elites. Corporate and elite interests have coalesced to press on with the GBI experiment, even though the welfare of smallholders is being undermined, and despite the growing resistance through both legal and extra-legal means. This political economy of sugar must be understood in relation to Malawi's elite politics, a pattern that has persisted across successive regimes.

T1  - L'organisation des marchés de producteurs de fruits et légumes biologiques à Nairobi, Kenya
AN  - 2428028564
AB  - La consommation de produits certifiés n'est plus l'apanage des pays développés. Au Kenya, les premiers marchés biologiques sont apparus à Nairobi en 2006. Ils sont approvisionnés par des maraîchers, confrontés à une diversité de défis : construire une certification biologique crédible, garantir la fraîcheur des produits et composer avec l'hétérogénéité des attentes des consommateurs. À partir de données d'enquête et du cadre analytique des coûts de transaction, nous analysons l'organisation des marchés de 2006 à 2013. Nous montrons que si la certification collective des producteurs a permis de fonder les premiers marchés, son abandon progressif n'a pas été synonyme d'effondrement des transactions. En effet, l'organisation des producteurs, qui tient d'une quasi-intégration, a permis une coordination efficace avec le marché, contribuant à la formation d'une rente que les producteurs cherchent à préserver. De plus, les relations interpersonnelles entre producteurs et consommateurs, rendues possible par la vente directe, ont contribué à la continuité des transactions malgré l'arrêt de la certification et la hausse de l'incertitude associée.Alternate abstract:
Consumption of certified products is no longer the privilege of developed countries. In Kenya, the first organic markets appeared in 2006 in Nairobi. They were supplied by vegetable growers, facing different challenges: building a credible organic certification, maintaining products' freshness and dealing with the heterogeneity of consumers' expectations. Based on survey data and the transaction costs analytical framework, we analyze Kenyan organic markets between 2006 and 2013. We show that if the collective certification of producers enabled the creation of initial markets, the gradual abandonment of certification was not synonymous with the collapse of transactions. Actually, the organization of producers, which is “quasi-integrated”, allowed for an efficient coordination with markets, helping to build a rent that the producers try to protect. On the other hand, interpersonal relations between producers and consumers resulting from direct sales, ensured the continuation of transactions despite the end of the certification and the related increasing uncertainty.

T1  - Typification of the production system of snuff (Nicotiana tabacum) in the Guanenta province, Santander department, Colombia
AN  - 1999110864
AB  - In the province of Guanenta (Santander), lack of technical assistance received by producers is one of the main obstacles to the production of snuff. The objective of this research was to characterize the snuff production systems in the province, considering technical, socioeconomic and environmental variables. The sample was determined from census by producers supplied by Coltabaco, using stratified random sampling; the data were processed by multiple correspondence analysis. The results are shown as discriminant variables: type of snuff, the percentage of sharecropping, type of leaf curing, implementation of irrigation system, development of alternative crops, crops rotation and membership of producers to associations. Four types of production systems were found: i) conventional - snuff type burley, ii) technified - snuff type burley, iii) conventional alternative - snuff type burley, iv) conventional - snuff type black. Finally and aiming improve the production of snuff, this study propose improvement actions for technical assistance programs received by producers, alternatives for access improvement and availability of water.

T1  - Agricultural commercialisation models, agrarian dynamics and local development in Ghana
AN  - 1891442527; 4806474
AB  - The renewed commitment of African states to modernising agriculture has reignited longstanding debates about different models of agricultural commercialisation. Which forms of commercialisation models will reduce land dispossession and the impoverishment of smallholders, and transform smallholder agriculture and the wider economy? Of the three broad models of agriculture commercialisation in this debate - plantation, contract farming and medium-scale commercial farming - contract farming has been identified as central to the future of Africa's commercial agriculture. This paper provides empirical evidence from Ghana on the impacts of these three models on land, labour/employment, livelihoods and local economic linkages. Our findings show that the plantation and the commercial farming areas have highly commercialised land relations, land scarcity and high land prices, compared to the outgrower area where traditional systems of accessing land still dominate, enabling families to produce their own food crops while also diversifying into wage labour and other activities. Food insecurity was highest in the plantation area followed by the commercial area, but lowest in the outgrower area. Here, semi-proletarianised seasonal workers combine self-provisioning from their own farms with wages, and this results in better livelihood outcomes than for permanent workers in plantations and commercial farms. Due to the processing units in the plantation and the outgrower models, they provided more employment. However, the casualisation of labour and gender discrimination in employment and access to land occur in all three cases. All three models generated strong economic linkages mainly because they combined attributes such as processing, provided markets for nearby farmers, induced state infrastructural development and diffused technology in competitive ways. The effects of the models on household and local development are coproduced by their interaction with pre-existing conditions and wider national economic structures.

T1  - Land and agricultural commercialisation in Meru County, Kenya: evidence from three models
AN  - 1891440095; 4806473
AB  - What are the relative pros and cons of different pathways of agricultural commercialisation in Africa? This paper examines aspects of three commercial farming cases, each of which represents one of the three most dominant models of commercial agriculture - small-scale outgrowers, medium-size commercial farms and a large estate - in the high-potential area of Meru County in Kenya. The paper provides a comparative perspective across the cases, examining their outcomes in terms of land relations, labour, livelihoods and local economic linkages. The study used a mixed-methods approach, including a household survey and a range of qualitative methods including detailed life histories. We find diverse dynamics across our cases: increasing land consolidation spurred by the rising class of commercial coffee farmers, but also land fragmentation as a result of population pressure and prevalence of inheritance as a pathway to land acquisition in the case of horticultural outgrowers. The plantation generates relatively better paid employment for permanent skilled workers, while the commercial farms create employment for casualised, insecure and poorly paid seasonal labour. These labour regimes are highly gendered. The outgrowers combine family and hired labour. Across the three cases, farmers diversify income between on-farm and off-farm sources. The commercial and outgrower farms are dynamically integrated into the local economy, while the estate is less so. These features of the three models generate processes of social differentiation, which are reshaping the agrarian structure and rural economy in Meru County.

T1  - Plantations, outgrowers and commercial farming in Africa: agricultural commercialisation and implications for agrarian change
AN  - 1891439566; 4806475
AB  - Â  Whether or not investments in African agriculture can generate quality employment at scale, avoid dispossessing local people of their land, promote diversified and sustainable livelihoods, and catalyse more vibrant local economies depends on what farming model is pursued. In this Forum, we build on recent scholarship by discussing the key findings of our recent studies in Ghana, Kenya and Zambia. We examined cases of three models of agricultural commercialisation, characterised by different sets of institutional arrangements that link land, labour and capital. The three models are: plantations or estates with on-farm processing; contract farming and outgrower schemes; and medium-scale commercial farming areas. Building on core debates in the critical agrarian studies literature, we identify commercial farming areas and contract farming as producing the most local economic linkages, and plantations/estates as producing more jobs, although these are of low quality and mostly casual. We point to the gender and generational dynamics emerging in the three models, which reflect the changing demand for family and wage labour. Models of agricultural commercialisation do not always deliver what is expected of them in part because local conditions play a critical role in the unfolding outcomes for land relations, labour regimes, livelihoods and local economies.

The paper provides a comparative perspective across the cases, examining their outcomes in terms of land relations, labour, livelihoods and local economic linkages. The study used a mixed-methods approach, including a household survey and a range of qualitative methods including detailed life histories. We find diverse dynamics across our cases: increasing land consolidation spurred by the rising class of commercial coffee farmers, but also land fragmentation as a result of population pressure and prevalence of inheritance as a pathway to land acquisition in the case of horticultural outgrowers. The plantation generates relatively better paid employment for permanent skilled workers, while the commercial farms create employment for casualised, insecure and poorly paid seasonal labour. These labour regimes are highly gendered. The outgrowers combine family and hired labour. Across the three cases, farmers diversify income between on-farm and off-farm sources. The commercial and outgrower farms are dynamically integrated into the local economy, while the estate is less so. These features of the three models generate processes of social differentiation, which are reshaping the agrarian structure and rural economy in Meru County.

T1  - The impact of agricultural cooperatives membership on the wellbeing of smallholder farmers: empirical evidence from eastern Ethiopia
AN  - 1956861100
AB  - This study evaluated the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on the wellbeing of smallholder farmers using cross-sectional data collected from the eastern part of Ethiopia. Using consumption per adult equivalent as a wellbeing indicator, we measured the impact of agricultural cooperative membership by implementing propensity score matching and endogenous switching regression estimation techniques. Both estimation methods indicate that joining agricultural cooperatives has a positive impact on the wellbeing of smallholder farmers. Furthermore, the analysis also indicates that agricultural cooperative membership has a heterogeneous impact on wellbeing among its members.

T1  - Auction winning, social dynamics and non-compliance in a payment for ecosystem services scheme in Indonesia
AN  - 1939229118
AB  - Conservation auctions for payment for ecosystem services (PES) are useful to identify the levels of incentives that will cover the opportunity costs of farmers supplying ecosystem services. Although auctions are increasingly used for allocation in PES schemes, the factors that lead to their successful implementation and eventual environmental outcomes are poorly understood in developing countries. We investigated the socio-economic and institutional contexts that led to smallholders' auction winning and eventual compliance using linear mixed-effects models, and post-auction and post-contract surveys. We employed a case study of a conservation contract preceded by a sealed-bid, multiple round, uniform price auction for watershed services from coffee farmers in Lampung, Indonesia. The auction participants presented low education levels, low asset endowments and small plot sizes. The study obtained evidence that farmers with larger plot areas were more likely to win the contracts, suggesting economies of scale. Most farmers considered the auction a fair self-selection mechanism to allocate contracts where allocation was not influenced by power or social rank. Non-compliance was associated with labor availability constraints, short duration of land ownership and existence of previous conservation applications, suggesting lax of capability to invest in applying conservation agriculture. Final bids were however not good predictors of compliance, among other factors, calling into question the potential of auctions to elicit the actual incentive from the farmers. Ensuring that farmers understand the purposes of auctions for effective contract allocation beyond a mere game and identifying farmers that might encounter difficulties fulfilling the contract could increase the likelihood that such a PES scheme would be successful.

T1  - Stuck in a rut: emerging cocoa cooperatives in Peru and the factors that influence their performance
AN  - 1876812609
AB  - Agri-cooperatives play an important role in helping resource-poor farmers reach high-value markets. In addition to linking smallholders to markets, cooperatives provide their members with various services, such as extension, credit, input subsidies, and social programmes. While the literature contains many examples of success, there has been limited discussion on the often long and turbulent process by which cooperatives develop over time and the viable options for shortcuts. This study examines four emerging cocoa cooperatives in Peru to determine their overall business viability, the key factors that advanced their development, and their capacity to address the needs of their members. Our findings suggest that strategies for supporting cooperative development have largely failed to address major internal weaknesses and the challenges posed in the external environment. The cooperatives have received time-bound, uncoordinated, and often small-scale, interventions, which have focused on infrastructure expansion and technical assistance. Important areas related to business management and governance structures, trust relationships with buyers, and sufficient working capital have largely been ignored. Shortcuts may be achieved through improvements in access to business development and financial services, deeper engagement by private sector to support the development process, and commitment by stakeholders to monitoring and critical reflection for strategy refinement.

T1  - Knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) relating to brucellosis in smallholder dairy farmers in two provinces in Pakistan
AN  - 1878126608
AB  - The present study aimed to assess the extent of knowledge and understanding of brucellosis in smallholder dairy farmers and identify practices at the farm and household level that might pose a risk for humans contracting brucellosis. Between February and June 2015 a cross-sectional study was conducted among smallholder farms (n = 420) in five districts of Punjab and two districts of Sindh province. Farmers were interviewed using a questionnaire to obtain information on farmers’ knowledge about brucellosis and the potential risks for contracting the disease that are present for dairy farmers and their families. Logistic regression and ordinal logistic models were used to investigate potential predictors for risky behaviours. The results show almost all farmers (97%) were not aware of the modes of transmission of brucellosis. Relating to risk, the majority (66%) of the farmers’ families were reported to consume raw milk and its products, live in shared housing with animals (49%) and not cover hand cuts during contact with animals (74%). All farmers performed at least one risky practice on a regular basis for brucellosis transmission from animal to human. A multivariable analysis highlighted that the respondents with no formal education and those who had not heard of the disease displayed greater risky behaviour. Poor understanding of the disease, presence of multiple risky practices on farm and at the household, and incorrect perception supports the need for an educational awareness program in order to ensure uptake of improved practices.

T1  - The determinants and economic impacts of membership in coffee farmer cooperatives: recent evidence from rural Ethiopia
AN  - 1939227214
AB  - Smallholder farmers in developing countries are often encouraged to get organized into cooperatives mainly to overcome production and marketing constraints that usually hinder the improvement of their livelihoods. However, impact evaluations regarding the contribution of cooperatives are limited; evaluation results are mixed and are not conclusive. The current study contributes to the literature by examining the determinants and economic impacts of cooperative membership using household survey data gathered from coffee farmers in the Jimma Zone of Oromia, Ethiopia. A propensity score matching (PSM) and endogenous switching regression (ESR) models are used to estimate treatment effects by controlling for selection biases. The results are augmented with qualitative data collected through group discussions made with randomly selected farmers in the study area. Findings indicate that the probability of farmers' membership decision increases with age, education level, family size, social networks, land property and accessibility to cooperatives. Both PSM and ESR models show that membership is positively associated with household income and assets. The ESR estimation results further confirm that members economically perform significantly better than if they had not been members and non-members would have even performed better than members if they had joined cooperatives. The results of group discussions also verify overall direct and spill-over effects, though cooperative services to members and non-members are undifferentiated. The results indicate a need for a mechanism to enhance the participation of poorer farm households, and to further improve member benefits as potential areas in making cooperatives more meaningful, attractive and sustainable.

T1  - Livelihood options of landless households and land contracts in north-west Ethiopia
AN  - 1865259126
AB  - Agricultural land scarcity and increasing landlessness are becoming serious livelihood challenges in rural areas of highland Ethiopia. Land contracts give access to land for landless households through sharecropping and rent. The paper examines the demand for land, livelihood options of landless households, and the role of land contracts in mitigating land shortages among the rural communities. Its specific objectives are intended to examine the: (1) land demand and livelihood options of landless households and (2) role of land contracts in mitigation of land shortages and the implication of this on sustainable management of land resources. The study was conducted in Dangila district in the north-western highlands of Ethiopia. Data were gathered from a survey of 201 rural households from Apr 2011 to Oct 2012. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, and independent samples t test were used to analyse the data. Results indicate that over 14 % of the studied households were landless and demanding farmlands. Sharecropping, daily labour, selling wood and charcoal, and rearing livestock were major livelihood options and strategies practiced by landless households next to crop farming. Sharecropping contracts were found to minimize the land demand of over 95 % of the landless households. However, most of the sharecropping contracts (58 %) were managed through informal customary practices. Old age, having many dependent family members, and owning large farm plots were found to encourage the practice of the sharing-out of land. Conversely, youth, higher education level, and ownership of many livestock initiated the sharing-in of land. Shared and contracted plots were, however, observed not to have been treated with proper sustainable soil and water conservation technologies. Allocating grazing lands and accessing credit facilities were actions taken by local governments to stabilize land shortages. It is concluded that making credit accessible to landless households and promoting the development of small-scale enterprises in rural areas can help to engage the idle agricultural labour and ease the pressure on land resources. Preconditions should be set to sustainably use and manage contracted lands and shared plots and to avoid the wasteful use of agricultural lands. There should be a focus on promoting small-scale enterprises (i.e. expanding the non-farming sector) in rural areas and minimizing informal land contracts. Liberalizing the land market by lifting the land contract restrictions can enhance the exchange of land among the rural households.

T1  - Mixed policies give more options in multifunctional tropical forest landscapes
AN  - 1859424057
AB  - Summary              Tropical forest landscapes face competing demands for conserving biodiversity, sustaining ecosystem services and accommodating production systems such as forestry and agriculture. Land-sparing and land-sharing have emerged as contrasting strategies to manage trade-offs between production and biodiversity conservation. Both strategies are evident in land-management policies at local-to-international scales. However, studies rarely report the impacts of these strategies, assessed for multiple stakeholders and multiple ecosystem services, particularly in real landscapes.              Using a case study from a high-priority region for forest protection, restoration and rural development in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, we analysed the potential outcomes under 10 alternative policy scenarios, including land-sharing, land-sparing and mixed strategies. We used a novel optimization process integrating integer programming with conservation-planning software (Marxan with Zones) to identify production possibility frontiers (PPFs), highlighting the trade-off between smallholder agriculture and oil palm, subject to achievement of a set of carbon, timber and biodiversity conservation targets.              All policy scenarios modelled proved to be capable of achieving all targets simultaneously. Most strategies resulted in an expansion of the PPF from the baseline, increasing the flexibility of land allocation to achieve all targets. Mixed strategies gave the greatest flexibility to achieve targets, followed closely by land-sparing. Land-sharing only performed better than the baseline when no yield penalties were incurred, and resulted in PPF contraction otherwise. Strategies assessed required a minimum of 29-37% to be placed in conservation zones, notably protecting the majority of remaining forest, but requiring little reforestation.              Policy implications. Production possibility frontiers (PPFs) can evaluate a broad spectrum of land-use policy options. When using targets sought by multiple stakeholders within an ecosystem services framework, PPFs can characterize biophysical, socio-economic and institutional dimensions of policy trade-offs in heterogeneous landscapes. All 10 policy strategies assessed in our case study are biophysically capable of achieving all stakeholder objectives, provided at least 29-37% of the landscape is conserved for biodiversity. This novel methodological approach provides practical options for systematic analysis in complex, multifunctional landscapes, and could, when integrated within a larger planning and implementation process, inform the design of land-use policies that maximize stakeholder satisfaction and minimize conflict.

T1  - Agroecology to Promote Just Sustainability Transitions: Analysis of a Civil Society Network in the Rwenzori Region, Western Uganda
AN  - 1939763134
AB  - Agroecology is gaining ground within the debate on how to address systemic social and environmental problems in agriculture. However, it remains marginalized in agricultural research and development plans around the world. This paper analyzes agroecology as a socio-technical niche in Uganda, where its emergence in part can be seen as an unintended consequence of neoliberalist development. The case studied is a civil society network that links farmer groups and non-governmental organizations across different levels. Through the analytical lens of regime dimensions, we find that agroecology is practiced as a smallholder-centric approach that champions collective action, locally appropriate technologies, participatory methods in research and extension, and calls for more active state guidance of agricultural change along specific principles. However, two major concerns are raised; the niche converges with the dominant discourse around commercialization, and policy advocacy is hampered by the apolitical history of NGOs and an increasingly tense political climate. These two areas are critical for agroecology to contribute to just sustainability transitions, and civil society organizations with strong links to smallholder farmers need to be included in the growing scholarly debate both to inform it and to receive guidance from it. Transition frameworks can help facilitate the development of viable institutional designs and explicitly transformative strategies, but we also point towards the need for engagement with theories on civil society collective action and political mobilization.

T1  - Building resilience to food insecurity in rural communities: Evidence from traditional institutions in Zimbabwe
AN  - 1919467307
AB  - Many rural communities that depend on smallholder farming face food insecurity induced by climate-related disasters. In response, some communities are taking the initiative to cope and adapt to climate-related disasters. Using case study material from the Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe, this article examines how traditional institutions are enhancing resilience to food insecurity in rural areas. The data were collected through interviews and focus groups involving traditional leaders, ward councillors, village civil protection members and villagers selected in the valley. The findings point to how the Zunde raMambo informal safety net, nhimbe form of collective work and the practice of share-rearing arrangement to access draught power help save lives and alleviate food insecurity induced by flood or drought disasters. The study concludes that the three schemes are evidence of community reorganisation or change in response to food insecurity. They are a form of absorptive capacities enabling the community to cope with food insecurity.

T1  - Do Private Sustainability Standards Contribute to Income Growth and Poverty Alleviation? A Comparison of Different Coffee Certification Schemes in Ethiopia
AN  - 1878411308
AB  - Private sustainability standards are increasingly important in food trade with developing countries, but the implications for smallholder farmers are still poorly understood. We analyze the implications of different coffee certification schemes in Ethiopia using cross-sectional survey data, and regression and propensity-score-matching techniques. We find that: Rainforest Alliance (RA) and double Fairtrade-Organic (FT-Org) certifications are associated with higher incomes and reduced poverty, mainly because of higher prices; Fairtrade (FT) certification hardly affects welfare; and Organic (Org) certification reduces incomes, chiefly due to lower yields. Cooperative heterogeneity importantly shapes these results. Results imply that private standards may not always deliver what they promise to consumers.

T1  - Class dynamics in contract farming: the case of tobacco production in Mozambique
AN  - 1816866510; 4757288
AB  - This paper examines the class relations emerging in a contract farming scheme in Mozambique. Debates in the literature about contract farming characterise this market arrangement as leading to farmers losing control over production at the hands of capital. By discussing both the drivers and impacts of changes in the division of property and labour, this paper reveals a complex class structure in which the pressure of merchant capital on farmers is internalized within households and transferred onto workers and sharecroppers. This challenges the pertinence of conventional policy that prescribes empowering contract farmers without considering their varied class positions and interests.

T1  - Second-order cybernetic analysis to re-construct farmers’ rationale when regulating milk production
AN  - 1771466361; 2016-11491-001
AB  - This paper presents an activity and knowledge analysis using second-order cybernetics for analysing human activities in social-ecological systems. We do this with the case of smallholder farmers producing milk in Nakuru County, Kenya. The analysis is based on farmers′ actions and the knowledge behind their actions. Using this approach, we analysed how smallholder farmers regulate milk production and how they influence milk quality. Farmers influence milk quality with their routine and problem-solving management actions. The knowledge behind these actions can be represented as rules. We found that 
Routine Control Rules that influence milk quality aim to (i) minimize contamination (ii) maintain udder health, and (iii) preserve milk. 
Problem-Solving Control Rules aim to deal with disturbances associated with (i) market imperfection (ii) microbiological contamination (iii) disease, and (iv) unfavourable milk composition. The approach revealed key restrictions and disturbance factors influencing milk quality in smallholder dairy systems. It also allowed for co-identification of best practices and entry points for contextualized innovations, i.e. innovations that fit into the respective production context. The co-analysis led to changes in farmers’ practices, as it fostered the co-development of milk quality standards to be applied at the community level as preparation for collective marketing activities. When emphasis is placed on finding restrictions and developing innovations, the approach can be further applied to other land-use systems. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Échapper au piège « qualité–exclusion » dans les indications géographiques : réflexions sur le cas du poivre de Penja
AN  - 2427586645
AB  - La protection des indications géographiques (IG) est considérée dans les pays en développement comme une façon de valoriser les produits d’origine et de renforcer les systèmes agroalimentaires localisés en améliorant l’accès au marché des petits producteurs. La démarche d’enregistrement des IG va au-delà de la lutte contre les usurpations des noms géographiques et peut contribuer à modifier le fonctionnement de la filière. En effet, l’enregistrement suppose l’accord des producteurs sur un cahier des charges qui définit les caractéristiques-clés du produit et du processus de production et délimite la zone de production. Cependant, les effets positifs de la protection sont souvent menacés, en particulier dans les pays du Sud, par ce que nous appelons le « piège qualité–exclusion » : la recherche d’une meilleure qualité du produit peut provoquer l’exclusion des producteurs les plus faibles ; à l’inverse, éviter toute exclusion peut conduire à un cahier des charges trop vague ou un système de contrôle trop laxiste, ce qui rendra l’IG inefficace. Nous analysons comment ce dilemme peut être géré pour améliorer l’accès des petits producteurs au marché en examinant le cas du poivre de Penja (Cameroun), enregistré en 2013 et devenu la première IG protégée dans la zone de l’Organisation africaine de la propriété intellectuelle (OAPI). Nos résultats montrent que pour garder tant l’équité que l’efficacité de la protection des IG, il est nécessaire d’accompagner la protection juridique par des actions et des politiques appropriées. Les aspects critiques sont l’élaboration d’un cahier des charges et d’un système de contrôle rigoureux, mais aussi capables de minimiser les règles difficiles à atteindre, et la fourniture de services capables de favoriser l’accès aux IG des producteurs les plus faibles.Alternate abstract:
The protection of geographical indications (GI) is considered in developing countries as a powerful tool for supporting origin products and for strengthening local agrifood production systems by improving farmers’ market access. GI protection may have several effects that go far beyond the fight against misuses of the geographical name and can stimulate a new organisation and functioning of the supply chain. Indeed, the GI protection requires an agreement of producers on a Code of practices that specifies the production area, the process and product characteristics, and on an appropriate control system. However, GI protection positive effects are often threatened, especially in the context of Southern countries, by what we call “quality–exclusion trap”. In fact, searching for a better product qualification can cause the exclusion of less empowered producers. On the contrary, when the Code of practices and the control systems are too flexible, the GI scheme may be inefficient. The paper aims to analyse how the GI quality–exclusion trap could be managed in order to improve market access for small producers. Empirical evidences come from the case of Penja pepper (Cameroon) that obtained the registration as GI in 2013 thus becoming the first protected GI in the African Intellectual Property Organization area. Results highlight that in order to involve less empowered actors and to guarantee equity and efficiency of the GI protection, a set of accompanying actions and policies is required. Crucial issues concern how to fill the gap between the current practices and the rules of the Code of practices, the choices about the control system, and the provision of some public goods and services allowing the weakest actors to benefit of the protected GI as well.

T1  - Oil Palm Expansion among Smallholder Farmers in Sumatra, Indonesia
AN  - 1813021089
AB  - Many tropical regions are experiencing a rapid growth of oil palm cultivation. In Indonesia, the world's leading palm oil producer, in addition to large companies, smallholder farmers are increasingly engaged in the oil palm sector. Smallholder oil palm cultivation may contribute to income gains and socio-economic development. However, land-use decisions by smallholders are not well understood. Without appropriate policies, negative social and environmental consequences can also occur. To improve the knowledge base, we use data about present and past land-use decisions from a survey of farm households in Sumatra. Employing duration models, we analyse the determinants and dynamics of oil palm adoption among smallholders. We find that independently operating farmers are currently driving growth rates in the oil palm sector. Smallholder adoption decisions are mainly attributable to regional and village level factors. While the current adoption primarily occurs outside of contracts, previous contractual ties between companies and other farmers in the same village play an important role for individual decisions. Beyond initial adoption, we also analyse later expansion decisions. While expanding the oil palm area subsequent to initial adoption is common among all types of adopters, those without previous contracts are found to expand significantly faster. We conclude that the concessions the government has allocated to palm oil companies in the past have initiated oil palm adoption in the small farm sector, but that the ensuing land-use dynamics are mostly beyond government control. Some wider implications are discussed.

T1  - Collective action as a way to develop Organic Farming in Armenia
AN  - 1854374686
AB  - Armenia is a landlocked country which gained its independence about 24 years ago. A big portion of population (44.2%) is still involved in agriculture and mostly consists of smallholder farmers. More than 20% of Armenia's GDP comes from agriculture. The government considers organic agriculture as a priority area in the country's agro-food policy as well as part of sustainable development. However, organic farming is still on its early stages of development just like in other Eastern European, Caucasian and Central Asian countries. Yet, the country already has an organic certification body which is recognized both in the US and the EU, organic supermarket in the capital city and a growing demand for organic products. 

              
Those smallholder farmers and especially the organic producers face difficulties accessing markets, gathering necessary information, meeting quality control and food safety requirements, certifying their production as organic or fair trade, accessing credits and so on. Researchers believe that smallholder agriculture can play an important role in reducing global poverty as a vast number of world's poor are rural households that are involved in agriculture. Armenian smallholders are no exception and they face most of the same challenges and problems that peasants from other parts of the world do. This paper studies one of the ways that these challenges can be overcome, that is, collective action which has proved to be successful in many cases.

              
Although collective action can be very useful and helpful for smallholder farmers and there is even a small successful example from the organic sector in Armenia, it is not a panacea. Organizing a collective action is not an easy task and its success depends on many factors such as small group size, clearly defined boundaries, shared norms, past successful experiences and others.

T1  - Explaining the performance of contract farming in Ghana: The role of self-efficacy and social capital
AN  - 1806430430
AB  - Self-efficacy is the belief of an individual to have the ability to be successful in a given domain. Social capital is the economic value of a person's relationships. In the context of this study, self-efficacy is the belief of a farmer to be able to improve her income with contract farming, which increases her actual ability. Social capital increases the ability of the farmers through social support. We surveyed 400 smallholder pineapple farmers and find that both self-efficacy and social capital are decisive for their successful integration into contract farming. To identify causal effects, we use two instruments, which are also of interest on their own: the historical presence of (1) cocoa cooperatives and (2) Christian missionary schools. During Ghana's colonial period, the British established cocoa cooperatives, which differed in their performance as a function of biogeographic factors and thus persistently shaped the self-efficacy of the farmers. Roughly at the same time, Christian missionaries established missionary schools, which impacted the traditional societies so that social capital decreased. The finding that self-efficacy and social capital are still shaped by historic variables could indicate that these variables are only slowly changing, or that they only do so in the absence of policy intervention. The latter raises the possibility that effective policies could benefit from strong reinforcing feedbacks once self-efficacy and social capital improve.

T1  - Reasons for Acceptance of Improved Potato Varieties by Smallholder Producers
AN  - 1805784598
AB  - It may be that improved cultivars can increase yield. This project was undertaken to determine factors affecting adoption of new potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) cultivars over those currently in use. A logistic regression procedure was used to examine factors influencing adoption of improved potato varieties by smallholder farmers. Data were collected with questionnaires administered to 158 respondents. The logit model initially contained 13 factors, of which seven had significant effects on adoption of improved potato varieties. The estimated chi-square value (χ2 = 31.91) indicated that the data fit the model reasonably well. Partial effects analysis indicated that, compared to those who do not use fertilizer, those who do are younger; have more extension contacts and access to credit, and likely plan to allocate more land to growing potato. Those who belong to an agricultural cooperative are more likely to adopt improved potato varieties. Social, economic, and institutional factors have implications for stakeholders who might adopt or extend use of improved potato varieties.

T1  - Member checking: A feminist participatory analysis of the use of preliminary results pamphlets in cross-cultural, cross-language research
AN  - 1795490941; 2016-25418-006
AB  - Participation and reflexivity have become buzzwords that are seldom discussed in terms of their practical employment. Against this backdrop, with a specific focus on geography, this article presents and analyzes the advantages and limitations of a methodological tool that seeks to enhance both reflexivity and participation. The tool was a pamphlet written in local languages that contained several pictures and summarized the data gathered in previous fieldwork sessions. This tool was used in a four-year research project on the gender division of labor in smallholder irrigation farming in Kenya and Tanzania. The pamphlet showed participants their contributions to the research process and offered them the opportunity to correct, improve and further discuss previously collected data. It not only ensured research validity but also allowed for a shift in the research power hierarchy. Finally, the pamphlet effectively created a space for inclusion, discussion and reciprocal learning, leading to collective reflexivity and catalytic validity by empowering participants and re-orienting the researcher.

T1  - Determinants of participation and intensity of participation in collective action: evidence from smallholder avocado farmers in Kenya
AN  - 1846736947
AB  - Access to markets is one important strategy which can assist smallholder farmers to move out of poverty. Collective action through farmers' groups has been identified as a strategy to improve the participation of farmers in markets. This study analyzes the determinants of participation and intensity of participation of collective action in production and marketing of avocado in Kenya. Group participation and the intensity were modelled as a binary choice decision and analyzed using logit models. Interviews were conducted with 301 farmers in avocado production zones in Kenya. The result showed that age, education, gender and perceptions on knowledge and improved technology influence farmers' decision to participate in group activities. Occupation, area of residence and farmers' perception on knowledge and improved technology use, and economic benefits had a significant influence on the intensity of participation. We conclude that it is crucial to educate farmers through trainings, workshops and seminars before group formation in order to ensure that they understand the importance and impacts of collective action. Finally, development practitioners and government organizations which intend to intervene through farmers' groups should understand farmers' perceptions and hence expectations from the groups.

T1  - Bird Responses to Lowland Rainforest Conversion in Sumatran Smallholder Landscapes, Indonesia
AN  - 1791321609
AB  - Rapid land-use change in the tropics causes dramatic losses in biodiversity and associated functions. In Sumatra, Indonesia, lowland rainforest has mainly been transformed by smallholders into oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) monocultures, interspersed with jungle rubber (rubber agroforests) and a few forest remnants. In two regions of the Jambi province, we conducted point counts in 32 plots of four different land-use types (lowland rainforest, jungle rubber, rubber plantation and oil palm plantation) as well as in 16 nearby homegardens, representing a small-scale, traditional agricultural system. We analysed total bird abundance and bird abundance in feeding guilds, as well as species richness per point count visit, per plot, and per land-use system, to unveil the conservation importance and functional responses of birds in the different land-use types. In total, we identified 71 species from 24 families. Across the different land-use types, abundance did not significantly differ, but both species richness per visit and per plot were reduced in plantations. Feeding guild abundances between land-use types were variable, but homegardens were dominated by omnivores and granivores, and frugivorous birds were absent from monoculture rubber and oil palm. Jungle rubber played an important role in harbouring forest bird species and frugivores. Homegardens turned out to be of minor importance for conserving birds due to their low sizes, although collectively, they are used by many bird species. Changes in functional composition with land-use conversion may affect important ecosystem functions such as biological pest control, pollination, and seed dispersal. In conclusion, maintaining forest cover, including degraded forest and jungle rubber, is of utmost importance to the conservation of functional and taxonomic bird diversity.

T1  - Market structure and coherence of international cooperation: the case of the dairy sector in Malawi
AN  - 1781223570
AB  - A supply chain in disarray can be identified as a barrier not only to growth for the agricultural sector but also to achieving food security in a country because it may lead to either a deficiency in food production and/or too high prices. Using the dairy sector of Malawi as an example, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the coherence between market structure and the development strategy pursued by international donors. Within Malawi the dairy sector may be characterised as a segmented market: with both formal and informal milk markets, with smallholder producers serving both markets. The formal market includes few processing firms operating with idle capacity and selling dairy products to an affluent segment of the urban population, whilst the informal market comprises the sale of unprocessed milk products to the less affluent urban population and also rural areas. In this context, cooperative international action, conducted through agencies from a range of countries, is targeted at improving the efficiency of the formal supply chain and also the creation of local supply chains that sell processed products directly to poor consumers. The paper discusses reasons why these two cooperation strategies, given the structure of the sector, may potentially conflict with each other, the need to address the degree of market imperfection of the formal sector and the desirability of ex-ante coordination of plans amongst donors.

T1  - Cooperative membership and dairy performance among smallholders in Ethiopia
AN  - 1780142601; 4743278
AB  - This study assesses the impact of cooperative membership among dairy producers in Selale, Ethiopia. We selected ten impact indicators: proportion of dairy income to total household income, total dairy income, proportion of crossbreed cows to the total number of cows in the herd (indicator of technological innovation), amount of feed bought (another indicator of technological innovation), milk production, milk productivity, commercialization, price per liter of milk, price per kg of butter and the share of milk production that is processed at the household level. In order to minimize the biases that may arise by simply comparing members and non-members, we employed a propensity score matching technique. The empirical analysis shows that cooperatives are strong in facilitating technological transformations and commercialization but weak in offering better prices. These findings suggest structural trade-offs between different domains of cooperatives' action. Overall, our study concludes that cooperatives can be efficient business institutions to foster rural development and food security. All rights reserved, Elsevier

T1  - Household level spillover effects from biofuels: Evidence from castor in Ethiopia
AN  - 1780142533; 4743269
AB  - The indirect effects of biofuels are mostly considered negative. In this paper, we argue that there may be a positive indirect effect of biofuels on food security and poverty. Using micro-level evidence and a matched plot pair design through which we control for plot and farmer characteristics, we show that the introduction of castor production for biofuel in a poor country as Ethiopia can significantly improve food productivity of rural households who produce raw material for biofuel production. This spillover seems particularly linked to enhanced access to inputs and technical assistance which were provided as part of biofuel feedstock production contracts. Our results thus document another mechanism through which biofuels may influence smallholders' food security, a mechanism that did not receive attention so far. All rights reserved, Elsevier

T1  - Smallholder Farmers' Resilience under the Rural-ecological Crisis (2016): Case Studies from West Java, Indonesia
AN  - 2765097659
AB  - Recent studies on the resilience of rural farmers in developing regions revealed a close connection between vulnerability, adapted livelihood mechanisms/strategies, and livelihood resilience. Resilience is reflected by the smallholder farmers’ capacity for survival. This paper tries to understand the nexus between the ecological vulnerability of a rural agricultural community suffering from detrimental effects of climate variability and farmers’ ways of adapting to the changing environment. Drawn from empirical research carried out in several ecologically critical agricultural regions of Indonesia, the study notes several adaptive livelihood mechanisms that reflect the way rural people withstand crises. By adapting to crises, these people constructively build resilience. Three adaptive mechanisms that increase livelihood resilience are economic adaptive mechanisms, ecological adaptive mechanisms, and social adaptive mechanisms. Farmers adopt a set of strategies to survive such as crop diversification, utilizing available natural resources, selling assets, asking for help, borrowing money, and creating and using social-network-based collective action to guarantee social security. The study used qualitative and quantitative methodologies to gain data and information. The study proposes that livelihood resilience develops as a response to ecological vulnerability. The authors conclude that rural livelihood resilience is the result of a set of continual adaptations that smallholder farmers employ to respond to crises and vulnerabilities.

T1  - Organisational health and performance: an empirical assessment of smallholder producer organisations in Africa
AN  - 1829531946
AB  - We use recent data from 253 smallholder producer organisations (SPOs) in Ethiopia, Malawi and Senegal, factor and regression analysis to define organisational health, understand its determinants and relate health to performance. We find that latent health evolves according to a life cycle and that start up incentives and design rules are important determinants of an organisation's progression through this life cycle. Health, in turn, is found to explain SPO performance measured in terms of profits. Healthier and more profitable SPOs are those with an economic justification at establishment, those initially pursuing defensive objectives and those SPOs that have put in place a strategy for capital formation. More educated presidents contribute to the health of an SPO but it is also shown that when the president of the SPO is female, profits are lower while the organisation is not healthier.

T1  - Challenges and Strategies for Improving the Agricultural Marketing Environment in Developing Countries: Evidence From Ghana
AN  - 1776687207
AB  - Millions of smallholder farmers in developing countries face incredible challenges marketing their farm produce. This article isolates lack of market information, collusion among middlemen, and thus price determination, and lack of transportation facilities as the main challenges facing smallholders in many developing regions. The findings also show the emergence of spontaneous farmer marketing associations involved in price setting and determination. This offers a valuable opportunity for stakeholder support in strengthening these informal institutions and in integrating them into formal agricultural marketing and contracting.

T1  - Large-scale Agro-Industrial Investments and Rural Poverty: Evidence from Sugarcane in Malawi
AN  - 1735026105
AB  - This article investigates the potential household welfare implications of large-scale agro-industry investments in Sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, it compares the income and poverty of households integrated into a Malawian sugar investment with those households not integrated. Two different supply-chain set-ups are studied: smallholder outgrower and vertically integrated estate-production systems. Potential selection bias is addressed using propensity score matching and a number of robustness checks. We find significant positive income differences between participants in either supply-chain set-up and the respective counterfactual. Overall, income poverty is significantly lower among outgrowers relative to the counterfactual, whereas in the case of estate workers these differences are only significant for the extreme poverty line. Qualitative interviews confirm these results, but they also allude to risks for the rural poor associated with social conflicts in the expansion of new outgrower schemes as well as a lack of transparency in the operation of existing schemes, which are likely to undermine the poverty-reducing potentials of such investments.

T1  - Trust, transaction costs, and contract enforcement: evidence from apple farmers in China
AN  - 2081646307
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of trust and transaction costs on farmers’ contract enforcement choices using cross-sectional data collected from apple farmers in China. Design/methodology/approach – This study employs ordered probit model in a two-stage regression procedure to conduct the empirical analysis. Findings – The empirical results show that trust and transactions costs significantly influence smallholders’ contract enforcement choices. In particular, longer distance to collective place and delayed payment have negative and significant impacts on contract enforcement, while farmers’ cognition trust has a positive and significant impact on contract enforcement. Factors such as education, distance to main road and price premium also tend to have positive and statistically significant impacts on contract enforcement choices. Originality/value – This study used first-hand survey data to examine the impact of transaction costs and trust using proxy variables on apple farmers’ contract enforcement choices.

T1  - SOCIAL LIMITATIONS OF MAIZE FARMERS' ADAPTATION TO NEOLIBERAL POLICY REFORM IN MEXICO
AN  - 1792174037
AB  - This article highlights the interfaces between micro-level livelihoods, social networks, and macroeconomic trends and policies. Specifically, it analyzes the role of farmer groups in livelihood adaptation of smallholder maize producers in southern Mexico. We show how neoliberal market changes have shaped the local social structure with constraining and enabling effects on households' ability to adapt, while in turn the outcomes of the neoliberal policy reforms are being (re)shaped by the responses of the farmers, thereby changing the structural context. We provide evidence for the heterogeneity of adaptation processes and show that farmers' participation influences the outcomes of neoliberal policy reforms.

T1  - Addressing food and nutrition insecurity in the Caribbean through domestic smallholder farming system innovation

AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue on Food security in the context of climate change and bioenergy production in Tanzania: methods, tools and applications (pp.1163/1292) / Special Issue on Environmental change and food security: the special case of Small Island developing states (pp.1293/1394)

              
 Smallholder farmers are key actors in addressing the food and nutrition insecurity challenges facing the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), while also minimizing the ecological footprint of food production systems. However, fostering innovation in the region's smallholder farming systems will require more decentralized, adaptive, and heterogeneous institutional structures and approaches than presently exist. In this paper, we review the conditions that have been undermining sustainable food and nutrition security in the Caribbean, focusing on issues of history, economy, and innovation. Building on this discussion, we then argue for a different approach to agricultural development in the Small Island Developing States of the CARICOM that draws primarily on socioecological resilience and agricultural innovation systems frameworks. Research needs are subsequently identified, including the need to better understand how social capital can facilitate adaptive capacity in diverse smallholder farming contexts; how formal and informal institutions interact in domestic agriculture and food systems to affect collaboration, co-learning, and collective action; how social actors might better play bridging and linking roles that can support mutual learning, collaboration, and reciprocal knowledge flows; and the reasons underlying past innovation failures and successes to facilitate organizational learning.

T1  - Factors affecting the innovation potential of smallholder farmers in the Caribbean Community
AN  - 1712460558
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue on Food security in the context of climate change and bioenergy production in Tanzania: methods, tools and applications (pp.1163/1292) / Special Issue on Environmental change and food security: the special case of Small Island developing states (pp.1293/1394)

              
 The need for domestic smallholder farming systems to better support food and nutrition security in the Caribbean is a pressing challenge. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) faces complex socio-ecological challenges related to historical legacies of plantation agriculture, small population sizes, geographic isolation, jurisdictional diversity, and proneness to natural disasters, all of which underscore the importance of fostering system-wide innovation potential. This paper explores the factors that are impacting the innovation potential of smallholder farming households in four CARICOM small island developing states (St. Lucia, St. Kitts-Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana) using data collected through producer household surveys, focus groups, and key informant interviews. Results indicate that a systemic lack of access to finance, markets, and knowledge networks is perceived as limiting smallholder innovation potential in the region. Compounding these challenges was a pervasive lack of trust reported between actors and institutions throughout the agricultural innovation system, hindering the potential for collective action. Our findings point to the need for more decentralized governance approaches that are capable of establishing stronger relationships between actors and institutions to enhance knowledge flows in support of regional rural development and food and nutrition security objectives.

T1  - Can improved agricultural water use efficiency save India’s groundwater?
AN  - 2549710956
AB  - Irrigated agriculture is placing increasing pressure on finite freshwater resources, especially in developing countries, where water extraction is often unregulated, un-priced and even subsidized. To shift agriculture to a more sustainable use of water without harming the food security and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of smallholders, substantial improvements of water use efficiency will be required. Here, we use detailed hydroclimatic and agricultural data to estimate the potential for the widespread adoption of efficient irrigation technologies to halt the depletion of India’s groundwater resources. Even though we find substantial technical potential for reversing water table declines, we show that the impacts are highly sensitive to assumptions about farmers’ water use decisions. For example, we find that widespread adoption of proven technologies that include drip and sprinkler irrigation has the potential to reduce the amount of excessive extraction of groundwater by two thirds. However, under more realistic assumptions about farmers’ irrigation choices, half of these reductions are lost due to the expansion of irrigated area. Our results suggest that without the introduction of incentives for conservation, much of the potential impact of technology adoption on aquifers may be lost. The analysis provides quantitative input to the debate of incentive versus technology based water policies.

T1  - Social construction of the environment and smallholder farmers' participation in 'low-carbon', agro-industrial crop production contracts in the Philippines
AN  - 1704342290; 4697492
AB  - Several studies have suggested that socio-economic factors and production site characteristics are primary determinants of farmers' participation in 'low-carbon', agro-industrial (biofuels and oil palm) production contracts. In the Philippines, many smallholder farmers have expressed their intent to participate in intensive production of biofuel crops and oil palm with state and private organizations; others have resisted or remained indifferent. This study looks into smallholders' social construction of the environment and how this may influence their decisions to participate in such production contracts. The study is based on a survey of 462 respondents in eight communities in the province of Palawan. Using regression analysis, it illustrates how smallholders' sense of place and environmental worldviews, together with demographic and socio-economic variables, play significant roles in their decisions to enter into new biofuels (jatropha) and oil palm production contracts. Environmental worldviews are significant when there are strong negative perceptions attached to a particular crop production contract, as in the case of oil palm. All rights reserved, Elsevier

T1  - The human dimensions of water saving irrigation: lessons learned from Chinese smallholder farmers
AN  - 1668226835
AB  - Water saving irrigation (WSI) is promoted as a strategy to mitigate future water stresses by the Chinese government and irrigation scientists. However, the dissemination of WSI in China has been slow and little is understood with respect to why farmers adopt WSI or how WSI interacts with the social and institutional contexts in which it is embedded. By analyzing qualitative data from 37 semi-structured and 56 unstructured interviews across 13 villages in northwest China, this paper examines smallholder farmers' knowledge and perceptions of WSI, and how WSI interacts with farmer livelihood decision-making and extant systems of land and water management. The results show that smallholders' willingness to adopt and continuously use WSI was dampened by: 1. a lack of communal capital and measures for conflict resolution, 2. a disconnect between the temporal demands of practicing WSI and the ways farmers prioritize different livelihood strategies, 3. misconceptions about WSI systems and how they work, 4. market risks, and 5. landownership structure and economies of scale. These results suggest that programs for promoting WSI must be holistic in nature and address smallholders' day-to-day problems. Understanding why WSI did not succeed in some places will help formulate policy interventions that avoid reproducing conflicts, risks, and technological malfunctions responsible for previous failure.

T1  - Local gender contract and adaptive capacity in smallholder irrigation farming: a case study from the Kenyan drylands
AN  - 1675997345
AB  - This article presents the local gender contract of a smallholder irrigation farming community in Sibou, Kenya. Women's role in subsistence farming in Africa has mostly been analyzed through the lens of gender division of labor. In addition to this, we used the concept of 'local gender contract' to analyze cultural and material preconditions shaping gender-specific tasks in agricultural production, and consequently, men's and women's different strategies for adapting to climate variability. We show that the introduction of cash crops, as a trigger for negotiating women's and men's roles in the agricultural production, results in a process of gender contract renegotiation, and that families engaged in cash cropping are in the process of shifting from a 'local resource contract' to a 'household income contract.' Based on our analysis, we argue that a transformation of the local gender contract will have a direct impact on the community's adaptive capacity climate variability. It is, therefore, important to take the negotiation of local gender contracts into account in assessments of farming communities' adaptive capacity.

El rol de las mujeres en la agricultura de subsistencia en África ha sido mayormente analizado con una óptica de la división generizada del trabajo. Además de esto, utilizamos el concepto de 'contrato de género local' para analizar las precondiciones culturales y materiales que dan forma a las tareas específicas de cada género en la producción agrícola, y consecuentemente, las diferentes estrategias de hombres y mujeres para adaptarse a la variabilidad del clima. Mostramos que la introducción de cultivos comerciales, como disparador para la negociación de los roles de las mujeres y los hombres en la producción agrícola, resulta en un proceso de renegociación del contrato de género, y que las familias que participan del cultivo comercial se encuentran en el proceso de cambio de un 'contrato local de recursos' a un 'contrato de ingresos del hogar'. Basado en nuestro análisis, sostenemos que una transformación del contrato local de género tendrá un impacto directo en la capacidad adaptativa de la comunidad a la variabilidad del clima. Es por lo tanto importante tener en cuenta a los contratos de género locales al evaluar la capacidad adaptativa de las comunidades agricultoras. //ABSTRACT IN CHINESE: 小农灌溉农业中的&# 22312;地性别契约与调适 & #33021;& #21147; ：肯尼亚旱地的案&#2036 3 ;&#31350 ;&#2641 2;文呈现肯尼亚希普&#65 2 88;Sibou &#65289 ;中的一个小农灌溉&#208 9 2;&#1999 4;&#235 67;区的在地性别契约&#1 2 290;&#22 899;&#2 4615;在非洲口粮耕种中& # 30340;&# 35282;& #33394;，多半透过性别&#21171 ; 动 &#20998 ;工的视角检视之。&#385 0 0;&#2749 2;&#200 43;外，我们运用'在地&# 2 4615;&#2 1 035;契约'的概念，分析& # 24418;&# 2 2609;农业生产中特定性& # 21035;&# 24037;& #20316;的文化与物质先&#20915 ; 条 &#20214 ;，及其所导致的男&#246 1 5;&#1998 2;&#228 99;性调试气候变异的&#1 9 981;&#21 516;&#3 1574;略。我们将显示，& # 32463;&# 27982;& #20316;物的引进，做为&#21327 ; 商 &#22899 ;性与男性在农业生&#201 3 5;&#2001 3;&#303 40;角色之触媒，导致&#2 4 615;&#21 035;&#2 2865;约的再协商过程，& # 20174;&# 20107;& #32463;济作物耕作的家&#24237 ; ， &#21017 ;正在经历从'在地资&#28 3 04;&#228 6 5;约'转向'家户收入契&# 3 242 2;'的过程。根据我们&#3 0 340;&#20 9 98;析，我们主张，在&#2 2 320;&#24 615;&#2 1035;契约的转变，将直& # 25509;&# 24433;& #21709;小区对气候变异&#30340 ; 调 &#36866 ;能力。因此，在评&#202 7 2;&#2089 2;&#199 94;社群的调适能力时&#6 5 292;&#32 771;&#3 7327;在地性别契约的协& # 21830;&# 26159;& #33267;关重要的。 Reprinted by permission of Carfax Publishing, Taylor & Francis Ltd.

T1  - Food sovereignty, food security and fair trade: the case of an influential Nicaraguan smallholder cooperative
AN  - 1681284600
AB  - The relationships among trade, food sovereignty and food security are underexplored. I conducted qualitative research with an influential cooperative to identify lessons that food sovereignty (FS) scholars could learn from fair trade and food security, and explore linkages among these projects. First, most co-op leaders and farmers view these projects as complementary, not contradictory. Second, state-led agrarian reforms and co-ops increase access to land, markets, water, forests and pasture, which have reduced -- but not eliminated -- seasonal hunger. Third, these diversified fair trade coffee-exporting smallholders could be part of a FS agenda. However, the split in fair trade suggests that only specific versions of fair trade are compatible with FS. Fourth, capable cooperatives can enhance fair trade and FS goals, and food security outcomes. Fifth, organised smallholders resisting the fair trade split could learn from the FS social movement's strategies. Food insecurity remains a persistent challenge to both approaches.

T1  - Reflexive Consumer Markets as Opportunities for New Peasant Farmers in Mexico and France: Constructing Food Sovereignty Through Alternative Food Networks
AN  - 1656339219
AB  - Alternate food networks (AFN) in Mexico and France are seen as an anti-systemic, post-capitalist social behavior and a form of anticommodity production. We report on two local market initiatives in Mexico, comparing similar institutions in southern France. Despite the adverse situation facing peasant agriculture, consumers and producers -- urban and rural -- are mobilizing to vindicate the ethical, agroecological, and cultural dimensions of food and support the smallholder family economy, seeking more direct, face-to-face relationships. The participation of women in AFN is definitive, as consumers, producers, and processors, and as organizers and promoters as well. AFN are one dimension of a process of the "Return of the Peasants," that is, ideological spaces where farmers and consumers collectively are redefining the values of the agro-food system.

T1  - Third-Party Intervention in Terminating Oil Palm Plantation Conflicts in Indonesia: A Structural Analysis
AN  - 1728662395; 201533564
AB  - Academic literature emphasizes the importance of agents in conflict resolution analysis and neglects the influence of structure. A study of the resolution of conflict between the people of Pangean Village, Riau Province, and an oil palm plantation company shows that structure contributes to the resolution process and to the outcome of conflict. The conflict in question concerned a plot of land cultivated by PT Citra Riau Sarana (PT CRS) as part of its oil palm plantation and by smallholders linked to the company. The local district government tried but was unable to end the conflict. With the involvement of an NGO, the people of Pangean Village and PT CRS succeeded in reaching consensus, in implementing written agreements and in resolving their conflict.

T1  - Plant Variety Protection Regime in Relation to Relevant International Obligations: Implications for Smallholder Farmers in Kenya
AN  - 1718059611; 2011-839506
AB  - Together with other laws affecting agriculture, Kenya's plant varieties protection legislation was radically amended in 2012. The amendments were mainly driven by the quest to comply with international obligations, principally the 1991 UPOV Convention. However, the country is also a contracting party to other international treaties affecting seeds such as the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture and the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Moreover, the national Constitution obligates statutory recognition and protection of the ownership of indigenous seeds and plant varieties, their genetic and diverse characteristics, and their use by the communities of Kenya. The obligations deriving from all these international agreements must be fulfilled against a backdrop of farming systems that are predominantly smallholder farmer-based. This article discusses how the amendments in the new Kenya plant variety protection law depart from the former legal regime and analyzes whether the current regime is compliant with international obligations, and the implications for smallholder farmers. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Challenges and opportunities for agro-pastoral livestock smallholders in Mali
AN  - 1680172308; 4671681
AB  - This paper reports on an in-depth assessment of smallholder livestock production in rainfed agro-pastoral communities of Mali through an analysis of data from 36 case studies. Approximately 1,108 farmers were involved, with two-thirds of the case studies focusing on ruminant production and the remainder dealing with cooperative capacity building. Feeding and forage-related needs were the most frequently assessed in the case studies involving smallholders raising small ruminants or cattle, whereas organization-related needs were the most frequently assessed in those involving smallholder livestock cooperatives. Meeting the feed and forage requirements of small ruminants and cattle is the most urgent need for livestock smallholders, but addressing this challenge will be difficult without concurrent control of the breeding season and common diseases as well as implementation of appropriate methods to track and cull unproductive animals. Empowerment of grass-roots organizations, particularly women's cooperatives, through literacy programmes and effective extension outreach could have significant impacts on the improvement of smallholder livestock enterprises.

T1  - Communitarian cooperative organic rice farming in Hongdong District, South Korea
AN  - 1738476915; 201538710
AB  - It is often questioned whether sustainable agriculture by smallholder farmers can phase out conventional agriculture. This paper draws on a case study of organic rice farming in Hongdong District, South Korea, and provides insights into communitarian cooperative organic farming, a collective organic farming model. Various organic farming practices (e.g. integrated rice-duck farming) have been collectively adopted by small-scale rice farmers in Hongdong since 1994. Organic rice farming in Hongdong is characterised by place-based cooperatives, community-supported agriculture, and strong community leadership. Hongdong has demonstrated that communitarianism and smallholder cooperatives can work for each other complementarily and therefore that communitarian organic farming through smallholder cooperatives is highly operational. The Hongdong organic farming model is of great relevance to other parts of rice-growing Asia, which are dominated by smallholding farmers, in terms of the twin goals of food security and food safety.

T1  - Communitarian cooperative organic rice farming in Hongdong District, south korea
AN  - 1680172431; 4670592
AB  - It is often questioned whether sustainable agriculture by smallholder farmers can phase out conventional agriculture. This paper draws on a case study of organic rice farming in Hongdong District, South Korea, and provides insights into communitarian cooperative organic farming, a collective organic farming model. Various organic farming practices (e.g. integrated rice-duck farming) have been collectively adopted by small-scale rice farmers in Hongdong since 1994. Organic rice farming in Hongdong is characterised by place-based cooperatives, community-supported agriculture, and strong community leadership. Hongdong has demonstrated that communitarianism and smallholder cooperatives can work for each other complementarily and therefore that communitarian organic farming through smallholder cooperatives is highly operational. The Hongdong organic farming model is of great relevance to other parts of rice-growing Asia, which are dominated by smallholding farmers, in terms of the twin goals of food security and food safety.

T1  - Technological change and its impact on tenancy relation in West Bengal
AN  - 1667326017
AB  - An attempt has been made to examine the changes in tenurial contracts in consequential to the changes in agricultural production technology in Cooch Behar district of West Bengal where a dramatic change in agricultural production scenario has been witnessed over last one and half decade. The study has been made with the help of primary data collected by suitably designed schedule and questionnaire. A trend of surrendering land by the bargadars in exchange of getting ownership for a part of land thereof and thereby possibility of increasing earning as owner operator after getting ownership in foreseeable future has been elicited as a prime factor for the long sustenance of lease cultivation. From the entire analysis it comes out that with the advancement of technology, the bargaining position of the landowners vis-à-vis tenants in land lease market has been gradually favorable to the landowners and the security of tenure ensuring of getting ownership for a part of leased-in land and thereby possibility of increasing income by the tenants seems to be a compromising settlement between tenants and landowners.

T1  - Farm, household, and farmer characteristics associated with changes in management practices and technology adoption among dairy smallholders
AN  - 1648243460
AB  - This study explored whether technology adoption and changes in management practices were associated with farm structure, household, and farmer characteristics and to identify processes that may foster productivity and sustainability of small-scale dairy farming in the central highlands of Mexico. Factor analysis of survey data from 44 smallholders identified three factors--related to farm size, farmer's engagement, and household structure--that explained 70 % of cumulative variance. The subsequent hierarchical cluster analysis yielded three clusters. Cluster 1 included the most senior farmers with fewest years of education but greatest years of experience. Cluster 2 included farmers who reported access to extension, cooperative services, and more management changes. Cluster 2 obtained 25 and 35 % more milk than farmers in clusters 1 and 3, respectively. Cluster 3 included the youngest farmers, with most years of education and greatest availability of family labor. Access to a network and membership in a community of peers appeared as important contributors to success. Smallholders gravitated towards easy to implement technologies that have immediate benefits. Nonusers of high investment technologies found them unaffordable because of cost, insufficient farm size, and lack of knowledge or reliable electricity. Multivariate analysis may be a useful tool in planning extension activities and organizing channels of communication to effectively target farmers with varying needs, constraints, and motivations for change and in identifying farmers who may exemplify models of change for others who manage farms that are structurally similar but performing at a lower level.

T1  - Large-scale Agro-Industrial Investments and Rural Poverty: Evidence from Sugarcane in Malawi
AN  - 1758938472; 4723357
AB  - This article investigates the potential household welfare implications of large-scale agro-industry investments in Sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, it compares the income and poverty of households integrated into a Malawian sugar investment with those households not integrated. Two different supply-chain set-ups are studied: smallholder outgrower and vertically integrated estate-production systems. Potential selection bias is addressed using propensity score matching and a number of robustness checks. We find significant positive income differences between participants in either supply-chain set-up and the respective counterfactual. Overall, income poverty is significantly lower among outgrowers relative to the counterfactual, whereas in the case of estate workers these differences are only significant for the extreme poverty line. Qualitative interviews confirm these results, but they also allude to risks for the rural poor associated with social conflicts in the expansion of new outgrower schemes as well as a lack of transparency in the operation of existing schemes, which are likely to undermine the poverty-reducing potentials of such investments.

T1  - Market Or Hybrid? Determinants Of Agribusiness Actors' Decision Behaviour In The Agrifood Supply Chain
AN  - 1709452213
AB  - Market, hybrid or hierarchy has been in place and widely used by agribusiness firms to acquire farm products and these coordination mechanisms help smallholders to link to the global food chain. With the transaction cost economics framework, however, this paper analyses the determinants for agribusiness firms' choice of market or hybrids to acquire farm produce in the local food supply chain context. This paper aims at examining the key drivers for choosing contract or spot market mechanisms by agribusinesses in Northern Ethiopia. Structured questionnaires were administered to 247 traders in 10 towns of Tigray. Once conducting the Chow test, the pooled data was considered for the probit model and the results of the empirical model has indicated that product characteristics (quality adulteration and perishability), market information and firm characteristics were significantly driving agribusinesses to contract base transactions. Besides, the desire to postpone payments (credit based payment) appears to be a determinant factor for agribusinesses contract engagement. Based on the findings of the study, improving the capacity of dairy farmers and agribusinesses, strengthening of quality assurance mechanisms, collective action of farmers to consolidate supply, information providing institutions, and financing mechanism/credit facilities are recommended as interventions to improve the integration of agribusinesses and smallholders in the study area.

T1  - Reverse-share-tenancy and agricultural efficiency: farm-level evidence from Ethiopia
AN  - 1646696127; 4636767
AB  - Using a unique tenant-landlord matched dataset from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, we are able to show how the tenants' strategic response to the varying economic and tenure-security status of the landlords helps explain sharecroppers' productivity differentials. The study reveals that sharecroppers' yields are significantly lower on plots leased from landlords who are non-kin and landlords with weaker economic and tenure-security status (such as female) than on plots leased from landlords with the contrasting characteristics. While, on aggregate, the results show no significant efficiency loss on kin-operated sharecropped plots, more decomposed analyses indicate strong evidence of Marshallian inefficiency on kin-operated plots leased from landlords with weaker bargaining power and higher tenure insecurity. This study thus shows how failure to control for the heterogeneity of landowners' characteristics can explain the lack of clarity in the existing empirical literature on the extent of moral hazard problems in sharecropping contracts.

T1  - Silenced voices, vital arguments: smallholder farmers in the Mexican GM maize controversy
AN  - 1620537622
AB  - Smallholder producers are the collective most likely to be affected by the introduction of GMOs globally, yet the least included in public debates and consultation about the development, implementation or regulation of this agricultural biotechnology. Why are the voices and arguments of smallholder farmers being excluded from national and international GM debates and regulation? In this article, we identify barriers which prevent smallholder farmers in Mexico from having a voice in public political, economic, scientific and social fori regarding the GM maize controversy. Through the analysis of empirical data from a case study in Mexico, we identify political, institutional, economic and ontological reasons that lie behind that exclusion. We conclude with an appraisal of smallholder farmers' perspectives on GM maize and their visions of Mexico's rural future, within which they demand a meaningful and rightful space.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A Discrete Choice Analysis Of Smallholder Farmers' Preferences And Willingness To Pay For Weather Derivatives: Evidence From Ethiopia
AN  - 1655564788
AB  - The ability of Ethiopian farmers to deal with rainfall risk is scanty due to the extension of land plots and incomplete and inefficient financial markets. Traditional drought insurance is flawed by information asymmetries, high administrative costs, and non-diversifiable risks. Insurance based on indexes is a promising alternative. Working on 120 rural households, we estimate the willingness to pay for a drought weather derivative through a mixed logit model allowing for random preferences. The results suggest that the premium, indemnity, and perceived frequency of drought are important determinants of the take-up. Apparent inconsistencies in behavior can be interpreted as rational choices.

T1  - Food Management Strategies for Coping with Food Insecurity in a Changing and Variable Climate by Smallholder Farmers in Kenya
AN  - 1630818402
AB  - This study investigated the smallholder farmers' perceptions on climate change, food access and consumption across seasons, and food management strategies for coping with food insecurity, with the aim of identifying the promising cases that can be up-scaled to enhance food security. Selected were the five sites of Kenya's major agro-ecological systems. Participatory workshops and focus group discussions for 30 smallholder farmers were held in each site. The participants' collective views showed that frequent droughts, shift in the rainfall season, and unpredictable rainfall pattern were climate change indicators common to all sites. Foods widely accessible and consumed were maize, beans, sorghum, and cowpeas, with the former two being increasingly consumed due to their adaptability to various climatic conditions, relatively high yield and comparably cheap. In a favorable season, excess food is an added value, preserved and stored for an adverse season, in which food is rationed in order to carry the family through for a longer period.

T1  - Smallholder cooperatives and agricultural performance in Rwanda: do organizational differences matter?
AN  - 1610950535
AB  - Agricultural policies in Rwanda focus on agricultural intensification and increased market orientation of the smallholder farm sector. Cooperatives are seen as key vehicles in this, but little is known about their effectiveness to achieve these goals. In this article, we analyze the impact of cooperative membership on the agricultural performance of rural households in Rwanda. We use cross-sectional survey data, collected in 2012, to analyze the impact of cooperative membership on different agricultural performance indicators, including indicators on agricultural intensification, market orientation, farm revenue, and income. We use several econometric techniques to deal with potential selection bias in estimating the impact of cooperative membership, including a proxy variable method based on a willingness to pay measure and propensity score matching methods. We find that cooperative membership in general has a positive impact on farm performance but these effects are driven by specific types of cooperatives.

T1  - Social roots of resource use routes in rural Maranhao, Brazil
AN  - 1738477005; 201538689
AB  - The examination of social and ecological trajectories in two smallholder communities that experienced land conflicts in the 1980s provides empirical evidences for the formulation of a grounded political ecology of peasant resource use in Brazil's Mid-North. The approach is used to progressively track factors triggering different decisions, livelihood strategies and contrasting social relations. Today's discrepancies in land-use trajectories and social life were traced back to attitudes and the agency of local residents as they confronted socio-structural and ecological opportunities and constraints in the past. The cases reflected the contrast between a background of hierarchical, subordinated relations, and a more egalitarian social structure. Cooperation and agreement or discord and individual orientation resulted from social dynamics that marked the communities since land occupation in the 1920s. Kinship networks featured in one case enhanced collective action and welfare, while the lack of institutions regulating resource-use in the other case failed to establish a sustainable system.

T1  - Breeding programmes for smallholder sheep farming systems: II. Optimization of cooperative village breeding schemes
AN  - 1562091015
AB  - Summary

              
A simulation study was conducted to optimize a cooperative village-based sheep breeding scheme for Menz sheep of Ethiopia. Genetic gains and profits were estimated under nine levels of farmers' participation and three scenarios of controlled breeding achieved in the breeding programme, as well as under three cooperative flock sizes, ewe to ram mating ratios and durations of ram use for breeding. Under fully controlled breeding, that is, when there is no gene flow between participating (P) and non-participating (NP) flocks, profits ranged from Birr 36.9 at 90% of participation to Birr 21.3 at 10% of participation. However, genetic progress was not affected adversely. When there was gene flow from the NP to P flocks, profits declined from Birr 28.6 to Birr -3.7 as participation declined from 90 to 10%. Under the two-way gene flow model (i.e. when P and NP flocks are herded mixed in communal grazing areas), NP flocks benefited from the genetic gain achieved in the P flocks, but the benefits declined sharply when participation declined beyond 60%. Our results indicate that a cooperative breeding group can be established with as low as 600 breeding ewes mated at a ratio of 45 ewes to one ram, and the rams being used for breeding for a period of two years. This study showed that farmer cooperation is crucial to effect genetic improvement under smallholder low-input sheep farming systems.

T1  - Breeding programs for smallholder sheep farming systems: I. Evaluation of alternative designs of breeding schemes
AN  - 1562090979
AB  - Summary

              
Village- and central nucleus-based schemes were simulated and evaluated for their relative bio-economic efficiencies, using Ethiopia's Menz sheep as example. The schemes were: village-based 2-tier (Scheme-1) and 1-tier (Scheme-2) cooperative village breeding schemes, dispersed village-based nuclei scheme (Scheme-3), conventional 2-tier central nucleus-based scheme (Scheme-4), and schemes linking a central nucleus and village multiplier nuclei with selection in central nucleus (Scheme-5) or in both central and village nuclei (Scheme-6). Among village-based schemes, Scheme-1 gave the highest genetic progress, while Scheme-2 was economically the most efficient with genetic gain in the breeding objective of Birr 5.6 and a profit of Birr 37.2/ewe/year. The central nucleus schemes were more efficient than the village schemes. Scheme-4 was the most efficient with genetic gain in the breeding objective of Birr 13.5 and a profit of Birr 71.2, but is operationally more difficult as it requires a very large central nucleus. The choice between village and central nucleus-based schemes would depend on local conditions (availability of infrastructure, logistics and technical knowhow and support). Linking central nucleus with village-based nuclei (Scheme-6) would be a feasible option to overcome the operational difficulties of the conventional central nucleus scheme. If a village-based breeding program is envisaged as should be the 1st step in most low-input systems, then Scheme-2 is the most efficient. To scale out to an entire Menz breed level, Scheme-3 would be recommended.

T1  - The impact of intensive farming on land tenure: Evidence from Confucius' manors (1759-1901)
AN  - 1650530063; 2011-732816
AB  - During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, fixed-rent tenancy gradually replaced sharecropping as the dominant form of land tenancy in China. This paper hypothesizes that the secular shift in land tenure was an adaptation to the change in land utilization system towards more intensive cropping. To test the hypothesis we exploit a dataset gathered from the rent collection archives of Confucius' Lineage in the Qing Dynasty. We estimate the effect of the adoption of wheat-soybean double cropping on the choice of tenancy contract, share contract versus fixed-rent contract. We find that double cropped plots were 23.7% more likely to be managed under fixed-rent contracts than annually cropped plots. Our findings are consistent with the implications of the factor endowment theory. The adoption of double cropping made farming more complex and placed greater demands on managerial inputs of tenants. In the absence of a factor market for managerial ability, optimal tenancy contract had adapted to provide tenants with a greater incentive to supply managerial inputs than had been the case in sharecropping arrangements.

T1  - Time-Related Characteristics of Tenancy Contracts and Investment in Soil Conservation Practices
AN  - 1552561025
AB  - We present a dynamic model that shows how different types of land tenancy contracts and their time-related characteristics influence farmers' decisions to invest in soil improvement and productive inputs. Using recent household and plot-level data from the Brong-Ahafo Region in Ghana, we analyze the impact of land tenancy arrangements, contract duration, as well as the number of times the contract has been renewed in the past on the intensity of investment in soil conservation measures such as ditches and farmyard manure and productive inputs like chemical fertilizer. The empirical findings generally confirm the predictions of the theoretical model and reveal that the intensity of investments on different plots cultivated by a given farmer varies significantly with the type of tenancy arrangement on the plot as well as the time-related characteristics of the contract.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Efficiency of selection for body weight in a cooperative village breeding program of Menz sheep under smallholder farming system
AN  - 1545879738
AB  - We evaluated the efficiency of selection for body weight in a cooperative village breeding program for Menz sheep of Ethiopia under smallholder farming system. The design of the program involved organizing villagers in a cooperative breeding group to implement selective breeding of their sheep. The program was jump-started through a one-time provision of elite rams from a central nucleus flock, but subsequent replacement rams were selected from within the village flocks. We also evaluated body weight trends in a village where cooperative breeding was not implemented and individual farmers managed their flocks under traditional breeding practices. Under traditional breeding practices, genetic progress over 8 years either stagnated or declined in all the weights recorded. In the cooperative villages, selection differentials of 2.44 and 2.45 kg were achieved in 2010 and 2011 selection seasons, respectively. Birth weight, 3-month weight and 6-month weight increased, respectively, by 0.49, 2.29 and 2.46 kg in the third-generation lambs over the base generation. Improved rams supplied from the central nucleus flock gave an initial genetic lift of 14.4% in the 6-month weight. This was higher than the gain achieved from selection in the village flocks, which was 5.2%. Our results showed that village-based genetic improvement in body weights under smallholder conditions could be feasible if appropriate designs are adopted and that commencing with elite central nucleus rams help jump-start village-based programs.

AB  - We study the effect of alleviating the information asymmetry regarding product quality that is widespread in contracts between agricultural producers and buyers in developing countries. Opportunistic buyers may underreport quality levels to farmers to reduce the price that they have to pay. In response, farmers may curb investment, thereby negatively affecting farm productivity. In an experiment, we entitle randomly selected smallholder dairy farmers in Vietnam, who are contracted by a large company, to independently verify milk testing results.

T1  - The role of input vouchers in modernizing the fresh fruit and vegetable market in Turkey
AN  - 1543258519
AB  - Contractual arrangements between farmers and traders aiming at providing input/credit in return for output selling have been widely studied in the literature on agricultural economics. Nonetheless, there is one issue, which is barely mentioned in the literature: how to enforce the contract terms when traders offer credit in cash rather than input advances? This article aims to describe an innovation in farming contracts, used by fresh fruit and vegetable wholesalers in Turkey, which involves a kind of private voucher system. Drawing on original data collected from wholesalers--a segment in the supply chain hardly covered in the literature--we investigate the factors determining contract adoption using a two-limit Tobit model. Our results suggest that this private voucher system contributes to supply chain coordination and facilitates smallholder farmer participation in export and supermarket channels, which are growing rapidly in this developing country.

T1  - IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES ON SMALLHOLDERS' TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY: EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM ETHIOPIA: ANNALES DE L'ECONOMIE COLLECTIVE
AN  - 1733631795
AB  - Using household survey data from Ethiopia, this paper evaluates the impact of agricultural cooperatives on smallholders' technical efficiency. We used propensity score matching to compare the average difference in technical efficiency between cooperative member farmers and similar independent farmers. The results show that agricultural cooperatives are effective in providing support services that significantly contribute to members' technical efficiency. These results are found to be insensitive to hidden bias and consistent with the idea that agricultural cooperatives enhance members' efficiency by easing access to productive inputs and facilitating extension linkages. According to the findings, increased participation in agricultural cooperatives should further enhance efficiency gains among smallholder farmers.              Bedeutung von Agrargenossenschaften fur die technische Effizienz von Kleinbauern: Empirischer Befund aus Äthiopien              Unter Verwendung von Haushaltserhebungsdaten aus Äthiopien wird in diesem Beitrag die Wirkung von Agrargenossenschaften auf die technische Effizienz von Kleinbauern evaluiert. Wir wenden das Propensity-Score-Matching-Verfahren an, um die durchschnittliche Differenz der technischen Effizienz zwischen Bauern, die Mitglied in einer Genossenschaft sind, und unabhängigen Kleinbauern zu vergleichen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Agrargenossenschaften effektiv sind bezuglich der Bereitstellung von Unterstutzungsdiensten, die signifikant zur technischen Effizienz der Mitglieder beitragen. Es lässt sich feststellen, dass diese Ergebnisse resistent gegenuber versteckten Verzerrungen sind und konform gehen mit der Vorstellung, dass Agrargenossenschaften die Effizienz der Mitglieder steigern, indem sie den Zugang zu produktiven Inputs erleichtern und der Geschäftserweiterung dienliche Verbindungen ermöglichen. Diesen Ergebnissen zufolge sollte eine stärkere Beteiligung an Agrargenossenschaften die Effizienzgewinne von Kleinbauern weiter steigern.              Impacto de las cooperativas agrícolas sobre la eficacia técnica de las pequeñas explotaciones: análisis empírico en Etiopía              A partir de los datos obtenidos de encuestas a los hogares en Etiopía, este artículo evalúa el impacto de las cooperativas agrícolas sobre la eficacia técnica de las pequeñas explotaciones. Los autores utilizan el método denominado propensity score matching para comparar la diferencia media de eficacia técnica entre los miembros de las cooperativas agrícolas y los agricultores independientes. Los resultados muestran que las cooperativas agrícolas son eficaces para proveer servicios de apoyo que contribuyen significativamente a la eficacia técnica de sus miembros. Estos resultados son insensibles a los sesgos existentes y confirman la idea de que las cooperativas agrícolas incrementan la eficacia de sus miembros facilitándoles el acceso a los inputs productivos y a contactos comerciales. Los resultados ponen de manifiesto que intensificar la participación en las cooperativas agrícolas acrecientan las ganancias de eficacia en los pequeños agricultores.              Impact des coopératives agricoles sur l'efficacité technique des petits exploitants: Analyse empirique en Ethiopie              A partir de données d'enquêtes de ménages en Ethiopie, cet article évalue l'impact des coopératives agricoles sur l'efficacité technique des petits exploitants. Les auteurs utilisent la méthode dite propensity score matching pour comparer la différence moyenne d'efficacité technique entre membres de coopératives agricoles et fermiers indépendants. Les résultats montrent que les coopératives agricoles sont efficaces pour fournir des services de support qui contribuent significativement à l'efficacité technique de leurs membres. Ces résultats sont insensibles à des biais cachés et confirment l'idée que les coopératives agricoles augmentent l'efficacité des membres en facilitant l'accès à des inputs productifs et les liaisons à distance. Les résultats indiquent qu'intensifier la participation dans les coopératives agricoles accroitrait les gains d'efficacité des petits agriculteurs.

T1  - Evidence of Demand for Index Insurance: Experimental Games and Commercial Transactions in Ethiopia
AN  - 1551000788; 201429399
AB  - We present results of experimental games with smallholder farmers in Tigray, Ethiopia, in 2010, in which participants in the games allocated money across risk management options. One of the options was index insurance that was the same as commercial products sold locally. Participants exhibited clear preferences for insurance contracts with higher frequency payouts and for insurance over other risk management options, including high interest savings. The preference for higher frequency payouts is mirrored in commercial sales of the product, with commercial purchasers paying substantially higher premiums than the minimal, low frequency option available. This combined evidence challenges claims that the very poor universally choose minimal index insurance coverage and supports concerns that demand may outpace supply of responsible insurance products.

T1  - Evidence of Demand for Index Insurance: Experimental Games and Commercial Transactions in Ethiopia
AN  - 1532702233
AB  - We present results of experimental games with smallholder farmers in Tigray, Ethiopia, in 2010, in which participants in the games allocated money across risk management options. One of the options was index insurance that was the same as commercial products sold locally. Participants exhibited clear preferences for insurance contracts with higher frequency payouts and for insurance over other risk management options, including high interest savings. The preference for higher frequency payouts is mirrored in commercial sales of the product, with commercial purchasers paying substantially higher premiums than the minimal, low frequency option available. This combined evidence challenges claims that the very poor universally choose minimal index insurance coverage and supports concerns that demand may outpace supply of responsible insurance products.

T1  - Relative Preferences for Soil Conservation Incentives among Smallholder Farmers: Evidence from Malawi
AN  - 1761476965; 4727892
AB  - This paper uses framed choice experiments to examine the preferences of smallholder farmers in Malawi regarding alternative policy-based incentives to adopt conservation practices that reduce soil erosion and increase yields. The policy incentives offered in the choice experiments included an ideal index-based crop insurance contract, an index insurance contract with basis risk, cash payments, and fertilizer subsidies. Prior to implementing the choice experiments, the farmers participated in a workshop utilizing small group-based dynamic learning games that demonstrated how index-based crop insurance contracts function. The choice experiment results indicate that most farmers preferred cash payments to index insurance contracts, even when the insurance contracts offered substantially higher expected returns. Further, more risk averse farmers were more likely to prefer cash payments than less risk averse and risk loving farmers.

T1  - REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE WITH PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP IN THE IRRIGATION SUBSECTOR
AN  - 1526361901
AB  - Over the last few years, the number of initiatives of public-private partnerships in irrigation has increased significantly. PPPs have been developed to accelerate irrigation expansion, improve operation & maintenance services, and eliminate or reduce O&M subsidies. This paper shares the lessons learned from the experiences of the 'pioneer' countries, reviewing: (i) recent PPP transactions under implementation (Morocco, Peru and Ethiopia) and (ii) some transactions under preparation (Brazil, Morocco and Ethiopia).              The main lessons learned to date for the promotion and development of PPPs in irrigation cover the following areas:              an analysis of what constitutes a favourable environment to promote and develop a PPP, considering the potentially conflicting objectives of farmers, public and private sectors. This paper illustrates that the PPP model (with financial contribution of a private party to the CAPEX, capital investment) is more appropriate for new and modern irrigation schemes with solid irrigation services demand from commercial farmers, while other designs of private sector involvement, like management contracts, should be considered when conditions are different (smallholders with subsistence agriculture, etc.);              a description of good and bad practices for transaction design to reduce demand and payment risk and to increase attractiveness of the operation;              a discussion on the intrinsic role of PPP in irrigation, advising not to consider it as a new 'panacea' but rather as an additional tool to be used cautiously and only when some specific conditions are met. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.              RÉSUMÉ              Durant les dernières années, le nombre d'initiatives de Partenariat Public-Privé en irrigation n'a cessé de croître. Ces PPP ont été développés soit pour accélérer l'expansion des zones équipées pour l'irrigation, soit pour améliorer les services d'exploitation et de maintenance, ou encore pour éliminer ou réduire les subventions d'exploitation. Cette publication vise à partager les enseignements acquis dans les pays pionniers à partir ; (i) des projets PPP en cours de mise en oeuvre (Maroc, Pérou, Ethiopie), et, (ii) des transactions en préparation (Brésil, Maroc et Ethiopie).              Les principaux enseignements à ce jour concernant la promotion et le développement de PPPs en irrigation s'articulent autour des points suivants:              la détermination des conditions favorables tenant compte des objectifs parfois opposés des irrigants, des secteurs public et privé. Cette publication conclut que le modèle de PPP (avec participation du privé aux investissements) est généralement plus approprié pour les périmètres neufs et modernes, avec une demande solide et solvable pour des services d'irrigation, alors que d'autres modèles impliquant le secteur privé, comme les contrats de gestion, semblent plus adaptés quand les conditions sont moins favorables (agriculture familiale de subsistance, etc.);              la description des bonnes et moins bonnes pratiques pour la préparation de la transaction de manière à réduire les risques de demande et de paiement et pour consolider l'attractivité de la transaction pour le secteur privé;              La discussion sur le rôle intrinsèque des PPPs en irrigation, conseillant de ne pas les considérer comme la panacée mais plutôt comme un instrument supplémentaire de promotion de l'irrigation, à utiliser avec prudence et à bon escient.

T1  - Farmers as dispossessed citizens: the remaking of the tobacco market in Adiyaman
AN  - 1525911519; 4562206
AB  - ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: La loi turque sur le tabac de 2002 a introduit un système contractuel selon lequel les producteurs vendent leur tabac à un prix et en quantités déterminés avant la saison de la plantation. Ce nouveau système a eu un impact considérable sur la structure de la production agricole dans le sud-est de la Turquie où existe un système de métayage extensif. En se fondant sur une enquête de terrain à Adimayan, cet article étudie la façon dont ce nouveau système a transformé la structure économique et sociale de la région en offrant de nouvelles opportunités à certains, mais en les fermant à d'autres.    // ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: The Turkish tobacco law enacted in 2002 introduced a contract farming system under which growers sell their tobacco at a pre determined price and quantity to buyers before the planting season. This new system has had an immense impact on the structure of agricultural production in south-eastern Turkey, where an extensive sharecropping system exists. Drawing from my fieldwork in Adiyaman, this paper discusses the ways in which the contract farming system has transformed the social and economic structure in the region through generating new opportunities for some groups, while marginalizing others.

T1  - Interactions between Carbon Sequestration and Shade Tree Diversity in a Smallholder Coffee Cooperative in El Salvador
AN  - 1508244870
AB  - Agroforestry systems have substantial potential to conserve native biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. In particular, agroforestry systems have the potential to conserve native tree diversity and sequester carbon for climate change mitigation. However, little research has been conducted on the temporal stability of species diversity and aboveground carbon stocks in these systems or the relation between species diversity and aboveground carbon sequestration. We measured changes in shade-tree diversity and shade-tree carbon stocks in 14 plots of a 35-ha coffee cooperative over 9 years and analyzed relations between species diversity and carbon sequestration. Carbon sequestration was positively correlated with initial species richness of shade trees. Species diversity of shade trees did not change significantly over the study period, but carbon stocks increased due to tree growth. Our results show a potential for carbon sequestration and long-term biodiversity conservation in smallholder coffee agroforestry systems and illustrate the opportunity for synergies between biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.

T1  - Production level, feed conversion efficiency, and nitrogen use efficiency of dairy production systems in China
AN  - 1506426651; 24510199
AB  - A study was conducted in China to evaluate the feed conversion efficiency, nitrogen use efficiency, and the amount of human-edible grains fed under different dairy systems. Three dairy systems were defined and studied: (i) smallholder subsistence farms (SH), (ii) peri-urban farms (PR), and iii) cooperative farms (CO). The PR system had the highest milk yield, better feed conversion efficiency, better nitrogen use efficiency, and used lower proportion of grains in the diet. Within a system, different farms had wide variations in feed conversion efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency, suggesting the need to improve management practices within the system. Among the three systems, SH and CO systems require the most improvements in the management practices.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Social economy of quality food
AN  - 1507770287
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to examine the implications of the efforts to promote a quality-oriented economy that incorporates a vision of environmental sustainability and equitable social development. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis builds on a case study of food procurement in Brazil, which intended to improve the quality of food used in public schools. The case study follows ways that the promotion of quality food has localised the procurement operation, connecting smallholders to citizen-consumers. Findings - The efforts to promote quality food procurement worked to shape reflexive governance in a decentralised political environment and create an institutional device based on cooperative civic participation and state engagement. However, this process highlighted socioeconomic inequality within the country due to uneven local capacities to connect good-quality services to the citizens' everyday places. The study identifies the following paths to tackle this unevenness: improvement of place-based infrastructure; promotion of trans-local cooperation; and building on the existing informal institutional arrangements. Originality/value - The focus on quality and sustainability in general has been blind to the inequality in local capacities to define and promote the quality-oriented economy in the first place. Recognising inequality through a case study, the paper outlines specific ways for the author to link quality to trans-local equality.

AB  - Purpose -- This paper aims to examine the implications of the efforts to promote a quality-oriented economy that incorporates a vision of environmental sustainability and equitable social development. Design/methodology/approach -- The analysis builds on a case study of food procurement in Brazil, which intended to improve the quality of food used in public schools. The case study follows ways that the promotion of quality food has localised the procurement operation, connecting smallholders to citizen-consumers. Findings -- The efforts to promote quality food procurement worked to shape reflexive governance in a decentralised political environment and create an institutional device based on cooperative civic participation and state engagement. However, this process highlighted socioeconomic inequality within the country due to uneven local capacities to connect good-quality services to the citizens' everyday places. The study identifies the following paths to tackle this unevenness: improvement of place-based infrastructure; promotion of trans-local cooperation; and building on the existing informal institutional arrangements. Originality/value -- The focus on quality and sustainability in general has been blind to the inequality in local capacities to define and promote the quality-oriented economy in the first place. Recognising inequality through a case study, the paper outlines specific ways for the author to link quality to trans-local equality. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Impact of metal silos on households' maize storage, storage losses and food security: An application of a propensity score matching
AN  - 1541994446; 2011-661991
AB  - Maize is the most important food staple in Eastern and Southern Africa, with a highly seasonal production but relatively constant consumption over the year. Farmers have to store maize to bridge seasons, for food security and to protect against price fluctuations. However, the traditional storage methods do not protect grain well, resulting in large postharvest losses. Hermetically sealed metal silos kill storage pests by oxygen deprivation without pesticides. Popular in Central America, they are now being promoted in Africa, but their impact here has not yet been studied. This study used propensity score matching to evaluate the impact of metal silos on duration of maize storage, loss abatement, cost of storage, and household food security. Metal silo adopters (N = 116) were matched with non-adopting farmers from a representative sample of 1340 households covering the major maize-growing zones in Kenya. The major effect of the metal silos was an almost complete elimination of losses due to insect pests, saving farmers an average of 150-200 kg of grain, worth KSh9750 (US$130). Metal silo adopters also spent about KSh340 less on storage insecticides. Adopters were able to store their maize for 1.8-2.4 months longer, and to sell their surplus after five months at good prices, instead of having to sell right after the harvest. The period of inadequate food provision among adopters was reduced by more than one month. We conclude that metal silos are effective in reducing grain losses due to maize-storage insects, and that they have a large impact on the welfare and food security of farm households. The initial cost of metal silos is high (KSh20,000/1.8 ton) and therefore policies to increase access to credit, to reduce the cost of sheet metal, and to promote collective action can improve their uptake by smallholder farmers.

T1  - Change and diversity in smallholder rice-fish systems: Recent evidence and policy lessons from Bangladesh
AN  - 1541993984; 2011-661914
AB  - Efforts to unlock the genetic potential of both rice and fish, when combined with improvements in the management of rice-fish systems, can potentially increase agricultural productivity and food security in some of the poorest and most populous countries in Asia. In Bangladesh, estimates suggest that the country's potential rice-fish production system encompasses 2-3 million hectares of land. But despite three decades of research on biophysical and technical aspects of rice-fish systems, this potential has not been fully realized due to insufficient attention given to the social, economic, and policy dimensions of rice-fish system improvement. This paper provides a characterization of the diverse and changing nature of rice-fish systems in Bangladesh to shed new light on the economic viability of different rice-fish systems and recommend policy and investment options to accelerate the development of appropriate rice-fish technologies. Data are drawn from a novel subdistrict-level survey of fishery officers, a household/enterprise survey, focus group discussions, and a meta-review of the literature on aquaculture in the country, all of which were conducted in 2010-2011. Findings indicate that concurrent rice-fish systems, alternating rice-fish systems, and collectively managed systems offer considerable potential for increasing productivity and farm incomes in Bangladesh. Findings also suggest that while innovation in these rice-fish systems is being driven by households and communities, there is need for more supportive government policies and investments to enable further innovation. Policymakers need to develop effective regulations to promote feed and fish quality and quantity, for example. More rigorous analysis of the intended and unintended impacts of these policies and investments is also necessary. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

T1  - Sesame production expands in Mali
AN  - 1468874197
AB  - In Mali, IFDC has set up its Grassroots Development of Agribusiness Clusters in Mali (DEBPEA) Project which aims to add value to agricultural crops. Most recently it has been looking at sesame, which is a potentially lucrative business in Mali, and one in which smallholder farmers and others are willing to invest, especially in adding value. Now IFDC's Development of Sesame Production and Processing for Export from the Mali component of the project is focusing on improving sesame production and marketing. DEBPEA is designed to reinforce and expand agricultural development in Mali. To learn how to improve quality and increase yields, farmers attend workshops and field training in seeding, cultivating and harvesting techniques. Farmer field schools (FFS) training has become more practical, efficient and less expensive. In one FFS lesson, a seed drill was demonstrated. With broader awareness of the profit potential of sesame and news of growing yields, sesame farming is expanding.

T1  - Impact of metal silos on households' maize storage, storage losses and food security: An application of a propensity score matching
AN  - 1466631699
AB  - Maize is the most important food staple in Eastern and Southern Africa, with a highly seasonal production but relatively constant consumption over the year. Farmers have to store maize to bridge seasons, for food security and to protect against price fluctuations. However, the traditional storage methods do not protect grain well, resulting in large postharvest losses. Hermetically sealed metal silos kill storage pests by oxygen deprivation without pesticides. Popular in Central America, they are now being promoted in Africa, but their impact here has not yet been studied. This study used propensity score matching to evaluate the impact of metal silos on duration of maize storage, loss abatement, cost of storage, and household food security. Metal silo adopters (N = 116) were matched with non-adopting farmers from a representative sample of 1340 households covering the major maize-growing zones in Kenya. The major effect of the metal silos was an almost complete elimination of losses due to insect pests, saving farmers an average of 150-200 kg of grain, worth KSh9750 (US$130). Metal silo adopters also spent about KSh340 less on storage insecticides. Adopters were able to store their maize for 1.8-2.4 months longer, and to sell their surplus after five months at good prices, instead of having to sell right after the harvest. The period of inadequate food provision among adopters was reduced by more than one month. We conclude that metal silos are effective in reducing grain losses due to maize-storage insects, and that they have a large impact on the welfare and food security of farm households. The initial cost of metal silos is high (KSh20,000/1.8 ton) and therefore policies to increase access to credit, to reduce the cost of sheet metal, and to promote collective action can improve their uptake by smallholder farmers.

T1  - Change and diversity in smallholder rice-fish systems: Recent evidence and policy lessons from Bangladesh
AN  - 1466631610
AB  - Efforts to unlock the genetic potential of both rice and fish, when combined with improvements in the management of rice-fish systems, can potentially increase agricultural productivity and food security in some of the poorest and most populous countries in Asia. In Bangladesh, estimates suggest that the country's potential rice-fish production system encompasses 2-3 million hectares of land. But despite three decades of research on biophysical and technical aspects of rice-fish systems, this potential has not been fully realized due to insufficient attention given to the social, economic, and policy dimensions of rice-fish system improvement. This paper provides a characterization of the diverse and changing nature of rice-fish systems in Bangladesh to shed new light on the economic viability of different rice-fish systems and recommend policy and investment options to accelerate the development of appropriate rice-fish technologies. Data are drawn from a novel subdistrict-level survey of fishery officers, a household/enterprise survey, focus group discussions, and a meta-review of the literature on aquaculture in the country, all of which were conducted in 2010-2011. Findings indicate that concurrent rice-fish systems, alternating rice-fish systems, and collectively managed systems offer considerable potential for increasing productivity and farm incomes in Bangladesh. Findings also suggest that while innovation in these rice-fish systems is being driven by households and communities, there is need for more supportive government policies and investments to enable further innovation. Policymakers need to develop effective regulations to promote feed and fish quality and quantity, for example. More rigorous analysis of the intended and unintended impacts of these policies and investments is also necessary. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Improved energy efficiency of farmers' cooperative litchi drying operation in Northern Thailand
AN  - 1440838512
AB  - Summary

              
In 2007, Hmong farmers growing litchi in the mountainous region of Northern Thailand started to dry the fruit in response to its declining market price. However, the locally available dryer, although affordable and of a size appropriate for smallholder farmers' cooperatives, showed excessive gas consumption, and this, along with rising fuel costs, imposed a threat to the drying operation. The objective of this study was to test low-cost, easy-to-implement modifications to a locally available convection dryer, to improve its energy efficiency. Experiments were conducted in cooperation with a Hmong farmers' cooperative in Northern Thailand. Insulation of the air ducts and control of the air recirculation rate led to energy cost savings of US$2.45 per dryer-load. With the modifications required being simple, the investment needed was recovered after only approximately 20 loads, while the energy efficiency of the dryer increased from 33% to 39%.

T1  - Understanding contracts in evolving agro-economies: fermers, dekhqans and networks in Khorezm, Uzbekistan
AN  - 1695991057; 4689122
AB  - We combine institutional economic perspectives and actor-network theory to elucidate the role of contracts in the evolution of transitional agricultural systems. Such combination of theories can shed a light on the mutual constitution of actors and institutions, and the formation of economic strategies. We argue that forms and functions of contracts can only be understood in an evolutionary context. In a case study of the Khorezm region, Uzbekistan, where several waves of reform created two principal actors - commercial farms (called fermers locally) responsible for state-ordered production and semi-subsistence smallholders (called dekhqans locally) - it is demonstrated how in the self-transformation of the actor-network, and thus the shifts in forms and roles of contracts, several network features play a role: interdependencies between the actors, the essential actant of the irrigation and drainage system, formal/informal dialectics. Time horizons, risk/benefit calculations, trust and cooperation forms emerge in the self-reproducing network and leave space for certain contractual forms and functions.

T1  - Is Fairtrade certification greening agricultural practices? An analysis of Fairtrade environmental standards in Rwanda
AN  - 1695989769; 4689135
AB  - Empirical assessments of the impacts of Fairtrade certification environmental standards are lacking. This paper examines the effects of Fairtrade certification on agricultural practices through the case of coffee in Rwanda, comparing Fairtrade certified cooperative farmers with non-certified cooperative farmers and farmers who do not belong to a cooperative. Survey data from 175 smallholder coffee farmers in Rwanda are reported and analyzed using logistic regression. The results indicate the importance of cooperative farmer organizations in influencing agricultural practices via opportunities for training and access to inputs, and suggest that Fairtrade certification may in fact provide additional opportunities above and beyond cooperative producer organization that influence farmer agricultural practices. However, counter to expectations, Fairtrade certification does not have a strong overall effect on agricultural practices. The effectiveness of Fairtrade at shifting agricultural practices appears to depend on the national regulatory context and the availability of alternative practices.

T1  - Understanding contracts in evolving agro-economies: Fermers, dekhqans and networks in Khorezm, Uzbekistan
AN  - 1667949720; 201510863
AB  - We combine institutional economic perspectives and actor-network theory to elucidate the role of contracts in the evolution of transitional agricultural systems. Such combination of theories can shed a light on the mutual constitution of actors and institutions, and the formation of economic strategies. We argue that forms and functions of contracts can only be understood in an evolutionary context. In a case study of the Khorezm region, Uzbekistan, where several waves of reform created two principal actors - commercial farms (called fermers locally) responsible for state-ordered production and semi-subsistence smallholders (called dekhqans locally) - it is demonstrated how in the self-transformation of the actor-network, and thus the shifts in forms and roles of contracts, several network features play a role: interdependencies between the actors, the essential actant of the irrigation and drainage system, formal/informal dialectics. Time horizons, risk/benefit calculations, trust and cooperation forms emerge in the self-reproducing network and leave space for certain contractual forms and functions. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Landraces as an adaptation strategy to climate change for smallholders in Santa Catarina, Southern Brazil
AN  - 1438599837; 2011-477509
AB  - Adapting to climate change has become a pressing and urgent issue given the alarming rapidity with which climate changes is taking place. Agriculture is strongly conditioned by climatic factors, but subsistence agriculture is particularly vulnerable because smallholders do not have adequate financial resources to adapt to climate change. Agrobiodiversity provides one option for smallholders to adapt to climate change. Landraces developed in the western region of Santa Catarina State, Brazil, are part of a deliberate strategy by smallholders to achieve a state of food sovereignty and independence from commercial sources of hybrid seed. The ability of smallholders to collectively conserve climate-adapted landraces indicates the depth of local knowledge and capability within local communities that can be drawn on to meet the future challenges of climate change.

T1  - The role of cooperative business models for the success of smallholder coffee certification in Nicaragua: A comparison of conventional, organic and Organic-Fairtrade certified cooperatives
AN  - 1418360759
AB  - Abstract

              
Supported by policy-makers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), coffee farmer organizations obtain organic and Fairtrade certifications to upgrade their coffee and, thus, increase returns to their members. Whether this and other upgrading strategies fit into the business model of the cooperative and lead to success are often not considered. This research aims to identify similarities and differences between conventional and certified cooperatives and the resultant impact on farmers' incomes. We analyze the business models, upgrading strategies, and strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of seven conventional, organic and Organic-Fairtrade certified coffee cooperatives and link these to members' coffee gross margins. We use data from over 100 in-depth qualitative interviews and a household survey of 327 cooperative members in northern Nicaragua. Results indicate that cooperatives often apply the same upgrading strategies despite very different business models and SWOT. There are also many commonalities of SWOT among cooperatives but no clear-cut differences between conventional, organic and Organic-Fairtrade certified cooperatives. The qualitative comparison of coffee gross margins among the cooperatives shows no clear income effect from participating in certified coffee production and certified cooperatives. It indicates, rather, dependence of gross margins on yield levels, the business model and upgrading strategies of the cooperatives. Upgrading through certification seems only successful with a suitable business model and other upgrading strategies. Policies should focus on (i) increasing as well as stabilizing coffee yields, and (ii) on the institutional framework of cooperatives by offering strategic support, credit access, external auditing of cooperatives and the establishment of a functional national coffee institute.

T1  - Productivity effects of land rental market operation in Ethiopia: evidence from a matched tenant-landlord sample
AN  - 1267024821; 4380577
AB  - As countries increasingly strive to transform their economies from agriculture-;based into a diversified one, land rental will become of greater importance. It will thus be critical to complement research on the efficiency of specific land rental arrangements such as sharecropping with an inquiry into the broader productivity impacts of the land rental market. Plot-;level data for a matched landlord-tenant sample in an environment where sharecropping dominates allow us to explore both issues. We find that pure output sharing leads to significantly lower levels of efficiency that can be attenuated by monitoring while the inefficiency disappears if inputs are shared as well. Rentals transfer land to more productive producers but realization of this productivity advantage is prevented by the inefficiency of contractual arrangements, suggesting changes that would prompt adoption of different contractual arrangements could have significant benefits.

T1  - Extending the margins of marketization: frontier regions and the making of agro-export markets in northern Ghana
AN  - 1461648645; 4505459
AB  - This paper demonstrates how the global commodity chain approach has mutated from a critical tool for studying the production of inequality in the global economy to an instrument of development policy that extends the frontiers of marketization to so-called âperipheriesâ in the Global South. Taking an outgrower scheme for the global production of organic mangoes in northern Ghana as point of departure, and situating this case study within the broader context of market experiments in the Ghanaian agricultural sector, it develops an account of global capitalism as a diverse, heterogeneous and messy arrangement of local borderlands. As a zone of inclusive exclusion these borderlands are brought into being by an economic discourse which separates the inside of the capitalist world from its supposed outside. The so-called integration of smallholders into global markets relies on exclusionary representations and the forging of new associations. First, economic practices in northern Ghana are portrayed by economists as defective and in doing so determine what lies outside the market. Second, within this âoutsideâ â on which the âinsideâ actually depends â global capitalism mediated through the market models and rhetoric of international development organizations now literally touches the ground in specific geographical settings. Hence Frontier regions as represented by our case study bear the paradoxical character of the work of economics and are an instructive example for the performative power of economic theories. Marketization is revealed as a complex and socio-technically entangled process full of hidden prerequisites and unforeseen consequences that open up new social spaces of multiple ontological reconfigurations.

T1  - Contract farming configuration: Smallholders' preferences for contract design attributes
AN  - 1448772316; 2011-490522
AB  - While Contract Farming (CF) can enhance smallholders' income in developing countries, empirical research on the motivation of smallholders to participate in CF is scarce. This paper explores farmer preferences for particular contract design attributes. We combined analytical hierarchy process and discrete choice experiments to investigate the importance of contract design attributes. On the basis of data collected among potato farmers in Ethiopia, we found that input market uncertainty is more important than output market uncertainty in smallholders' decision to participate. Farmers tend to minimize their risk by opting for the buyer firm above the state and NGOs as providers of seed, inputs, and technical assistance. The results imply that the success of a CF scheme depends on the willingness of the firm to incorporate the preferred contract design attributes. Institutional intervention in the input market could induce agribusiness firms to offer attractive contracts for smallholders. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

T1  - Social influence and collective action effects on farm level soil conservation effort in rural Kenya
AN  - 1438601409; 2011-491331
AB  - This paper analyzes the effects of social influence and participation in collective action initiatives on soil conservation effort among smallholder farmers in Lake Naivasha basin, Kenya. We apply binary and ordered probit models in a two stage regression procedure to cross-sectional data collected through a household survey among randomly selected smallholder farmers. Smallholder farming systems in the research area are associated with practices that render farmlands susceptible to soil erosion causing negative impacts on land and the environment. Therefore, strategies that encourage soil conservation are likely to also offer solutions for dealing with agri-environmental challenges and poverty alleviation. Results indicate that social capital facilitates participation in collective action initiatives which then influence individual soil conservation efforts. Neighborhood social influences, subjective norms, gender, education level, farm size, access to credit and livestock ownership also emerge as key determinants of soil conservation effort. Policy implications drawn by this study encourage strategies to increase participation and effectiveness in collective action initiatives as a boost to soil conservation. Implementation of soil conservation practices could also be encouraged through awareness increasing instruments, facilitating access to agricultural micro-credit and paying attention to gender related challenges on knowledge access and rights over land and other natural resources.

T1  - Contract farming configuration: Smallholders' preferences for contract design attributes
AN  - 1364608207
AB  - While Contract Farming (CF) can enhance smallholders' income in developing countries, empirical research on the motivation of smallholders to participate in CF is scarce. This paper explores farmer preferences for particular contract design attributes. We combined analytical hierarchy process and discrete choice experiments to investigate the importance of contract design attributes. On the basis of data collected among potato farmers in Ethiopia, we found that input market uncertainty is more important than output market uncertainty in smallholders' decision to participate. Farmers tend to minimize their risk by opting for the buyer firm above the state and NGOs as providers of seed, inputs, and technical assistance. The results imply that the success of a CF scheme depends on the willingness of the firm to incorporate the preferred contract design attributes. Institutional intervention in the input market could induce agribusiness firms to offer attractive contracts for smallholders. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Is contract farming in the Indonesian oil palm industry pro-poor?
AN  - 1496955623; 4524003
AB  - This paper assesses the impact of contract farming in the oil palm industry in Indonesia on smallholders' well-being and investigates its implication for poverty reduction. Data were collected using random sampling from 245 smallholders in the province of Jambi, Sumatra. A treatment effects model was applied in order to capture endogeneity and selection bias. Results show that participation in contract farming is significantly associated with type of household, age of household head, size of oil palm plot, and the time of plantation establishment. While contract farming has a significant positive effect on smallholder income overall, it discriminates against poorer smallholders. It is recommended that the agro industry and government review contractual arrangements in order to increase the chances of the poor benefiting from oil palm expansion in Indonesia.

T1  - Transaction costs of carbon offset projects: A comparative study
AN  - 1438600183; 2011-491246
AB  - The land-use change and forestry sector can be a cost-effective contributor to climate mitigation in at least three ways: providing carbon offsets through carbon sequestration in biomass and soils, reducing emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases, and producing biofuels that replace fossil fuels. The presence of carbon markets should help encourage these activities; however, most carbon trades to date have occurred in the energy sector. A major obstacle to carbon trades from land-use systems is the presence of high transaction costs of converting a carbon offset into a tradable commodity, so the prevailing market carbon prices may not provide enough incentive for adoption. This paper presents a model of the exchange of carbon offsets between a project developer and a group of landholders. The model is solved to derive project feasibility frontiers that show the minimum number of contracts necessary to make a project feasible at any given carbon price. The model is applied to two case studies (smallholder agroforestry in Indonesia and partial reforestation of family farms in Australia) under two types of contract (purchase of carbon flows and rental of carbon stocks). The paper concludes by identifying possible strategies to reduce transaction costs while maintaining project integrity. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

T1  - Disentangling the Effects of Fair Trade on the Quality of Malian Cotton
AN  - 1318930638
AB  - The increasing importance of premium segments and private labels raise skepticism about the ability of Fair Trade to help smallholders compete in high value-added markets. Using panel data collected in Mali, this paper contributes to the debate by estimating the impact of Fairtrade certification on the quality of Malian cotton. Controlling for the nonrandom certification of producers, results show a significant impact on the quality of cotton produced by both certified and geographically close noncertified growers via spillover effects. The analysis suggests that contract farming enforced by third-parties and demonstration effects foster the adoption of innovative agricultural practices. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Global-Local Tensions in Contract Farming of Biofuel Crops Involving Indigenous Communities in the Philippines
AN  - 1735658375; 2011-477039
AB  - Farming of biofuel crops by local communities under contract with parastatal and private firms is being established in the Philippines and elsewhere. This study explores tensions in integrating indigenous peoples into the global biofuels network. Drawing from critical perspectives on contract farming and from the environmental sociology of networks and flows, we examine production relations associated with contract farming of Jatropha on indigenous lands in the Philippines. In on-site observations and interviews, we found that while some indigenous groups grow Jatropha in polyculture, shifting-cultivation systems as part of biofuel contracts, these smallholder production systems are being phased out or transformed by the global biofuels network. In contract farming relationships involving biofuel crops, there seems to be a greater tendency for indigenous peoples to adapt to, or be left outside of, global production networks than for the latter to include indigenous peoples in socially and ecologically sustainable ways.

T1  - New Geographies of Water and Climate Change in Peru: Coupled Natural and Social Transformations in the Santa River Watershed
AN  - 1417542346; 2011-445727
AB  - Projections of future water shortages in the world's glaciated mountain ranges have grown increasingly dire. Although water modeling research has begun to examine changing environmental parameters, the inclusion of social scenarios has been very limited. Yet human water use and demand are vital for long-term adaptation, risk reduction, and resource allocation. Concerns about future water supplies are particularly pronounced on Peru's arid Pacific slope, where upstream glacier recession has been accompanied by rapid and water-intensive economic development. Models predict water shortages decades into the future, but conflicts have already arisen in Peru's Santa River watershed due to either real or perceived shortages. Modeled thresholds do not align well with historical realities and therefore suggest that a broader analysis of the combined natural and social drivers of change is needed to more effectively understand the hydrologic transformation taking place across the watershed. This article situates these new geographies of water and climate change in Peru within current global change research discussions to demonstrate how future coupled research models can inform broader scale questions of hydrologic change and water security across watersheds and regions. We provide a coupled historical analysis of glacier recession in the Cordillera Blanca, declining Santa River discharge, and alpine wetland contraction. We also examine various water withdrawal mechanisms, including smallholder agriculture, mining, potable water use, hydroelectric power generation, and coastal irrigation. We argue that both ecological change and societal forces will play vital roles in shaping the future of water resources and water governance in the region. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The impact of cooperatives on agricultural technology adoption: Empirical evidence from Ethiopia
AN  - 1448772528; 2011-490567
AB  - Using cross-sectional data and a propensity score matching technique, this paper investigates the impact of cooperatives on adoption of agricultural technologies. Our analysis indicates that cooperative members are more likely to be male-headed households, have better access to agricultural extension services, possess oxen, participate in off-farm work, and have leadership experience. We also found that geographic location and age of household head are strongly associated with cooperative membership. Our estimation results show that cooperative membership has a strong positive impact on fertilizer adoption. The impact on adoption of pesticides turns out to be statistically significant when only agricultural cooperatives are considered. Further analysis also suggests that cooperative membership has a heterogeneous impact on fertilizer adoption among its members. The results suggest that cooperatives can play an important role in accelerating the adoption of agricultural technologies by smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

Our analysis indicates that cooperative members are more likely to be male-headed households, have better access to agricultural extension services, possess oxen, participate in off-farm work, and have leadership experience. We also found that geographic location and age of household head are strongly associated with cooperative membership. Our estimation results show that cooperative membership has a strong positive impact on fertilizer adoption. The impact on adoption of pesticides turns out to be statistically significant when only agricultural cooperatives are considered. Further analysis also suggests that cooperative membership has a heterogeneous impact on fertilizer adoption among its members. The results suggest that cooperatives can play an important role in accelerating the adoption of agricultural technologies by smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assessing the adaptation strategies of farmers facing multiple stressors: lessons from the coffee and global changes project in Mesoamerica
AN  - 1282039481; 4390883
AB  - This paper analyzes the challenges and opportunities entailed in the design, implementation and dissemination of an interdisciplinary project that evolved into a knowledge co-production effort. The project explored the livelihood strategies of coffee growers in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica facing multiple stressors of economic (market shocks and price volatility) and physical nature (climate variability and pest incidence). Our objective was to determine the factors that influence farmers' decisions and the implications of those decisions for the people and the landscapes of the region. To achieve this objective, we intended to engage farm communities and sector representatives in the research process, and to a large extent this intent was realized. Nevertheless, the project illustrates the difficulties in achieving knowledge ''co-production'' with stakeholders whose day-to-day existence focuses on issues largely outside the domain of the research program. We adopted decision-analysis tools to integrate our knowledge and hypotheses to find a common language and structure for our research design. In relation to regional and national policy makers and sector experts, we aimed to communicate the decision-environment of the smallholder producer to enhance awareness of the institutional opportunities and constraints in the adaptation process. For the farmers themselves, we aimed to serve as conduits and mirrors of their own knowledge, rather than serving as external authorities on issues that appeared to be of little interest to them. Through the course of the project, we experimented with diverse modes of stakeholder interaction and, through collaboration with local experts in communication strategies, identified a set of tools for successful dissemination of results. The credibility and direct ties of the participating research organizations and collaborating institutes with the local communities were often an asset, sometimes a complication, but always a critical factor in the process of stakeholder interaction. The messages constructed from the collective knowledge of local farmers in distinct regions in four countries with different social and institutional histories represent crucial information for policy makers who are looking to support the adaptation processes of rural people facing changes of a global nature. However, communicating these messages in a usable and useful way to decision makers at various levels proved to be challenging. All rights reserved, Elsevier

T1  - New geographies of water and climate change in Peru: coupled natural and social transformations in the Santa River Watershed
AN  - 1441807602; 4490503
AB  - Projections of future water shortages in the world's glaciated mountain ranges have grown increasingly dire. Although water modeling research has begun to examine changing environmental parameters, the inclusion of social scenarios has been very limited. Yet human water use and demand are vital for long-term adaptation, risk reduction, and resource allocation. Concerns about future water supplies are particularly pronounced on Peru's arid Pacific slope, where upstream glacier recession has been accompanied by rapid and water-intensive economic development. Models predict water shortages decades into the future, but conflicts have already arisen in Peru's Santa River watershed due to either real or perceived shortages. Modeled thresholds do not align well with historical realities and therefore suggest that a broader analysis of the combined natural and social drivers of change is needed to more effectively understand the hydrologic transformation taking place across the watershed. This article situates these new geographies of water and climate change in Peru within current global change research discussions to demonstrate how future coupled research models can inform broader scale questions of hydrologic change and water security across watersheds and regions. We provide a coupled historical analysis of glacier recession in the Cordillera Blanca, declining Santa River discharge, and alpine wetland contraction. We also examine various water withdrawal mechanisms, including smallholder agriculture, mining, potable water use, hydroelectric power generation, and coastal irrigation. We argue that both ecological change and societal forces will play vital roles in shaping the future of water resources and water governance in the region. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Distributional effects of agricultural cooperatives in China: Exclusion of smallholders and potential gains on participation
AN  - 1448772214; 2011-490558
AB  - This paper examines the treatment effects of the agricultural cooperative and publicly funded extension services on individual household economy, using data collected by the author from watermelon-producing farm households in rural Nanjing. The cooperative addressed in this study restricts the participation of small-scale farmers, implying that selection into the program must be taken into consideration for an accurate assessment of the treatment effect. The econometric analysis revealed that government extension services have a modest effect on farm income. In contrast, the treatment effect of the agricultural cooperative is robust and substantially large, accounting for nearly 70% of the pre-matching difference. This suggests that the agricultural cooperative system is an important avenue for farmers to improve their economic status. The treatment effect of the agricultural cooperative is highly heterogeneous; the economic benefits arising from the cooperative are significant only for small-scale farms. We can argue that a coexistence of smallholder exclusion and the treatment effect in favor of small-scale farms poses serious challenges to pro-poor agricultural growth in China.

T1  - Impacts of tenancy arrangements on investment and efficiency: evidence from Pakistan
AN  - 1125843762
AB  - In this article, we use farm-level data from the Punjab Province in Pakistan to analyze the impact of three tenancy contracts on investment in soil-improving and productivity-enhancing measures and farm productivity. A multivariate tobit model that accounts for potential substitutability and complementarity of investment options, as well as endogeneity of tenure arrangements was employed in the empirical analysis. Our empirical results indicate that land tenure arrangements influence farmers' decisions to invest in soil-improving and productivity-enhancing measures. In particular, owner-cultivators with secured tenancy arrangements were found to be more likely to invest in soil-improving and productivity-enhancing measures, compared to those on leased contracts. We also find that output per hectare was highest on land cultivated by owners and lowest on land under sharecropping tenancy, lending support to the Marshallian inefficiency hypothesis.

T1  - Sharecropping in Non-traditional Agro-export Production: The Abougnon Contract for Pineapple Cultivation in Cote d'Ivoire
AN  - 1266174174; 2011-335421
AB  - This article highlights the role of sharecropping in small-scale, non-traditional export production, through the case of pineapple production in Cote d'Ivoire. The study reveals the diversity of contractual configurations with respect to the same crop, under the same local term of abougnon. Beyond a description of contractual practices, the article explores the rationale for share contracts in a context of imperfect tenancy, labour and credit markets. The analysis of actors' rationales in entering abougnon contracts points out the role of financing constraints and disequilibrium in the tenancy market. It highlights the secondary role played by transaction costs induced by moral hazard, incentives or -- up to the crisis that struck down the sector -- production and market risks. This in-depth, localised longitudinal case study relies on first-hand data collected through intensive fieldwork conducted in the village of Djimini-Koffikro in 1983-1984 and 2002-2003, updated in 2010.

T1  - Sharecropping in non-traditional agro-export production: the Abougnon contract for pineapple cultivation in côte d'ivoire
AN  - 1230587855; 4372940
AB  - This article highlights the role of sharecropping in small-scale, non-traditional export production, through the case of pineapple production in Côte d'Ivoire. The study reveals the diversity of contractual configurations with respect to the same crop, under the same local term of abougnon. Beyond a description of contractual practices, the article explores the rationale for share contracts in a context of imperfect tenancy, labour and credit markets. The analysis of actors' rationales in entering abougnon contracts points out the role of financing constraints and disequilibrium in the tenancy market. It highlights the secondary role played by transaction costs induced by moral hazard, incentives or - up to the crisis that struck down the sector - production and market risks. This in-depth, localised longitudinal case study relies on first-hand data collected through intensive fieldwork conducted in the village of Djimini-Koffikro in 1983-1984 and 2002-2003, updated in 2010.

T1  - Impact of policies favouring organic inputs on small farms in Karnataka, India: a multicriteria approach
AN  - 1022119025; 4308274
AB  - Over 56% of the population of Karnataka state in India depends on agriculture for its livelihood. A majority of these are small and marginal farmers, with land under 2_ha, responsible for nearly half the food production in the state. The increasing rate of farmers' suicides in the state is reportedly fuelled among others, by increasing input costs, crop failure and accumulating debt. This triggered several policy measures, intended to improve the sustainability of farm livelihoods including those promoting organic practices in farming. The paper presents the results of a multicriteria analysis conducted to comprehend the effects of two different practice-policy scenarios on smallholders in Karnataka - one scenario 'with policy' (WP) to support organic agricultural practices and the other a 'business as usual' (BAU) scenario that continues to stress on market-based, synthetic inputs for cultivation. The paper integrates results from quantitative and participatory techniques to compare and project effects on ecological, economic and socio-cultural indicators. Ecological and economic indicators in WP are projected to be significantly higher than BAU in a majority of the study sites, while socio-cultural indicators show mixed outcomes, depending on regional and social characteristics. Across the study sites, small and rain-fed farms are benefitted better in WP compared to large and irrigated farms, respectively. Among small and rain-fed farms, soil fertility, water quality, agro-diversity, net income and freedom from indebtedness improve considerably, while there is slight reduction in collective activities and no perceivable change in land-based subsistence.

T1  - As You Sow, So Shall You Reap: The Welfare Impacts of Contract Farming
AN  - 1728648906; 2011-291631
AB  - Contract farming is widely perceived as a means of increasing welfare in developing countries. Because of smallholder self-selection in contract farming, however, it is not clear whether contract farming actually increases grower welfare. In an effort to improve upon existing estimates of the welfare impacts of contract farming, this paper uses the results of a contingent-valuation experiment to control for unobserved heterogeneity among smallholders. Using data across several regions, firms, and crops in Madagascar, results indicate that a 1-percent increase in the likelihood of participating in contract farming is associated with a 0.5-percent increase in household income, among other positive impacts.

T1  - Gendered experiences of dispossession: oil palm expansion in a Dayak Hibun community in West Kalimantan
AN  - 1283639611; 201304025
AB  - This article explores the gendered experience of monocrop oil-palm expansion in a Hibun Dayak community in Sanggau District, West Kalimantan (Indonesia). It shows how the expanding corporate plantation and contract farming system has undermined the position and livelihood of indigenous women in this already patriarchal community. The shifting of land tenure from the community to the state and the practice of the 'family head' system of smallholder plot registration has eroded women's rights to land, and women are becoming a class of plantation labour. At the same time, as in other cases of expansion of agrarian corporate commodity production, we can discern a familiar pattern of ambivalence between, on the one hand, the attractions of regular cash income and, on the other, the loss of resource tenure and autonomy, which helps to explain the community's gendered experience of coercion, exploitation, intimidation, consent and resistance.

T1  - A Socio-Ecological Investigation of Options to Manage Groundwater Degradation in the Western Desert, Egypt
AN  - 1023658516; 22569842
AB  - Under increasing water scarcity, collective groundwater management is a global concern. This article presents an interdisciplinary analysis of this challenge drawing on a survey including 50 large and small farms and gardens in a village in an agricultural land reclamation area on the edge of the Western Desert of Egypt. Findings revealed that smallholders rely on a practice of shallow groundwater use, through which drainage water from adjacent irrigation areas is effectively recycled within the surface aquifer. Expanding agroindustrial activities in the surrounding area are socio-economically important, but by mining non-renewable water in the surrounding area, they set in motion a degradation process with social and ecological consequences for all users in the multi-layered aquifer system. Based on the findings of our investigation, we identify opportunities for local authorities to more systematically connect available environmental information sources and common pool resource management precedents, to counterbalance the degradation threat.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Returns to scope? Smallholders' commercialisation through multipurpose cooperatives in Ethiopia
AN  - 1418129038; 4451711
AB  - This paper addresses the extent to which the scope of smallholder cooperatives' activities may affect their performance in marketing their members' surplus output. Previous papers have highlighted such effects and explained it by the extra burden that diversified activities impose on the often limited management capacities of these organisations. We propose an alternative explanation, linking the scope of activities to membership structure: marketing cooperatives engaging in a vast array of unrelated activities may lose their marketing-oriented members for those more interested in the new activities proposed. The model's predictions are supported by recently collected data on 172 smallholder grain marketing cooperatives in Ethiopia. Implications for the support of farmer organisations are derived and discussed in conclusion. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] Reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press

T1  - Linking Smallholders to Markets: Determinants and Impacts of Farmer Collective Action in Kenya
AN  - 1012274073
AB  - This article investigates determinants and impacts of cooperative organization, using the example of smallholder banana farmers in Kenya. Farmer groups are inclusive of the poor, although wealthier households are more likely to join. Employing propensity score matching, we find positive income effects for active group members. Yet price advantages of collective marketing are small, and high-value market potentials have not yet been tapped. Beyond prices, farmer groups function as important catalysts for innovation adoption through promoting efficient information flows. We discuss the conditions under which collective action is useful, and through what mechanisms the potential benefits emerge. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Gendered experiences of dispossession: oil palm expansion in a Dayak Hibun community in West Kalimantan
AN  - 1017853674
AB  - This article explores the gendered experience of monocrop oil-palm expansion in a Hibun Dayak community in Sanggau District, West Kalimantan (Indonesia). It shows how the expanding corporate plantation and contract farming system has undermined the position and livelihood of indigenous women in this already patriarchal community. The shifting of land tenure from the community to the state and the practice of the 'family head' system of smallholder plot registration has eroded women's rights to land, and women are becoming a class of plantation labour. At the same time, as in other cases of expansion of agrarian corporate commodity production, we can discern a familiar pattern of ambivalence between, on the one hand, the attractions of regular cash income and, on the other, the loss of resource tenure and autonomy, which helps to explain the community's gendered experience of coercion, exploitation, intimidation, consent and resistance.

T1  - Drivers of adoption of eucalypt tree farming by smallholders in Thailand
AN  - 921298617
AB  - Eucalypt (Eucalyptus spp.) tree farming is a source of income for many smallholders in developing and emerging countries and critical to the resource supply of many pulp and paper companies. These companies rely on smallholders adopting tree farming, sometimes by offering a contract. This paper reports a study from four regions of Thailand, where smallholder eucalypt tree farming is important, which investigated what characteristics of smallholders were associated with greater adoption of tree farming. A total of 461 eucalypt tree farmers and 171 non-tree farmers were randomly selected and surveyed in these regions, using a door-to-door household survey. A logit analysis corroborated hypotheses about the drivers of adoption. Qualitative analyses were used to inform interpretation of the quantitative results and shed light on the role of eucalypt tree farming in smallholders' livelihood. Results demonstrate that those with suitable land available are more likely to adopt eucalypt tree farming than others. In addition, perception of land tenure security matters in the adoption of tree growing, but holding a formal land tenure document does not. Adoption of eucalypt tree farming in Thailand is not part of a land use intensification strategy. Instead, eucalypts are used as an alternative crop for low productivity land, on which eucalypts are the most profitable crop. Eucalypt tree farming also gives smallholders an opportunity to diversify their income. In addition, this alternative land use has the advantage of requiring low labour inputs between planting and harvest. This is particularly advantageous for many tree growers who have off-farm income or rely on hired labour for farming their land.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 915652352
AB  - Most studies of tenurial insecurity focus on its effects on investment. This paper studies the hitherto unexplored relationship between tenurial insecurity and land tenancy contracts. Based on distinct features of formal law and customary rights in Madagascar, this paper augments the canonical model of sharecropping by making the strength of the landlord's property right increasing in the amount of risk she bears within the contract. Using data on landlords' subjective perceptions in rural Madagascar, empirical tests support the hypothesis that insecure property rights drive contract choice but offer little support in favor of the canonical risk sharing hypothesis.

T1  - Smallholder Marketing Cooperatives and Smallholders' Market Access: Lessons Learned from the Actors Involved
AN  - 1037908936; EJ973317
AB  - Purpose: This article explores the views of Smallholder Marketing Cooperatives' (SMCs) leaders and staff, to gain insight about the particular roles SMCs play in facilitating smallholders' market access. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conceptualized and executed two international workshops in which participants from 42 SMCs from 24 countries deliberated their lessons learned from real-life experiences. Findings: Participants defined three core issues to be tackled by SMCs to play their role related to facilitating their members' market access: good FO governance and management; access to capital and networking. They highlighted that smallholders' market access improves not only as a result of SMCs networking and negotiation with key actors in the public and private sectors, but also due to improved interrelationships among SMCs and other types of Farmers' Organizations (FOs). Peer-to-peer relationships with other SMCs are critical for mutual learning, collaboration and collective action. Practical implications: Peer-to-peer relationships among SMCs are crucial for them to overcome the internal and external social dilemmas SMCs are bound to face while improving smallholders' market access. This goes beyond the three kinds of relationships that scholars have pointed out thus far needed for effective FO development (relationships with members; the public sector and civil society; and with market players). This can be promoted and supported by development programmes. Originality/value: Most SMC studies concentrate primarily on their efficiency in production and marketing activities. This research proposes looking beyond this perspective, using a qualitative approach to explore the real-life experiences and views of actors involved. (Contains 3 tables, 4 figures and 1 note.)

T1  - Market structure, outgrower contracts, and farm output. Evidence from cotton reforms in Zambia
AN  - 928989499; 4276095
AB  - This paper investigates the dynamic impacts of cotton marketing reforms on farm output in rural Zambia. Following liberalization and the elimination of the Zambian cotton marketing board, the sector developed an outgrower scheme whereby cotton firms provided credit, access to inputs and output markets, and technical assistance to the farmers. There are two distinctive phases of the reforms: a failure of the outgrower contracts, due to farmers' debt renegation, firm hold up, and lack of coordination among firms and farms, and a subsequent period of success of the scheme, due to enhanced contract enforcement and commitment. We find interesting dynamics in the sector. During the phase of failure, farmers were pushed back into subsistence and cotton yields per hectare declined. With the improvement of the outgrower scheme, farmers devoted larger shares of land to cash crops, and farm output significantly increased. Reprinted by permission of Oxford University Press

T1  - Cooperatives, Politics, and Development in Rural Paraguay
AN  - 1728661826; 201534407
AB  - Although national politics and policies strongly influence how cooperatives function, cooperative organizations and advisors increasingly envision cooperatives as primarily economic organizations and avoid direct political engagement and social mobilization. In this paper, we discuss and challenge the depoliticization of cooperatives based on research into how two Paraguayan cooperatives dealt with the aftermath of a debt forgiveness law for small fanners. The law was a major victory for peasant political organizations, but its benefits did not extend to all smallholders, generating discontent that threatened both cooperatives and their development strategies. The cooperatives' differing responses to these challenges underscore how policy effects and development strategies are shaped by local level decision making based on organizational histories and emergent opportunities. To conclude, we discuss the advantages and challenges of politicizing cooperatives and offer reflections on how these challenges might be overcome. . Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Soy, cotton, and the final Atlantic forest frontier
AN  - 884841727; 4224823
AB  - From 1945 to 2000, the extent of Paraguay's Atlantic Forest was reduced from 73,000 to 12,000 square kilometers. Deforestation rates were exceptionally high from the late 1960s through to the end of the century. During this period, dual agricultural frontiers pushed into the region from both east and west, resulting in a production landscape defined by two principal commodities: soybeans and cotton. This article considers the expansion and contraction of these industries and addresses their impacts on the region's forest cover. Findings suggest that the role of cotton and smallholder agriculture has been greatly diminished as a driver of land cover change in the region since 1990. High rates of forest loss were sustained, however, partly as a result of continued pressure for agricultural expansion for soy production. Reprinted by permission of Routledge, Taylor and Francis

T1  - Linking Smallholder Farmers to Markets, Gender and Intra-Household Dynamics: Does the Choice of Commodity Matter?
AN  - 871742295
AB  - Linking smallholder farmers to markets and making markets work for the poor is increasingly becoming an important part of the global research and development agenda. Organizations have used various strategies to link farmers to markets. These approaches have mainly been evaluated for their potential to increase participation in markets and household incomes. The evaluations have assumed a unitary household where income and resources are pooled and allocated according to a joint utility function. In most households, however, income is rarely pooled and neither are resources jointly allocated. This article uses data from Malawi and Uganda to analyze what influences income distribution between men and women, focusing on the type of commodity, type of market and approaches used. The results indicate that commodities generating lower average revenues are more likely to be controlled by women, whereas men control commodities that are high revenue generators, often sold in formal markets.

T1  - Highly Optimized Tolerant (HOT) Farms in Rondonia: Productivity and Farm Size, and Implications for Environmental Licensing
AN  - 925720628; 2011-171490
AB  - This paper operationalizes the concept of highly optimized tolerance (HOT) for the case of smallholder agriculture in Rondonia, Brazil. It seeks to understand how characteristics of family farms shift as a function of property size, arguing that as production intensifies, properties move closer to a HOT state. In this state, resources are committed to maintaining robustness against expected disturbances, such as shifts in yields or crop prices, making property more vulnerable to other unexpected disturbances, such as shifts in input prices or availability. The shifts in production, labor, and costs that occur across scale in the Ji-Parana River Basin in Rondonia were measured using a survey instrument on a sample of farmers in the basin. Study results show decreasing production intensity with increasing property size in the sample, coupled with decreasing contracted and family labor use intensity, as well as decreased income diversification and off-farm labor. Farms smaller than 60 ha in the sample differed markedly in production and cost structure from those that were larger. For these smaller properties, meeting the requirements of Rondonia's new environmental licensing program (LAPRO) may lead to an increase in the sale of land parcels to cover debts and a speeding up of land consolidation in the region.

T1  - Land ownership and productivity in early twentieth-century China: the role of incentives
AN  - 1011597302
AB  - Purpose - This paper seeks to use data from China between 1929 and 1933 and provides new empirical evidence to the debate over the impact of land ownership and land-renting systems on agricultural productivity. Design/methodology/approach - The authors estimate the OLS regression to determine the relationship between land ownership (and land-renting systems) and farmers' productivity. Findings - The findings suggest that land ownership was not a major factor in determining farmers' productivity; instead, agricultural infrastructures and institutions had the greatest influence on agricultural productivity. Furthermore, different renting systems generated different impacts on farmers' behavior: sharecropping reduced farmers' productivity while fixed rental contracts had no significant impact on farmers' productivity. Practical implications - This paper has two important policy implications for developing countries. First, agricultural policy that aims to raise agricultural productivity should focus more on improving agricultural infrastructures and institutions than on blindly supporting land privatization. Second, policymakers should promote fixed rental contracts over share contracts because fixed rental contracts were shown to have a smaller adverse impact on farmers' incentives. Originality/value - This paper uses data from China and provides new evidence on the relative importance of land ownership and agricultural infrastructures/institutions in agricultural production. China is a country with a long agricultural history and a long-standing well-developed tenancy system. The case of China may therefore provide answers to policymakers in other developing countries.

T1  - Adaptive Capacity and Social-Environmental Change: Theoretical and Operational Modeling of Smallholder Coffee Systems Response in Mesoamerican Pacific Rim
AN  - 856636046; 21234565
AB  - Communities who rely directly on the natural environment for their survival typically have developed risk management strategies to enable them to avoid dangerous thresholds of change to their livelihoods. Development policy appropriate for natural resource-based communities requires an understanding of the primary drivers of social-ecological change, the ways in which affected households autonomously respond to such drivers, and the appropriate avenues for intervention to reduce vulnerability. Coffee has been, and still remains, one of the most important commodities of the Mesoamerican region, and hundreds of thousands of smallholder households in the region are dependent in some way on the coffee industry for their livelihood stability. We used the Analytical Network Process to synthesize expert knowledge on the primary drivers of livelihood change in the region as well as the most common household strategies and associated capacities necessary for effective response. The assessment identified both gradual systemic processes as well as specific environmental and market shocks as significant drivers of livelihood change across the region. Agronomic adjustments and new forms of social organization were among the more significant responses of farmers to these changes. The assessment indicates that public interventions in support of adaptation should focus on enhancing farmers' access to market and technical information and finance, as well as on increasing the viability of farmers' organizations and cooperatives.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - From lighter loads to better business: empowering rural women in Kenya
AN  - 1325052381
AB  - When women come together, they are powerful, says Frida Wanjiru Mwai, a 45 year-old farmer, who has six children, and lives in the village of Kiuu, in the Nyeri South District of Central Province. As a girl she watched women in her village mobilise to replace traditional thatched roofs with waterproof corrugated iron. The memory of this collective effort led her to form a women's group in 2002 to buy water storage tanks that were too expensive to purchase individually. Mwai and her friends pooled together and bought the tanks for each member in rotation. Since that time Mwai's group has shown what women can achieve with a little training and good organisation. Thanks to the support of the Central Kenya Dry Area Smallholder and Community Services, the group has expanded, acquired numerous new skills and launched a successful business venture. Slowly, attitudes and roles are shifting. Frida recognises that the project has also brought cultural changes.

T1  - Strengthening understanding and perceptions of mineral fertilizer use among smallholder farmers: evidence from collective trials in western Kenya
AN  - 847980550
AB  - It is widely recognized that mineral fertilizers must play an important part in improving agricultural productivity in western Kenyan farming systems. This paper suggests that for this goal to be realized, farmers' knowledge must be strengthened to improve their understanding of fertilizers and their use. We analyzed smallholder knowledge of fertilizers and nutrient management, and draw practical lessons from empirical collective fertilizer-response experiments. Data were gathered from the collective fertilizer-response trials, through focus group discussions, by participant observation, and via in-depth interviews representing 40 households. The collective trials showed that the application of nitrogen (N) or phosphorous (P) alone was insufficient to enhance yields in the study area. The response to P on the trial plots was mainly influenced by incidences of the parasitic Striga weed, by spatial variability or gradients in soil fertility of the experimental plots, and by interactions with N levels. These results inspired farmer to design and conduct experiments to compare crop performance with and without fertilizer, and between types of fertilizers, or responses on different soils. Participating farmers were able to differentiate types of fertilizer, and understood rates of application and the roles of respective fertilizers in nutrient supply. However, notions were broadly generated by unsteady yield responses when fertilizers were used across different fertility gradients, association with high cost (especially if recommended rates were to be applied), association of fertilizer use with hybrids and certain crops, historical factors, among other main aspects. We identified that strengthening fertilizer knowledge must be tailored within existing, albeit imperfect, systems of crop and animal husbandry. Farmers' perceptions cannot be changed by promoting more fertilizer use alone, but may require a more basic approach that, for example, encourages farmer experimentation and practices to enhance soil properties such as carbon build-up in impoverished local soils.

T1  - Smallholder farmer participation in local and regional food aid procurement: Assessing the benefits and challenges in southwestern Uganda
AN  - 901752339; 2011-124843
AB  - Local and regional food aid procurement (LRP) - the purchase and distribution of food aid within and between developing countries - has recently become a common occurrence. In contrast to traditional methods of food aid provision, which are costly cross-border operations and often slow to respond during emergencies, LRP aims to combat food insecurity in a more effective, economical and contained manner. There is a limited amount of research concerning smallholder involvement in small-scale LRP initiatives. This article explores LRP's impact on smallholder farmers participating in a World Food Programme (WFP) procurement project in southwestern Uganda. It concludes that LRP has some benefits, including providing a ready market and empowering farmers, but WFP's procurement contract development, payment procedures and pricing mechanisms, and difficulties of ensuring participants' household food security, present challenges.

T1  - Rearticulating caste: the global cottonseed commodity chain and the paradox of smallholder capitalism in South India
AN  - 900348163; 4242663
AB  - Cottonseed is an aspirational crop for smallholders newly incorporated in the global cottonseed commodity chain as own-account cultivators in South India. The labor to produce cottonseeds, which are hybrids, in the field is excessive. Multinational and Indian corporations depend on hybridization to protect their intellectual property rights in branded seeds. As wage rates rise and seed prices do not, the outsourcing of cottonseed production to smallholders is attractive to capital. It is mostly the unpaid, family labor of smallholders which now generates exchange value. While smallholders dream of spectacular gains and some success stories seem to support this, growing cottonseed is a risky business and, at times, the returns to smallholders are so low that the very costs of reproducing family labor are unmet; many go into debt. Yet, smallholders from a formerly untouchable caste, or Dalit, community, who just a short while ago worked as 'cottonseed children' for rich farmers are, for the first time, proudly growing cottonseed on 'their own plots of land' and 'laboring for themselves'. To explain this paradox I propose a vernacular calculus of the economic, a noneconomistic grid, for understanding why Dalit smallholders continue this form of production even when they could earn more from wage labor. I argue that the rearticulation of caste in terms of dignity and perceptions of autonomy shape this calculus. I argue further that Dalit smallholders experience the inherent contradictions of capitalism through a 'structure of feeling' marked by perplexity. At a time when smallholder contract farming is being suggested as a new development strategy by the World Bank and questioned by its detractors, a vernacular calculus of the economic and affective experiences marked by perplexity may be more widely relevant as generalized characteristics of smallholder capitalism.

T1  - ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE SEED SECTOR OF RICE IN GUINEA: STAKEHOLDERS, PERCEPTION AND INSTITUTIONAL LINKAGES
AN  - 851257515
AB  - This paper analyses the organization of the rice seed sector in Guinea with the overall objectives to assess how organizational settings affect seed supply to small-scale farmers and to suggest institutional changes that would favour seed service and uptake of varieties. Data were collected in Guinea, West Africa, using focus group discussions with extension workers, farmers, representatives of farmers' associations, agro-input dealers, researchers and non-governmental organization (NGO) staff, and surveys of 91 rice farming households and 41 local seed dealers. Findings suggest that the current institutional settings and perceptions of stakeholders from the formal seed sector inhibit smallholder farmers' access to seed. Seed interventions in the past two decades have mainly relied on the national extension system, the research institute, NGOs, farmers' associations and contract seed producers to ensure seed delivery. Although local seed dealers play a central role in providing seed to farmers, governmental organizations operating in a linear model of formal seed sector development have so far ignored their role. We discuss the need to find common ground and alternative models of seed sector development. In particular we suggest the involvement of local seed dealers in seed development activities to better link the formal and the informal seed systems and improve smallholder farmers' access to seed from the formal sector.

T1  - Agricultural Certification as a Conservation Tool in Latin America
AN  - 847130930
AB  - Along agricultural frontiers, non-governmental organizations are developing agricultural certification systems for use as conservation tools. In this article, we propose a typology of certification systems that we use to frame a critical examination of the efficacy of these systems and their limitations in achieving conservation goals. On the basis of these findings, we recommend improved management practices. Our analysis draws on case studies that examine the use of certification to regulate two very distinct production systems: smallholder shade coffee cooperatives in El Salvador and industrial scale soy and beef operations in the Brazilian Amazon. Despite their disparate contexts, both case studies demonstrate that agricultural certification to achieve conservation goals is difficult to design, implement, and evaluate. Certifiers must enroll consumers and firms who do not prioritize conservation goals, navigate scientific uncertainty regarding best conservation practices, and also market their brand as different from the conventional products. Yet certification continues to expand. In order to grow legitimacy, maximize long-term efficacy, and to achieve stated conservation goals, agricultural certifiers should focus their efforts on key leverage points along supply chains where changes made can have meaningful conservation impacts. They should straightforwardly communicate the limitations, kinks, and challenges of their systems alongside claims of successes without overstating the impacts of their schemes as part of marketing strategies. In doing so they can help to inform and advance environmental governance of agricultural production systems. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ethiopian Agricultural Cooperatives in an Era of Global Commodity Exchange: Does Organisational Form Matter?
AN  - 822560625
AB  - In Ethiopia, agricultural cooperatives are expected to play a key role in linking smallholder farmers to the recently established commodity exchange system. Recent research has found, however, that the commercialisation levels of cooperative members do not differ significantly from those of non-member farmers in Ethiopia. We argue though that the impact of cooperative membership on commercialisation may vary significantly depending on the type of cooperative organisations considered. Applying propensity score matching as well as regression analysis to a set of farm household living in rural areas where the commodity exchange system was to become operational, we consistently find significantly higher commercialisation rates, when compared with non-member famers, for farmers belonging to marketing cooperatives. Livelihood cooperatives, on the other hand, appear to have insignificant or negative impact on Ethiopian farmers' commercialisation. We conclude that the selective inclusion of marketing cooperatives in the commodity exchange system has the potential to simultaneously reduce the rural poverty and maximise agro-commodity commercialisation in Ethiopia.

T1  - Land ownership and productivity in early twentieth-century China: the role of incentives
AN  - 1531924389; 2011-613102
AB  - Purpose -- This paper seeks to use data from China between 1929 and 1933 and provides new empirical evidence to the debate over the impact of land ownership and land-renting systems on agricultural productivity. Design/methodology/approach -- The authors estimate the OLS regression to determine the relationship between land ownership (and land-renting systems) and farmers' productivity. Findings -- The findings suggest that land ownership was not a major factor in determining farmers' productivity; instead, agricultural infrastructures and institutions had the greatest influence on agricultural productivity. Furthermore, different renting systems generated different impacts on farmers' behavior: sharecropping reduced farmers' productivity while fixed rental contracts had no significant impact on farmers' productivity. Practical implications -- This paper has two important policy implications for developing countries. First, agricultural policy that aims to raise agricultural productivity should focus more on improving agricultural infrastructures and institutions than on blindly supporting land privatization. Second, policymakers should promote fixed rental contracts over share contracts because fixed rental contracts were shown to have a smaller adverse impact on farmers' incentives. Originality/value -- This paper uses data from China and provides new evidence on the relative importance of land ownership and agricultural infrastructures/institutions in agricultural production. China is a country with a long agricultural history and a long-standing well-developed tenancy system. The case of China may therefore provide answers to policymakers in other developing countries.

T1  - Catastrophic drought insurance based on the remotely sensed normalised difference vegetation index for smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe
AN  - 1034350122; 4326721
AB  - Index insurance, which indemnifies agricultural producers based on an objectively observable variable that is highly correlated with production losses but which cannot be influenced by the producer, can provide adequate protection against catastrophic droughts without suffering from the moral hazard and adverse selection problems that typically cause conventional agricultural insurance programmes to fail. Using historical maize and cotton yield data from nine districts in Zimbabwe, we find that catastrophic drought insurance contracts based on the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be constructed whose indemnities exhibit higher correlations with yield losses than the conventional rainfall index. In addition the NDVI contracts can be offered within the 5 to 10 per cent premium range considered reasonably affordable to many poor smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe.

T1  - Cooperative patronage: the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi in Kasungu District
AN  - 816375505; 4129775
AB  - This paper estimates the determinants of farmers' decisions to join a rural producer organisation, the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi (NASFAM), in Kasungu District. Data for the study were collected in June and August 2003 using household-level questionnaires and stratified random sampling, where strata were membership status and gender. Probit analysis of 250 farmers shows that off-farm sources of income, distance of the farmer's household from Kasungu District centre, age of the farmer, tobacco farming, education, household level land holding and gender determined the decision to join NASFAM. These results suggest that farmers should be informed of the potential benefits of participating in rural development efforts, and that rural communication and information infrastructure should be improved so as to reduce the costs of information access and transactions in general, if participation in organisations such as NASFAM is to be enhanced.

T1  - Effects of Fair Trade and organic certifications on small-scale coffee farmer households in Central America and Mexico
AN  - 733013679
AB  - We provide a review of sustainable coffee certifications and results from a quantitative analysis of the effects of Fair Trade, organic and combined Fair Trade/organic certifications on the livelihood strategies of 469 households and 18 cooperatives of Central America and Mexico. Certified households were also compared with a non-certified group in each country. To analyze the differences in coffee price, volume, gross revenue and education between certifications, we used the Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) non-parametric test and the Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test as a post-hoc procedure. Household savings, credit, food security and incidence of migration were analyzed through Pearson's chi-square test. Our study corroborated the conditions of economic poverty among small-scale coffee farmer households in Central America and Mexico. All certifications provided a higher price per pound and higher gross coffee revenue than non-certified coffee. However, the average volumes of coffee sold by individual households were low, and many certified farmers did not sell their entire production at certified prices. Certifications did not have a discernable effect on other livelihood-related variables, such as education, and incidence of migration at the household level, although they had a positive influence on savings and credit. Sales to certified markets offer farmers and cooperatives better prices, but the contribution derived from these premiums has limited effects on household livelihoods. This demonstrates that certifications will not single-handedly bring significant poverty alleviation to most coffee-farming families. Although certified coffee markets alone will not resolve the livelihood challenges faced by smallholder households, they could still contribute to broad-based sustainable livelihoods, rural development and conservation processes in coffee regions. This can be done by developing more active partnerships between farmers, cooperatives, certifications and environmental and rural development organizations and researchers in coffee regions. Certifications, especially Fair Trade/organic, have proven effective in supporting capacity building and in serving as networks that leverage global development funding for small-scale coffee-producing households.

AN  - 786990839; 4129428
AB  - We used households as the primary unit of analysis to synthesize agrobiodiversity research in small-scale coffee farms and cooperatives of Nicaragua and El Salvador. Surveys, focus groups, and plant inventories were used to analyze agrobiodiversity and its contribution to livelihoods. Households managed high levels of agrobiodiversity, including 100 shade tree and epiphyte species, food crops, and medicinals. Small farms contained higher levels of agrobiodiversity than larger, collectively managed cooperatives. Households benefited from agrobiodiversity through consumption and sales. To better support agrobiodiversity conservation, our analysis calls for a hybrid approach integrating bottom-up initiatives with the resources from top-down projects.

T1  - Mushrooms boost farm incomes
AN  - 577388880
AB  - In 2005, FARM-Africa's Maendeleo Agricultural Technology Fund introduced a three-year oyster mushroom project to smallholder Chagga farmers in Hai and Siha districts in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania. The project was implemented with the help of the Horticultural Research Institute (HORTI)-Tengeru, and it was the Institute, in 2007 and 2008, who guided the project to improve the access to profitable markets with additional financial assistance from FARM-Africa. Many farmers in Hai District have small farms so mushroom growing is appropriate. Nancy Kaaya, a mushroom researcher at HORTI-Tengeru, says some 573 farmers have so far taken up mushroom growing and have established 13 business support units for the collective marketing of their produce. While Nancy Kaaya wishes to see more farmers producing mushrooms, many farmers are wanting the authorities to help them attain high quality standards in production and packaging to tap into the top notch market, including exporting across East Africa and elsewhere.

T1  - Global Standards, Local Realities: Private Agrifood Governance and the Restructuring of the Kenyan Horticulture Industry
AN  - 860910350
AB  - Over the past decade, private food safety and quality standards have become focal points in the supply chain management of large retailers, reshaping governance patterns in global agrifood chains. In this article, I analyze the relationship between private collective standards and the governance of agrifood markets, using the EUREPGAP/GLOBALGAP standard as a vantage point. I discuss the impact of this standard on the organization of supply chains of fresh vegetables in the Kenyan horticulture industry, focusing on the supply chain relationships and practices among exporters and smallholder farmers. In so doing, I seek to highlight the often-contested nature of the implementation of standards in social fields that are marked by different and distributed principles of evaluating quality, production processes, and legitimate actions in the marketplace. I also reconstruct the challenges and opportunities that exporters and farmers are facing with regard to the implementation of and compliance with standards. Finally, I elaborate on the scope for action that producers and policymakers have under these structures to retain sectoral competitiveness in a global economy of qualities. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Global standards, local realities: private agrifood governance and the restructuring of the Kenyan horticulture industry
AN  - 743811077; 3980269
AB  - Over the past decade, private food safety and quality standards have become focal points in the supply chain management of large retailers, reshaping governance patterns in global agrifood chains. In this article, I analyze the relationship between private collective standards and the governance of agrifood markets, using the EUREPGAP/GLOBALGAP standard as a vantage point. I discuss the impact of this standard on the organization of supply chains of fresh vegetables in the Kenyan horticulture industry, focusing on the supply chain relationships and practices among exporters and smallholder farmers. In so doing, I seek to highlight the often-contested nature of the implementation of standards in social fields that are marked by different and distributed principles of evaluating quality, production processes, and legitimate actions in the marketplace. I also reconstruct the challenges and opportunities that exporters and farmers are facing with regard to the implementation of and compliance with standards. Finally, I elaborate on the scope for action that producers and policymakers have under these structures to retain sectoral competitiveness in a global economy of qualities.

T1  - A spot of coffee in crisis: Nicaraguan smallholder cooperatives, fair trade networks, and gendered empowerment
AN  - 743811546; 3975305
AB  - Comparison of responses to the post-1999 coffee crisis of three smallholder cooperatives participating in Fair Trade and conventional commodity networks suggests that agrarian-reform histories, gender relations, and bottom-up organizing practices influenced members' sense of empowerment. Although most small-scale farmers suffered a decline in their sense of empowerment, the Fair Trade cooperatives found opportunity in the midst of the crisis. In addition to documenting North-South inequalities, this research reveals the uneven gender relationships within producer cooperatives, finds the lowest empowerment levels in a cooperative connected only with conventional coffee trade networks, and chronicles the achievements of a women's Fair Trade cooperative.

T1  - Biofuels, poverty, and growth: a computable general equilibrium analysis of Mozambique
AN  - 58823165; 2010-490305
AB  - This paper assesses the implications of large-scale investments in biofuels for growth and income distribution. We find that biofuels investment enhances growth and poverty reduction despite some displacement of food crops by biofuels. Overall, the biofuel investment trajectory analyzed increases Mozambique's annual economic growth by 0.6 percentage points and reduces the incidence of poverty by about 6 percentage points over a 12-year phase-in period. Benefits depend on production technology. An outgrower approach to producing biofuels is more pro-poor, due to the greater use of unskilled labor and accrual of land rents to smallholders, compared with the more capital-intensive plantation approach. Moreover, the benefits of outgrower schemes are enhanced if they result in technology spillovers to other crops. These results should not be taken as a green light for unrestrained biofuels development. Rather, they indicate that a carefully designed and managed biofuels policy holds the potential for substantial gains. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Learning to voice? Evolving roles of family farmers in the coordination of large-scale irrigation schemes in Morocco
AN  - 1151963754
AB  - In Morocco, large-scale irrigation schemes have evolved over the past twenty years from the centralised management of irrigation and agricultural production into more complex multi-actor systems. This study analysed whether, and how, in the context of state withdrawal, increased farmer autonomy and political liberalisation, family farmers currently participate in the coordination and negotiation of issues that affect them and involve scheme-level organisations. Issues related to water management, the sugar industry and the dairy sector were analysed in five large-scale irrigation schemes. Farmer organisations that were set up to intervene in water management and sugar production were seen to be either inactive or to have weak links with their constituency; hence, the irrigation administration and the sugar industry continue to interact directly with farmers in a centralised way. Given their inability to voice their interests, when farmers have the opportunity, many choose exit strategies, for instance by resorting to the use of groundwater. In contrast, many community-based milk collection cooperatives were seen to function as accountable intermediaries between smallholders and dairy firms. While, as in the past, family farmers are still generally not involved in decision making at scheme level, in the milk collection cooperatives studied, farmers learn to coordinate and negotiate for the development of their communities.

T1  - Why Don't Pesticide Applicators Protect Themselves? Exploring the Use of Personal Protective Equipment among Colombian Smallholders
AN  - 215552107; 20166315
AB  - The misuse of personal protective equipment (PPE) during pesticide application was investigated among smallholders in Colombia. The integrative agent-centered (IAG) framework and a logistic regression approach were adopted. The results suggest that the descriptive social norm was significantly influencing PPE use. The following were also important: (1) having experienced pesticide-related health problems; (2) age; (3) the share of pesticide application carried out; and (4) the perception of PPE hindering work. Interestingly, the influence of these factors differed for different pieces of PPE. Since conformity to the social norm is a source of rigidity in the system, behavioral change may take the form of a discontinuous transition. In conclusion, five suggestions for triggering a transition towards more sustainable PPE use are formulated: (1) diversifying targets/tools; (2) addressing structural aspects; (3) sustaining interventions in the long-term; (4) targeting farmers' learning-by-experience; and (5) targeting PPE use on a collective level.

T1  - From plantations to smallholder production: the role of policy in the reorganization of the Sri Lankan tea sector
AN  - 37227868; 3909645
AB  - The Sri Lankan tea sector has changed from one dominated by vertically integrated plantations to one where independent processors of black tea purchase their input (green leaf tea) from small, independent growers. This paper provides a unifying conceptual framework to characterize three major factors affecting the changes in vertical coordination arrangements (transaction, production, and management costs). Regulation and government policy have altered these determinants of organizational change. Transaction costs have been reduced by state intervention into the price for green leaf which subsequently lowered the risk of processors re-negotiating prices downward. Production costs, which continue to be dominated by labor expenses due to the lack of technological developments for harvesting, have increased more for plantations than independent producers due to union pressures.

T1  - Collaborative market development as a propoor and pro-environmental strategy
AN  - 815277963; 4134468
AB  - Litchi growers of the Hmong ethnic minority in hillsides of northern Thailand have received consistently low prices for their fresh litchi fruits in past years. Concerns over sustainable livelihoods and land use have prompted a group of academics from University of Hohenheim, Germany, and two institutes from Chiang Mai University, Thailand, to collaborate and invite farmers to initiate talks with a large supermarket chain that aims to buy directly from growers, thus bypassing middlemen and guaranteeing higher prices. The prospect of higher financial benefits has incited a group of farmers from several villages to comply with Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) guidelines, reduce the use of hazardous agrochemicals, form a cooperative and adapt cultivation methods. Drawing on qualitative research methods and an action-research approach, this pilot case study provides key insights into how collaboration between academics, smallholder farmers and large business actors can be fostered towards market relationships that are economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.

T1  - Institutional and governance factors influencing the performance of selected smallholder agricultural cooperatives in KwaZulu-Natal
AN  - 753832097; 3987302
AB  - This paper evaluates the impact of institutional and governance factors on the performance of 10 smallholder agricultural cooperatives in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). Five of the cooperatives grow and market vegetables, three produce and market poultry, one is a beef production cooperative and another operates a bakery. The results of a cluster analysis suggest that the performance of the selected smallholder cooperatives is influenced by institutional and governance problems. Institutional problems give rise to low levels of equity and debt capital, reliance on government funding, low levels of investment, and subsequent loss of members. Governance problems are strongly linked to the absence of secret ballot, low levels of education, lack of production and management skills training, weak marketing arrangements and consequent low returns to members as patrons or investors. The conclusion is that appropriate institutional arrangements and good governance are important to the performance of enterprises initiated by groups of smallholders. South Africa's new Cooperatives Act prevents smallholder cooperatives from adopting good institutional arrangements. Alternative ownership structures such as close corporations and private companies offer better institutional arrangements and opportunities for equity-sharing partnerships.

T1  - Equal Numbers, Equal Chances? A Case Study of Gender Differences in the Distribution of Social Capital in Smallholder Farmer Groups in Búzi District, Mozambique
AN  - 215616155
AB  - Despite the potential for local groups to contribute to rural development, it remains questionable whether social capital - as the 'missing link' in development - is compatible with the idea of gender equity strived for in 'gender mainstreamed' development projects. This paper examines engendered differences in smallholder farmer groups in Búzi district, and how social capital is generated and distributed. Although men and women equally invest in groups, in terms of participation in group activities or contribution of communal work, the benefits of social capital are significantly unequally distributed. Women find it harder to transform the number of social relations into improved information, access to markets or help in case of need. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Incentives, supervision, and sharecropper productivity
AN  - 37133383; 3862166
AB  - Though sharecropping remains widespread, its determinants are still poorly understood and the debate over the extent of moral hazard is far from settled. We address both issues by analyzing the role of landlord supervision. When landlords vary in their cost of supervision, otherwise identical share-tenants can have different productivity. Unique data on monitoring frequency collected from share-tenants in rural Pakistan confirms that, controlling for selection, 'supervised' tenants are significantly more productive than 'unsupervised' ones. Also, landlords' decisions regarding monitoring and incentives offered to tenants depend importantly on the cost of supervision. All rights reserved, Elsevier

T1  - Sustaining linkages to high value markets through collective action in Uganda
AN  - 872588057
AB  - Uganda's rapid urbanization offers new market opportunities for smallholder farmers to supply higher value markets such as supermarket chains and fast-food restaurants. Supplying these formal outlets offers higher incomes but accessing and maintaining links to these markets requires significant upgrading in terms of product quality and business management. To meet these conditions farmers need to become more organized which requires increased levels of social capital, to strengthen internal and external relations with group members, service providers and market chain actors. One farmers' group in south-western Uganda has successfully sustained sales of potatoes to a fast-food outlet in Kampala. Farmers had to learn a series of new skills and integrate multiple technical, organizational, financial and marketing innovations. This paper outlines how collective action combined with strong leadership and an iterative market-led learning process enabled a smallholder farmers' association to meet the considerable challenges of achieving the stringent quality parameters of a modern food outlet.

AN  - 872585843
AB  - This paper examines the notion of inclusiveness in rural producer organizations (RPOs) and the extent to which such RPOs can be used to reach the rural poor in sub-Saharan Africa. Using farmer cooperatives in Ethiopia as a case in point, the paper examines the role of RPOs in supporting smallholder commercialization, and the extent to which principles of an inclusive, bottom-up approach relate to their marketing performance. Based on a combination of nationally-representative household- and cooperative-level survey data, we find that poorer farmers tend not to participate in these organizations although they may indirectly benefit from them. When they do participate, they are often excluded from decision-making processes. Finally, we investigate the relationship between marketing performance and inclusiveness and uncover evidence of significant tradeoffs between them. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Collective action initiatives to improve marketing performance: Lessons from farmer groups in Tanzania
AN  - 872585812
AB  - This study aims to examine the extent to which certain characteristics and asset endowments of smallholder farmer groups facilitate collective action initiatives to improve group marketing performance. This is approached through an evaluation of a government-led programme in Tanzania, which is attempting to increase smallholder farmers' incomes and food security through a market-oriented intervention. Findings suggest that more mature groups with strong internal institutions, functioning group activities, and a good asset base of natural capital are more likely to improve their market situation. Gender composition of groups also affects group marketing performance, as an enabling factor for male-dominated groups. Structural social capital in the form of membership in other groups and ties to external service providers, and cognitive social capital in the form of intra-group trust and altruistic behaviour are not significant factors in a group's ability to improve its market situation.

T1  - Sharecropping, Insecure Land Rights and Land Titling Policies: A Case Study of Lac Alaotra, Madagascar
AN  - 58808607; 2008-256745
AB  - Sharecropping between poor landlords and rich tenants has hitherto been the subject of very little academic scrutiny. Given that such 'reverse share tenancy' contracts are mostly at odds with the canonical risk-sharing explanation for sharecropping, this article discusses a rationale for them that relies on weak property rights as well as the legal doctrine of adverse possession, and tests it using data from Lac Alaotra, Madagascar, where this type of tenancy accounts for one-third of land rentals. The empirical findings are discussed in relation to recent land-reform policies by the Government of Madagascar, the World Bank, IFAD, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation.

T1  - Trade, Standards, and Poverty: Evidence from Senegal
AN  - 229546721
AB  - In the debate on trade and poverty it is argued that standards act as trade barriers and cause marginalization of the poor. This paper quantifies income and poverty effects of high-standards trade and integrates labor market effects, by using company and household survey data from the vegetable export chain in Senegal. We find that exports grew sharply despite increasing standards, contributing importantly to rural incomes and poverty reduction. Tightening standards induced a shift from smallholder contract farming to integrated estate production, altering the mechanism through which poor households benefit: through labor markets instead of product markets.

T1  - Contractual arrangements and enforcement in transition agriculture: theory and evidence from China
AN  - 37124904; 3860647
AB  - This paper empirically investigates the relationship between contractual arrangements and their enforcement in Chinese agriculture. Based on an analysis of a survey of 100 agribusiness firms engaged in contract farming in Zhejiang province of China, we find that private contract enforcement mechanisms play an important role in influencing smallholders' decisions to breach or fulfill contracts. Contract arrangements such as floor pricing, or requiring smallholders to make specific investments facilitate self-enforcement and significantly improve the smallholder's contract fulfillment rate. This is particularly important in Chinese agriculture since the business environment is characterized by an absence of effective public enforcement institutions. All rights reserved, Elsevier

T1  - Assessing the Functioning of Land Rental Markets in Ethiopia
AN  - 236521280
AB  - In this article, the researchers use a large panel data set from Ethiopia that contains a substantial share of cultivating households' owned and sharecropped land simultaneously; in addition, the data set is more detailed and larger than what had been available in other studies. To assess the efficiency of sharecropping as a key contractual arrangement in land markets, the researchers estimate a production function and input demand functions using household fixed effects. Results suggest that input and output intensities are indeed statistically significantly lower on sharecropped than on owned plots, thus leading us to reject the hypothesis that tenure status does not affect producers' decisions and that sharecropping contracts are not affected by Marshallian inefficiency, though the level of inefficiency is much lower than that found elsewhere in the literature.

T1  - Evidence on the Incentive Properties of Share Contracts
AN  - 196397189
AB  - Ever since Adam Smith, share contracts have been condemned for their lack of incentives. Sharecropping tenants face incentives to undersupply productive inputs since they receive only a fraction of the marginal revenue. The empirical literature reports that lands under sharecropping are indeed less productive and employ inputs less intensively than those operated by owners. This paper shows that (1) sharecropping and fixed-rent tenancy are both associated with low-quality lands, (2) plots under sharecropping and fixed rent present (on average) the same unconditional productivity, (3) controlling for observed land quality and input use, their average productivities are also identical to those of owner-operated plots, and (4) the input choices satisfy the same profit maximization conditions for all land contracts. These results challenge the conventional wisdom connecting sharecropping to incentive distortions. They support an alternative view that farmers optimally employ more input resources into good-quality lands, which are typically managed by owners. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The value of guanxi for small vegetable farmers in China
AN  - 225141156
AB  - Purpose - Following a guanxi value - buyer-seller relationship quality - marketing behaviour scheme, this paper aims to explore how traditional guanxi supports small vegetable farmers in modern markets in China. Design/methodology/approach - Fieldwork was performed in Jiangsu Province, PR China. A stratified random sample of 167 vegetable farmers provided data for empirical testing with partial least squares analysis. Findings - The findings suggested that the value of guanxi networks is an antecedent to buyer-seller relationship quality and marketing behaviour in China. Guanxi networks improve the quality of buyer-seller relationships in terms of interpersonal trust and satisfaction. Buyer-seller relationships influence smallholders' transaction relationships, their participation in modern markets and choice for formal contracts. Guanxi networks not only support Chinese small-scale vegetable farmers to get access to modern high-value markets (e.g. supermarkets and international markets), but also encourage informal transactions in the vegetable business. Practical implications - Guanxi networks play a critical role in the modern marketing environment in China. Marketing strategies based on personal relationships should be further enhanced in order to increase participation of smallholders in modern markets. Originality/value - Quantitative evaluation of the effects of the Chinese cultural embedded concept of guanxi in the Chinese agrifood sector fills in an important research gap. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Natural Resource Management: Historical Lessons from Indonesia
AN  - 61706996; 200819485
AB  - This paper uses a variety of historical evidence from Indonesia to explore the conditions for sustainable management of natural resources. In the agricultural sphere, history gives reason for optimism regarding the ability of individuals to conserve and improve soil resources on an uncoordinated, anarchic basis under systems of intensive smallholder farming and agroforestry. It also suggests that this ability may be enhanced, rather than eroded, both by population growth and by the commercialization of agriculture. When it comes to the management of forests and fisheries and the conservation of nature, by contrast, there is less reason for optimism. If sustainable solutions are to be found in these spheres, the historical evidence suggests that they will involve political hierarchy, and will depend on the honouring of a social contract in which the state serves the public interest while retaining the powers of coercion which it needs in order to do just that.

T1  - Smallholders and the 'Household Responsibility System': Adapting to Institutional Change in Chinese Agriculture
AN  - 61667986; 200819494
AB  - During the last quarter century, China's agricultural sector has undergone a dramatic transformation from collective to private production under the so-called 'Household Responsibility System.' This incentive system, designed to increase yields, reallocated communal land to peasant households, creating hundreds of millions of smallholders with relative autonomy over land use decisions and crop selection. Based on recent ethnographic research, this paper discusses the smallholder farming system of a mixed-ethnic community that intensively cultivates small land plots for subsistence and market exchange in China's populous southwestern province of Sichuan. The paper characterizes the smallholder system in terms of biodiversity of plant and animal species, market distribution of crops, multiple cropping systems, and labor and technology inputs. The paper also describes how smallholders adapt their agricultural practices and decisions to changing market conditions and agricultural policies. Significantly, these adaptive strategies focus on shifting to the production of various cash crops, including melons and mangoes. Implications for the long-term viability of China's smallholders, particularly in ecologically and economically marginal areas, are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - African Rural Livelihoods under Stress: Economic Liberalization and Smallholder Farmers in Malawi
AN  - 212481899
AB  - Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world. Its gross domestic income per capita in 2005 was only US$160, ranking it at 202nd among the 206 countries where statistics were available. This book is about the livelihood strategies adopted by the Malawian rural population to cope with its difficult conditions. The analysis adopts a microlevel perspective by focusing on each rural household as an analytical unit. Information is drawn from detailed case studies of six villages in various parts of rural Malawi. The detailed micro-level case studies are also linked to wider macro-level factors such as increasing population pressure on the land, historical evolution of government policies, and the formal and informal institutions that mediate the rural population's access to productive resources and markets. The purpose of this study is threefold. The first is to clarify the effects of government policies on the livelihoods of smallholder producers. The second is to examine the diversity in livelihood strategies and the disparities among smallholders. The third purpose is to find some common features in the livelihoods of smallholder households across different locations in Malawi.

T1  - Constraints on smallholder market oriented dairy systems in the north eastern coastal region of Tanzania
AN  - 274682137; 18265872
AB  - Issue Title: The Use of Participatory Approaches for Identifying and Prioritizing the Constraints to Productivity on Small-scale Market-oriented Dairy Systems

              
Twenty five smallholder dairy farmers and other stakeholders, through a Participatory Rural Appraisal in three wards of the Tanga township of north east coastal Tanzania, ranked their perceived constraints in descending order of importance: Low milk price and marketing, feed shortage in the dry season, poor management, low animal productivity, poor reproductive performance and diseases. Tick borne diseases were reported on a majority of farms. An Economic Opportunity Survey revealed wide ranges in management indices and improvement in annual milk production, age at first calving and lactation length to represent the best potential for gain. Performance generally was below locally set targets. Farmers spent on average in the three wards between 39% and 77% of income from milk on feed costs yearly. Interventions were instituted emphasising those that farmers could afford immediately. They included farmer training, dry season feed supplementation, tick control, improvement of animal shed/house cleanliness and the formation of a cooperative for milk marketing. Partial budgeting is being used to monitor success. Follow-up meetings and regular visits to farms by field officers are disseminating information on outcomes to encourage farmers to continue with interventions and spread useful knowledge to friends and neighbours.

T1  - Reverse leasing and power dynamics among blue agave farmers in western Mexico
AN  - 214182829
AB  - We examine changing production relations in the Mexican tequila industry to explore the ways in which large industrial firms are using "reverse leasing arrangements," a form of contract farming, to extend their control over small agave farmers. Under these arrangements, smallholders rent their parcels to contracting companies who bring in capital, machinery, labor, and other agricultural inputs. Smallholders do not have access to their land, nor do they make any of the management decisions. We analyze the factors that have led some producers to participate in reverse leasing arrangements, while allowing other producers to continue farming independently. In addition, we look at the ways in which farmers are responding to these new production relations and constraints and the strategies that they are using to regain control over the production process.

T1  - Agricultural Development, Contract Farming and Ghana's Oil Palm Industry
AN  - 194754959
AB  - This article traces the development of the oil palm industry in Ghana and its contribution to agricultural development. Drawing on the example of the Ghana Oil Palm Development Corporation (GOPDC) and its outgrower scheme, it argues that the shift from state-sponsored to market-led development has had important ramifications for agricultural development. From its origin as a state-owned firm, GOPDC has gradually transformed itself into a market-driven firm as Ghana took on the broader principles of neoliberalism in the 1990s. The privatised GOPDC, while still addressing some of the challenges inherited from the past, has developed a strong relationship with its outgrowers and, as a result, has become more successful in economic terms. While privatisation and liberalisation are not without problems, the positive effects of this increasingly successful oil palm outgrower scheme have, in general, benefited not only the scheme's outgrowers, but also the 12 communities in which they live.

T1  - Integration of smallholder wetland aquaculture-agriculture systems (fingerponds) into riparian farming systems on the shores of Lake Victoria, Kenya: socio-economics and livelihoods
AN  - 231503916
AB  - This paper presents the results of experimental fingerponds: an integrated flood recession aquaculture-agriculture production system in the Lake Victoria wetlands in Kenya. The overall aim of the study is to assess the potential of fingerponds as a sustainable wetland farming system for improving food security at the subsistence level and within the context of the existing livelihood activities. The contribution of this new activity to rural household livelihoods is evaluated. Since it is a sustainable technology, based on natural events, the production level is intermediate and the benefits may not be high in the short term. Economic analysis shows that the gross margin and net income of fingerponds is about 752 and 197 Euros per hectare per year, respectively. This is about an 11% increase in the annual gross margin of an average rural household around Lake Victoria. The additional per capita fish supply is 3 kg per season or more from a 192 m^sup 2^ pond. The potential fish protein supply of 200 kg/ha is high compared with most existing terrestrial protein production systems. Fingerponds have the potential to contribute to household food security and to improve livelihoods. Sensitivity analysis indicates that biophysical variations, which may occur from one wetland to another, have implications for the functioning, and consequently the economic performance, of fingerponds. This reinforces the need for the integration of these systems into other household activities to buffer the household against potential risk. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Moral hazard and Marshallian inefficiency: Evidence from Tunisia
AN  - 36589148; 3387682
AB  - We formalize the link between optimal cost-sharing contracts and the production technology in the presence of moral hazard by appealing to several well-known results from duality theory. Building on intuitions from the interlinkage literature, we show that optimal contractual structure is determined by the (i) substitution possibilities that exist between different observable factor inputs, as well as (ii) between these inputs and unobservable effort. We endogenize contractual choice using landlord characteristics as instruments, exploiting the fact that, in our dataset, landlords interact with several tenants and vice versa. The approach is applied to an unbalanced plot-level panel of cost-sharing contracts in a Tunisian village, using a translog representation of the restricted profit function. Contractual terms are found to be a significant determinant of input use and therefore lead to Marshallian inefficiency, while the optimality of the underlying contractual structure is rejected.

T1  - Bargaining power and revenue distribution in the Costa Rican mango supply chain: a gaming simulation approach with local producers
AN  - 1658410741
AB  - By the time a European consumer eats a Costa Rican mango, the product has been traded in several transactions between producers, traders, retailers and consumers. This paper investigates the position of Costa Rican smallholders in the mango supply chain in terms of bargaining power and revenue distribution. It examines data derived using a specially developed research tool: the Mango Chain Game (MCG), a gaming simulation that mimics the negotiation conditions in the Costa Rican mango supply chain. The MCG defines roles for all agents in the chain and records transaction attributes. Five sessions with the MCG were played with different groups of mango producers, resulting in a data set of 82 transactions and 43 bargaining power positions. Bargaining power was assessed at a 10-point Likert scale. Revenue distribution was measured in terms of value added. The results show that self-perceived bargaining power was dependent on negotiation skills, wealth and good partnership of the negotiators, but independent of market imperfections. Revenue distribution was related to the bargaining power of the trading partner, risk perception and the duration of the contract. Conclusions include that using a gaming simulation as data source can help identify less tangible issues in supply chain research, which is a new field of application for gaming simulations. Agency cooperation, skills and being able to bear risks play a role for improving the efficiency of the mango supply chain in Costa Rica as seen from a producers' perspective. The gaming results indicate that initiatives for improving the bargaining power of producers are more promising if they focus on improving skills and relations in trade rather than on solving market imperfections.

T1  - Agricultural cooperatives II: can they facilitate access of small-scale farmers in South Africa to input and product markets?
AN  - 36846358; 3523638
AB  - The objective of this research is to investigate whether agricultural cooperatives can facilitate smallholder farmer access to input and product markets. Farmers in two case study communal areas of KwaZulu-Natal face high transaction costs as reflected primarily in their low levels of education and literacy, lack of market information, insecure property rights, poor road and communication infrastructure, and long long distances to markets. Analysis of the reasons why cooperatives were originally established in various parts of the world suggests that most of the causes (such as poverty, market failure and high transaction costs) also apply to the study farmers, as do the seven international principles of cooperation. Smallholder farmers in both case study regions have the potential to grow high-value crops such as vegetables, fruit and cut flowers. In the supply chain from farm to market, the optimum boundary for each organization involved in the chain (e.g. cooperative and investor-oriented firm) depends on the minimum operational and transaction costs for each business.

T1  - The Legal Status of Tenants and Sharecroppers in Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century France and Ottoman Syria
AN  - 211164693
AB  - By the middle of the sixteenth century, the role of the tenant farmer and sharecropper in both Syria and France witnessed important transformations which lent increasing relevance to the social and legal status enjoyed by these cultivators. In various regions of France after the sixteenth century, a rising class of bourgeois landholders increasingly appropriated agricultural lands from both peasant proprietors and nobles, leading to the spread of both sharecropping and leasing contracts. In Ottoman Syria, the appropriation of peasant lands and proliferation of tenancy arrangements was linked to an expanding state which sought to consolidate power and ensure the consistent flow of revenue. Thus, this paper will address how the socio-legal discourse on tenants and sharecroppers differed in a context where arable lands were appropriated by private rather than public forces. Issues that are examined include: perceptions of agricultural innovation; possession rights; and payment of rent and other dues.

              
While Islamic legal scholars articulated a discourse which sought to incorporate tenants and sharecroppers, French legal and social thinkers of the day championed the rights of the landlord above all else. Unlike their Syrian counterparts, French thinkers linked agricultural development and efficient production to private ownership of land. In Syria, on the other hand, jurists advocated a land tenure system in which the possession rights of cultivators were supported while landlord interests were not jeopardised. Thus, agricultural development in the Syrian case was articulated within a framework which conceded multiple layers of ownership. These ideas would have an important impact on nineteenth-century developments in both regions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A conceptual analysis of relational contracts in agribusiness supply chains: the case of the sugar industry in Swaziland
AN  - 36739269; 3465404
AB  - This study examines the nature of the relationship between cane growers and millers and how it affects cane growers' perceptions of the value added in the sugar supply chain. Drawing from relational exchange theory, the study utilised the perceptions of 124 smallhoder cane growers in the Swaziland sugar industry. Factors measured in terms of a likert type scale were used to measure each relational construct within the miller-grower contract relationship. The unpacks the trust relationship between large agribusiness companies and smallholder out growers, and shows that relationships characterised by social factors like trust, commitment, and cooperation enhance mutual benefit and quality relationships between parties. This study found that farmers perceive an element of opportunistic behaviour and a lack of cooperation by millers and therefore have limited trust in the millers. Consequently it was also found that satisfaction by cane growers on their relationship with millers has a positive relationship with their level of trust, level of commitment, relative dependence, perception of opportunistic behaviour by millers and perceived cooperation between themselves and the millers. The results point to a number of aspects both growers and millers need to attend to which could contribute to improved relationship and in turn efficiency and returns in the sugar industry in Swaziland.

T1  - Smallholder Cotton Production In Tanzania: Emerging Issues On Accountability In Kilosa District, Morogoro
AN  - 61665420; 200726749
AB  - Traditional cash crop production in Tanzania has been declining with time. While some natural, infrastructure and marketing factors have been known to contribute to low agricultural productivity, reasons related to accountability on the part of officials managing different organs have been little known. This paper discusses emerging accountability issues on the part of government and other service providing institutions as far as cotton production in Kilosa District and more specifically in Malui Village is concerned. A cross-sectional research design that allows collection of information at one point in time was adopted covering several cases. Data for the study were collected through interviews of key informants and farmers, physical observations, documentation and meeting with village government. The emerging findings show that limited access of smallholders to sufficient and fertile land, appropriate farm inputs and reliable markets due to lack of effective accountability on the part of local government, cotton board, cooperatives and private traders has been among the responsible factors for the declining production of cotton. Establishing the right structures and enforcement mechanisms for accountability can disentangle smallholder agriculture from persistent, chronic dissatisfactions of farmers.

T1  - The role of social distance in sharecropping efficiency
AN  - 1400826611; 4247058
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding of the role of culture in general, and social distance in particular, in influencing the choice and efficiency of various contractual modes in developing country agriculture. It aims to focus on sharecropping, but the model of social distance can be applied to any contract, mainly those in close-knit village societies. Principal components analysis (PCA) is used in the study to develop a social distance index for all sharecroppers, which is included as an independent variable in land productivity ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. Findings indicate social distance is a key determinant in sharecropping efficiency for marginal tenant farmers in rural Nepal. Specifically, social distance is found to be a significant factor in explaining land productivity differentials between owned land and sharecropped land. From a policy standpoint, the results suggest that a relatively egalitarian agrarian structure, insofar as it results in lower social distances among parties to land and labor contracts, would have a positive impact on productivity. Therefore, the object of agrarian reforms should not be to alter or constrain the form of contracts (for example by banning sharecropping) but rather to improve the social relations among contracting parties.

T1  - Pluralism, Poverty and Sharecropping: Cultivating Open-Mindedness in Development Studies
AN  - 61629260; 200712380
AB  - Pluralism adds depth to the mixing of methods in development studies. Global society has both structure and complexity, and agents within society actively promote competing, ways of describing and interpreting that society. Theoretical pluralism offers a way for social scientists to describe and judge the competing theories about a given social situation (Methodological pluralism is also discussed in this paper.) An example - tenancy in India - is explored to illustrate how pluralists compare theories. The tenancy literature includes neoclassical, institutionalist, and Marxist theories. These cut across three academic disciplines Pluralist research is often interdisciplinary in such ways. Such interdisciplinary research generates a dialogue across epistemological chasms and across theories that have different underlying assumptions. Pluralist research can be valued for its discursive bridging function. Pluralist research can also contribute to improvements in scientific measurement. Divergen schools of thought can be brought into contact by reconceptualising the objects of research, such as contracts or coercion. In the tenancy literature, alternative ways of measuring and interpreting, power arose. Structuralist approaches tended to assume poverty and inequality as part of the context within which economic action takes place. Strengths and weaknesses of such assumptions are examined. The approach recommended here, which is realist, makes possible an improved dialogue about policy changes aimed at poverty reduction. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Pluralism, poverty and sharecropping: Cultivating open-mindedness in development studies
AN  - 220612595
AB  - Pluralism adds depth to the mixing of methods in development studies. Global society has both structure and complexity, and agents within society actively promote competing ways of describing and interpreting that society. Theoretical pluralism offers a way for social scientists to describe and judge the competing theories about a given social situation. (Methodological pluralism is also discussed in this paper.) An example--tenancy in India--is explored to illustrate how pluralists compare theories. The tenancy literature includes neoclassical, institutionalist, and Marxist theories. These cut across three academic disciplines. Pluralist research is often interdisciplinary in such ways. Such interdisciplinary research generates a dialogue across epistemological chasms and across theories that have different underlying assumptions. Pluralist research can be valued for its discursive bridging function. Pluralist research can also contribute to improvements in scientific measurement. Divergent schools of thought can be brought into contact by reconceptualising the objects of research, such as contracts or coercion. In the tenancy literature, alternative ways of measuring and interpreting power arose. Structuralist approaches tended to assume poverty and inequality as part of the context within which economic action takes place. Strengths and weaknesses of such assumptions are examined. The approach recommended here, which is realist, makes possible an improved dialogue about policy changes aimed at poverty reduction. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Private agricultural colonization on a Brazilian frontier, 1970-1980
AN  - 215900188
AB  - Private colonization is the use of companies and cooperatives to survey, demarcate and occupy land, build infrastructure, open roads, plan urban areas, and provide health services and education. Although state-directed colonization projects are strongly implicated in recent environmental and social changes in the Brazilian Amazon, areas settled by private colonization were larger than state-led settlement. The paper considers this poorly examined aspect of the region's recent settlement history by focusing upon a colonization cooperative and private company that settled smallholders from southern Brazil to eastern Mato Grosso State between 1970 and 1980. The analysis emphasizes how private colonization cooperatives successfully secured land title, setting the stage for subsequent commercial agricultural development. This study rejects prevailing interpretations of private colonization as a tool of authoritarian government in Brazil. Rather, private colonization secured land tenure and organized an economically viable production system in a frontier environment of unpredictable state bureaucracies, high transaction costs, risk, and precarious markets.

T1  - COLLECTIVE ACTION IN SMALLHOLDER ORGANIC FARMING: A STUDY OF THE EZEMVELO FARMERS' ORGANIZATION IN KWAZULU-NATAL
AN  - 203180964
AB  - This study analyses the Ezemvelo Farmers' Organisation (EFO), a certified organic smallholder group in KwaZulu-Natal province (South Africa), as an institution to improve smallholder access to a niche market by reducing unit production and transaction costs in the supply chain. Using a multinomial logit model, results suggest that EFO is more likely to survive if it continues to secure fully subsidised information, transport, fencing, and certification services for its members, and if it improves the benefits of participating by synchronising harvest and delivery dates, negotiating price discounts for organic inputs, and by maintaining an office with telephone, fax and postal services.

T1  - Research works in Ethiopia
AN  - 200001564
AB  - Today, the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR) advocates integrated agricultural research for development. This involves partnerships between stakeholders at every stage of the research process: marketing is considered crucial from the start. The haricot bean is poorly managed by Ethiopian farmers despite the fact that exports bring in nearly US$10.5 million annually. EIAR has developed bean varieties of commercially acceptable quality; it has also recommended improved management practices such as ploughing two to three times a year, planting in rows and weeding as necessary. These were tested on 700 plots in three woredas (districts) in the Rift Valley in partnership with all stakeholders. Clearly, innovative agricultural research and strong partnerships can improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and contribute towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals of ensuring food security and poverty reduction.

T1  - Cottage sugar industries as alternatives for meeting Nigeria's domestic sugar demands
AN  - 36501598; 3321416
AB  - The sugar industry in Nigeria has failed to meet the domestic sugar consumption demands of the country. The combined production figure of the two major sugar companies at Bacita and Numan stands at less than 1% of the requirement. Inconsistent government policies, uncontrolled sugar imports and the capital-intensive nature of large-scale sugar production could all account for this inadequate production level. The National Cereals Research Institute (NCRI) has developed a 10 tonnes of cane per day (tcd) mini brown sugar plant suitable for cottage level sugar production to complement the large-scale plants' efforts. Outgrower schemes currently operated by the Nigerian Sugar Company, Bacita and the Savannah Sugar Company, Numan are potential sources of the raw materials needed by these cottage industries when established in all the sugar cane-growing communities of Nigeria. Newly opened up farm areas of up to 100,000 ha will also provide canes for the plants. This paper presents some of the problems militating against profitable sugar production by large-scale sugar plants in Nigeria. It also highlights areas of cooperation and support by policy makers and other stakeholders in the sugar industry for increased domestic sugar production. This will facilitate the attainment of domestic sugar self-sufficiency, rural industrialization, social and food security. Reprinted by permission of IP Publishing Ltd

T1  - Benevolent Intent? The Development Encounter in Kenya's Horticulture Industry
AN  - 59996853; 200612205
AB  - This article examines the trajectory of development policy & practice through the case of the Kenyan export trade of fresh produce. It traces how African labor, particularly women's labor, has been harnessed & restructured by three models of development: (1) the neoliberal prescriptions for agricultural diversification & contract farming; (2) the post-Washington consensus of pro-poor growth; & (3) the Corporate Social Responsibility movement of the late 20th century. While each model offers different approaches to improving Kenyan lives, they are united by a common intent to bring African labor into the fold of modernity, as both object & instrument of development. Drawing on fieldwork conducted among smallholders & waged employees, the article advances two arguments: (1) the construction & outcome of horticulture development is founded on, & contingent upon, gendered forms of labor; & (2) the exercise of trusteeship has been central to each model as international financial agencies & non-governmental organizations steward the 'development' of the African laborer. The article contends that all models cast the Kenyan worker as someone to be developed, be it through rural development, integration into a global workforce, or incorporation into a universal system of social justice.

T1  - Certified Organic Agriculture in Mexico: Market Connections and Certification Practices in Large and Small Producers
AN  - 62152362; EJ724353
AB  - Certification within organic agriculture exhibits flexibility with respect to practices used to demonstrate that a product meets published quality standards. This case study of Mexican certified-organic agriculture finds two forms. Indigenous smallholders of southern Mexico undertake a low-input, process-oriented organic farming in which certification is based upon extensive document review, group inspections, and assessment of on-farm capacity to produce organic inputs. More recently, northern Mexican large agribusiness producers have implemented certifications based upon laboratory testing and assessment of purchased inputs. To specify these differences, this article examines large and small producers in Mexico's organic agriculture sector based on a diagnostic census of Mexican organic agriculture in 668 production zones and field surveys in 256 production zones in which 28 indicators were analyzed. After comparing the organic cultivation and certification practices of large, agro-industrial, input-oriented private firms versus small, cooperatively organized, indigenous and peasant groups, we analyze the implications of this duality for certification frameworks. We argue (with Raynolds, L., 2004. The globalization of organic agro-food networks. World Development 32(5), 725-743; Gonzalez A.A., and Nigh, R., 2005. Smallholder participation and certification of organic farm products in Mexico. Journal of Rural Studies; DeLind, L., 2000. Transforming organic agriculture into industrial organic products: reconsidering national organic standards. Human Organization 59(2), 198-208) that the increasing bureaucratic requirements of international organic certification privilege large farmers and agribusiness-style organic cultivation and present the possibility of a new entrenchment of socio-spatial inequality in Mexico. While organic and fair trade agriculture has been touted as an income-generating production strategy for small producers of the Global South, our study suggests that Mexican organic agriculture reproduces existing social inequalities between large and small producers in conventional Mexican agriculture.

T1  - Grafting keeps farmer in the export market
AN  - 200037126
AB  - Some smallholders are using their own knowledge and innovations to keep up with the market. One such farmer is Aubrey Billet, aged 78. The oil crisis in the late 1970s, the closure of the railway station, political problems and the decline in value of the South African Rand led to the almost complete demise of deciduous fruit production by smallholders. Buying inputs in small quantities was not possible from the local cooperative, which was geared to large-scale farmers. He had learned about grafting while discussing apple production with his large-scale farmer friend. Despite his success with grafting, Billet acknowledges that a newly planted rootstock, with a pre-grafted scion, produces a better yield and fruit quality over a longer period in comparison to one of his "innovative trees" which have about ten years of productive life. It is important that innovations like these are recorded so that farmers elsewhere facing similar circumstances can have access to such knowledge.

T1  - FROM PEASANT TO FARMER: A STUDY OF AGRARIAN TRANSFORMATION IN AN IRANIAN VILLAGE, 1967-2002
AN  - 195601182
AB  - Iranian agriculture and rural society have undergone profound socioeconomic and political changes over the past four decades. While recognizing the significant impact of urbanization, economic development, and integration of the rural economy in the market, this paper contends that the land-reform program of the 1960s and the 1979 revolution represent the primary turning points in the rural transformation. Land reform, through intense state intervention, dramatically changed the traditional landlord-sharecropping system (nizam-i arbab-rayati). Peasant uprisings, the forcible occupation of large estates, and the agrarian policies of the postrevolutionary regime have led to the demise of the urban agricultural bourgeoisie and the empowerment of the peasants. There has been a disintegration of large-scale public and private agricultural production systems, including agribusinesses, farm corporations, and the agricultural production cooperatives developed under the shah's regime.

T1  - What Tanzania's coffee farmers can teach the world: a performance-based look at the fair trade-free trade debate
AN  - 218634232
AB  - Questions remain about the effectiveness of fair trade, especially in comparison with  free trade approaches to development. Both strategies seek to benefit smallholder farmers in lower-income countries, who are vulnerable to declining and fluctuating commodity prices and rising production costs. This study examines two prominent market-based interventions, Fairtrade certification and TechnoServe business development, as they are implemented at two coffee producer organizations in Tanzania.  Qualitative and secondary quantitative data were collected using rapid appraisal methodology during three months of field research. The data were analyzed using the sustainable livelihood framework. This study concludes that both intervention strategies yield potentially valuable results for smallholders in multiple domains, but each is distinctly suited to specific market conditions. Implications of the study's findings are discussed in terms of an emerging consensus on intervention strategies. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Collective action in a complex institutional environment: a case study of small-scale wool growers in South Africa
AN  - 38101470; 2918994
AB  - The importance of social capital and institutional reform is increasingly recognized in current development reporting. This article illustrates the complexity of the institutional environment in which smallholders in developing countries operate and how institutional innovation can contribute to increasing farmers' incomes. A case study of small-scale farmers in the Transkei area of South Africa illustrates the success of new institutional arrangements via a project of the South African wool industry, which aims at improving the livelihoods of farmers by supporting wool production and securing market access. However, possibilities with respect to specialization are limited because of a peculiar institutional environment, in particular a communal land-tenure system.

A transaction cost approach was used to analyse contract participation, total farm gross margins and labour and chemical use. The empirical results suggest: (a) the contract favours farmers with more irrigated land; (b) the contract improved returns to farm capital and was welfare improving; (c) the contract increased the demand for non-family labour, particularly female labour; and (d) the contract increased the intensity of chemical use. The success of the contract was attributed to the nature of the contracting process, which was between Pioneer and grower groups and not individual smallholders.

AN  - 233018524
AB  - Do observed contracts have the properties predicted by the principal-agent model with moral hazard in contract theory? This paper tests the predictions of such an agency model in the context of sharecropping in North India. The most well-known explanation for sharecropping is based on the principal-agent model with a trade-off between risk and incentives. This paper tests for the effect of cultivation technology on the incentive structure of share contracts as predicted by the agency model.

N1  - SuppNotes - Transformations in the global food system are causing changes in food production and marketing in India at a slower rate than elsewhere in the developing world but there is is a growing domestic market for horticultural produce, in both traditional and exotic vegetables. Production and marketing arrangements are responding to changing demand driven by urbanisation and diet change. Government-sponsored schemes in horticulture have mixed results, generating more jobs than cereal production but reaching larger rather than smaller farmers and landless households. Beyond direct government interventions, new forms of contractual and sharecropping relationships are emerging between private dealers and farmers. These could be useful in developing a model for ensuring that the horticulture sector can benefit small and marginal farmers.

T1  - Emerging strategies against poverty the road less traveled
AN  - 203306475
AB  - This is the story of a struggle for survival in the Andes. Ravaged by the excesses of nature and a brutal insurgent conflict, and more recently by inroads made by economic globalization, the Serranos (inhabitants of the Peruvian sierra) face the prospect of ever-increasing poverty and the withering away of their villages and cultural traditions. Worldwide recession, or its threat, simply magnifies the problem. Although there are no permanent solutions, purely local initiatives centering on community-organized and community-operated enterprises have produced some creative approaches. These may offer alternatives and hope to other communities, and they are the focus of this study. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

N1  - SuppNotes - This work deals with the characteristics adopted by, and the role taken on in connection to, share-cropping in agricultural and livestock production with a high level of technological development and firmly integrated into the marketplace, using cases of horticulture and dairy production from the Argentinean pampas region. In both production processes we can see flexible ways of organization and methods of payment for work, which permit these undertakings to adapt themselves to the new demands of the market and production. At present, within the context of modern production processes, we can observe that forms of contracts used in sharecropping can go from a work relationship whose remunation is a percentage to land tenure relationships exclusively; between both extremes one encounters different situations of funding associations and labour in order to effectuate production. Sharecropping is thus presented as a contractual relationship that may include labour contracts as well as contracts with associations. The objective of this work is to compare different cases in order to increase our knowledge about sharecropping in highly modernized contexts.

T1  - Reestructuración y contratos de mediería en la región pampeana argentina
AN  - 208917129
AB  - En esas condiciones la mediería se diferencia de las modalidades más clásicas donde predominan vínculos de corte paternalista en el marco de coerciones extraeconomicas, generándose dos situaciones claramente diferenciadas: por un lado, relaciones de tenencia de la tierra en las cuales la renta se paga según un porcentaje pactado de la cosecha (share tenancy) y, por otro, trabajadores a porcentaje (share labor), cuya actividad es remunerada en funcián de una proporción de la producción (Wells 1996).

In both production processes we can see flexible ways of organization and methods of payment for work, which permit these undertakings to adapt themselves to the new demands of the market and production.

At present, within the context of modern production processes, we can observe that forms of contracts used in sharecropping can go from a work relationship whose remunation is a percentage to land tenure relationships exclusively; between both extremes one encounters different situations of funding associations and labour in order to effectuate production.
