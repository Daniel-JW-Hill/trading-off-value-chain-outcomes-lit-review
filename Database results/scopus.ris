AB  - Studies on mainstreaming climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices can increase smallholder farmers’ capacity and awareness to improve food security and establish sustainable livelihoods through resilient agricultural systems, while achieving adaptation and mitigation benefits. Hence, valuable insights can be obtained from smallholder farmers in responding to present and forthcoming challenges of climate change impacts. However, there is little research work on trade-off and synergy assessments. Taking Geshy watershed in Southwest Ethiopia as a case study area, both quantitative and qualitative data analysis were undertaken in this study. The data were collected from 15 key informant interviews, 6 focus group discussions, and 384 households to answer the following questions: (1) what are the top 5 preferred CSA practices for smallholder farmers in Geshy watershed when coping with the impacts of climate change? (2) What is the performance of the preferred CSA practices? And (3) which trade-offs and synergies are experienced upon the implementation of CSA practices? The study came up with the most preferred CSA practices such as the use of improved crop varieties, small-scale irrigation, improved animal husbandry, the use of efficient inorganic fertilizers, and crop rotation with legumes. The selected CSA practices showed that the productivity goal exhibit the best synergy, while the mitigation goal has trade-offs. The study also has shown that the use of improved crop varieties causes high synergies in all 3 goals of CSA practices; small-scale irrigation provides a medium synergy on productivity goal but high synergy for adaptation and mitigation goals; improved animal husbandry shows a high synergy with the adaptation goal, a relatively lower synergy with the productivity goal, and a trade-off with the mitigation goal; the use of efficient inorganic fertilizers shows maximum synergy for the productivity and adaptation goals; and crop rotation with legumes exhibits high synergy with the productivity and mitigation goals but a relatively lower synergy with the adaptation goal. These results can provide evidence to various stakeholder farmers in the value chain that the impacts of climate change can be addressed by the adoption of CSA practices. In general, CSA practices are considered indispensable. Smallholder farmers prefer CSA practices that help to increase crop productivity and household resilience to climate change impacts. The results generate a vital foundation for recommendations to smallholder farming decision-makers. It also sensitizes actions for innovative and sustainable methods that are able to upscale the preferred CSA practices in the agricultural system in Geshy watershed of Southwest Ethiopia and other regions. © 2023 Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - This study focuses on the impact of invisible markets such as price, supply, demand, and public intervention through building intermediary organizations on rural households’ decisions to rent in or rent out land, and it compares factors that are critical in the current development of the land rental market. The study uses nationally representative farm and village survey datasets and the Box-Cox double-hurdle model. The study finds that public intervention, represented by intermediary organizations established at the grassroots level, plays a more significant role than invisible markets in improving the probability that farm households rent in or rent out land and increasing the amount of land rented. The intermediary organizations have increased the share of land area transferred to the total area at the village level. However, the price mechanisms, represented by the village-level land transfer rate and the village's average land rent, failed to guide the flow of land resources. We put forward policy implications for how public institutions and market intermediaries can promote China's land rental markets and how to perform price mechanisms more effectively. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Addressing public health externalities often requires community-level collective action. Due to social norms, each person's sanitation investment decisions may depend on the decisions of neighbors. We report on a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted with 19,000 households in rural Bangladesh where we grouped neighboring households and introduced (either financial or social recognition) rewards with a joint liability component for the group, or asked each group member to make a private or public pledge to maintain a hygienic latrine. The group financial reward has the strongest impact in the short term (3 months), inducing a 7.5–12.5 percentage point increase in hygienic latrine ownership, but this effect dissipates in the medium term (15 months). In contrast, the public commitment induced a 4.2–6.3 percentage point increase in hygienic latrine ownership in the short term, but this effect persists in the medium term. Non-financial social recognition or a private pledge has no detectable effect on sanitation investments. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Maize prices fluctuate across seasons in rural markets in many low income countries, and agricultural households struggle to sell their grain at an optimal time. We provide new insight into a persistent puzzle: small farmers in low-income countries tend to sell their maize at harvest, when prices are low, rather than storing and waiting until prices increase later in the year. Our descriptive analysis uses 20 years of data from 1038 retail markets in 30 African countries to demonstrate that the lean season price (the “high price” season) fails to rise above the harvest season price (the “low price” season) 16.3% of the time on average in countries with a single maize season and between 15.9% and 24.9% on average in countries with two maize seasons. On the basis of that stylized fact, we propose that aversion to these negative returns may contribute to farmers' decisions to opt out of storage at harvest. Using a smaller dataset of 425 retail markets in 10 countries with a single maize season, we show that even moderately risk averse farmers would opt out of storage in 15.3% of market years. Farmers cannot always predict returns to storage and output price risk may dissuade farmers from storing maize for the purpose of future sales, despite credit access. Our results indicate that other mechanisms, such as forward contracts or multiyear credit, may be necessary to mitigate downside price risk. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - This paper examines the gendered trait preferences for rice and their role in the adoption of improved rice varieties among men and women rice farmers in Ghana. Four hundred rice farm households and 261 consumers were surveyed across 20 communities using a simple random sampling technique. Kendall’s coefficient of concordance, Tobit, and the multivariate probit regressions were used in the analyses. The results show differences in preferences for cooking quality traits and postharvest traits among men and women farmers. There was also a gender differential in the intensity of purchasing rice among men and women consumers. The results show that rice farmers’ decisions to adopt any of the four varieties—AGRA rice, Jasmine, Togo Marshall, or Amankwatia—are influenced by age, being married or indigenous, years of schooling, off-farm activities, farming experience, household size, farm size, FBO membership, extension contact, market proximity, and access to credit. To improve the rice value chain in Ghana, rice breeding efforts should consider varieties with trait preferences such as being tolerant of pest and diseases, aromatic, early maturing, and tolerance to shattering. However, to enhance the consumption of improved rice varieties, breeding efforts should target varieties that are aromatic, good textured, and have medium-sized grains for female consumers, while for male consumers preferred varieties would be less easily broken, white grain color, translucent, and with short cooking time. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Farmers' inability to successfully participate in the maize value chain due to the threats of some risk factors is one of the key reasons for rising food insecurity. This study analyses farmers' responses to risks involved in maize production in Cameroon. Data on maize production risks were collected from smallholder maize farmers operating in selected communities along the River Sanaga. The Criticality Risk Matrix model was employed to determine the severity of these risks based on their criticality and likelihood of occurrence. After deriving farmers' risk preferences from the categorization of their farm decisions, a Multinomial Logit Regression model was then used to investigate the extent to which risk severity influences farm decisions. Additionally, a Graded Response Model was utilized to predict farmers' risk responses by categorizing their probable patterns of action. The results revealed that production risks with fatal consequences such as pest invasion had a negative significant influence on-farm decisions and their perceived threats were more likely to provoke risk-averse responses. Less fatal risk threats such as fertilizer unavailability, poor farm infrastructure, labour shortage, and health risks were all significant and induced risk-averse responses from farmers. Furthermore, gender, experience and employment status also significantly influence farm decision-making. The farmers’ response patterns presented on the Graded Response Model Characteristic Curves further indicated the willingness of farmers to continue farm activities despite perceived risks and the probability of engaging in diversification as an added measure to mitigate risks. We recommended that more effective measures for information dissemination on production risks as well as sustained Extension Service support to mitigate these risks be made available to farmers. © 2023

AB  - This study tries to evaluate the returns to contract farming (CF) in the form of farm efficiency for both contract and non-contract wheat growers in Haryana, North India. Applying the data envelopment analysis and endogenous switching regression model on cross-sectional survey data from 754 wheat farmers, it finds that CF adopters are significantly more efficient than non-adopters. Further, it reveals that farmers who adopt CF would reduce their technical efficiency by 16% if they do not participate in it. But non-adopters would increase their technical efficiency by 12% if they adopt instead. This is attributed to CF provisions of higher quality inputs and improved production technology. However, results also indicate that a small percentage of farmers are dealing with some financial constraints, including delayed payment, high cost of inputs, and lack of timely access to financial assistance. This needs to be addressed adequately in order to enfold the smallholders in the ambit of contracting system. © 2023

AB  - Commitments to curb illegal logging and deforestation have proliferated in recent years with the increase of global trade in tropical timber and wood products. While they reflect international sustainability demands, the employed mechanisms to assure timber legality verification may not reflect conditions faced by local private sector actors. Facing rapid forest loss and limited foreign market access, government of Myanmar started reforming its forest policy to include a system of timber legality verification. Drawing on policy analysis and mixed-methods field research, we evaluate the feasibility of the policy reform to achieve economic and environmental upgrading in the timber value chain. Our findings question the transformative capacity of this policy reform. Not only that it failed to meet its sustainability goals, it has also created favourable conditions for a race to the bottom and concentration in the timber value chain. Economic and environmental upgrading take place at the expense of private smallholders who are expected to address a range of obstacles, including limited access to inputs, quality downgrading, and increased operational costs, which hamper their performance. To prevent socio-environmental losses, forest-sector regulatory reforms should be particularly mindful of these challenges in the midstream segment of the value chain. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Forest Farmers' Organizations (FFOs) are gaining scholarly traction as a means to mobilize non-industrial private farmers to upscale tree-growing practices, thereby contributing to securing the increasing demand for wood products. However, how farmers perceive FFOs and what drives their willingness to participate in FFOs are not yet fully understood. Using two case studies, this study aimed to examine smallholder tree growers' perceptions of FFOs and the main factors influencing their willingness to participate in FFOs. Data were collected from 185 and 190 farm forestry households in Ethiopia and Tanzania, respectively, and triangulated with focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Grounded in the social exchange theory, we employed regression analysis and thematic analysis to analyze the data. The results showed that 74% and 90% of smallholders would be willing to participate in an FFO in the Ethiopian and Tanzanian cases, respectively. In Ethiopia, farmers understood an FFO as a tree marketing cooperative or a collective wood marketing enterprise. Household heads in the middle age group and those who experienced price satisfaction in the last woodlot sales would be more likely to participate in an FFO. In Tanzania, tree growers associations focused on social learning and wood production improvement. Those more likely to participate had larger household sizes and difficulty accessing the wood market. We proposed a hypothesis and further research agenda, calling for a panel study to complement our conceptual assertion. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The bushmeat trade provides an income to hunters, transporters, and vendors living in the vicinity of protected areas but remains a challenge to wildlife conservation objectives. The key factors driving the source, choice and use of bushmeat vary among actors in the commercial bushmeat value chain, and insights into these determinants are required to facilitate the development of conservation strategies. Therefore, we aimed to identify the socioeconomic factors that explain the source of supply and quantities of bushmeat available in households and local restaurants. We carried out a survey with 144 rural household heads and 24 restaurant owners in 20 villages in the Western part of Taï National Park in Côte d'Ivoire. We found that bushmeat quantity and species diversity were low in households, originating mainly from subsistence hunting. However, both the amount of bushmeat and the variety of species were high in restaurants and primarily supplied by commercial hunters. Furthermore, the quantity of bushmeat was lower in households with other protein sources and in restaurants in villages that had been the target of more conservation awareness campaigns. We highlight the importance of understanding the determinants of bushmeat supply to regulate the bushmeat trade by applying relevant conservation interventions. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Purpose: Agriculture value chains (AVCs) have experienced unprecedented disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic, with lockdowns and stringent social distancing restrictions making buying and selling behaviours complex and uncertain. This study aims provide a theoretical framework describing the stakeholder behaviours that arise in severely disrupted value chains, which give rise to inter-organisational initiatives that impact industry sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods approach is adopted, in which uncertainty theory and relational governance theory and structured interviews with 15 AVC stakeholders underpin the initial conceptual model. The framework is empirically validated via partial least squares structural equation modelling using data from an online survey of 185 AVC stakeholders based in India. Findings: The findings reveal that buyer and supplier uncertainty created by the COVID-19 lockdowns gives rise to behaviours that encourage stakeholders to engage in relational governance initiatives. Progressive farmers and other AVC stakeholders welcome this improved information sharing, which encourages self-reliance that positively impacts agricultural productivity and sustainability. Practical implications: The new framework offers farmers and other stakeholders in developing nations possibilities to sustain their AVCs even in dire circumstances. In India, this also requires an enabling ecosystem to enhance smallholders' marketing power and help them take advantage of recent agricultural reforms. Originality/value: Research is scarce into the impact of buyer and seller behaviour during extreme supply chain disruptions. This study applies relational governance and uncertainty theories, leading to a proposed risk aversion theory. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Non-farm income is a major source of income, along with farming for most rural households, that seems to offer a pathway out of poverty. It has gained prominence in recent times as an alternative strategy. However, it is often not clear how non-farm income can contribute to farm output and income because empirical results from existing literature remain somewhat ambiguous. Therefore, more robust research is needed to understand what conditions lead to what outcomes and to identify appropriate policy responses. We extend the previous literature in the direction of understanding more finely the potential impact of non-farm income on output and farm income distributions, applying a novel approach, IVQTEs, for the first time in this context. In this paper, we analyzed the drivers of non-farm income as an alternative strategy, and its distributive impacts on cassava farmers' output and farm income in Southwestern Nigeria. A multistage sampling procedure was employed to select 300 cassava farmers for the study. Data were analysed using the novel nehurdle estimation procedure of the double hurdle model. Our methodology of using an instrumental variable quantile treatment effect model (IVQTE) explicitly demonstrates the impact of non-farm income on farm output and income distribution at different levels. The first hurdle (Probit regression) of nehurdle results show that age, household size, years of education, years of experience, farm size, and access to credit may likely influence the decision to participate in non-farm income works; while, in the second hurdle, household size, age, years of education, farm size, gender, asset ownership, cooperative membership are the significant factors that may likely influence the amount realized from non-farm income works. Our results reveal a positive marginal impact of non-farm income at all quantiles of the conditional distribution of cassava farmers’ output and farm income, with the impact being the lowest at the lowest quantile (25th quantile) and increased across the other quantiles. In this regard, the study suggests that the creation of job opportunities outside farming will supplement on-farm works and enhance household's income. This study also suggests that measures such as education, extension services and cooperative societies, to enhance participation in non-farm income works, will spur the rural economy in Nigeria and other developing countries. © 2022

AB  - Storage of food commodities for some time after harvest can play an important role in alleviating the downside of price fluctuations in developing countries. While storage can offer smallholder farmers substantial inter-temporal arbitrage opportunities, existing evidence shows that many farmers in developing countries store little of their harvest. Using a cross sectional survey of 502 households in Nyandarua and Bomet Counties of Kenya, this paper assessed smallholder farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) for cold storage and compares their WTP with the arbitrage opportunities. Our results reveal that the storage of potato was generally limited with only 26% storing in the season preceding the study. Using a hypothetical scenario with double-bounded contingent valuation formats, our findings show that a considerable proportion of households (70.7%) were willing to rent cold storage facilities. The WTP for storing a 90 kg bag of Shangi, a common variety with a short shelf life (1 month) was Kenya shillings (KES) 104 (1.16/kg/month) compared KES 96.4 (1.07/kg/month) for the Unica variety (slightly longer shelf life). The probit model results show that gender (being female), and transaction costs associated with access to markets (e.g., geographical location and distance to the road) were positively associated with WTP. Furthermore, household endowment, reflected in household expenditure, income and level of potato commercialization had a positive influence on WTP to store. In addition, institutional characteristics of collective action, previous experience with storage and use of certified seed (often associated with extension) enhanced households WTP for potato storage. The results on potato prices over a 5-year period (2014–2019) show that seasonal price gaps were higher than the estimated WTP, suggesting that potato storage could be economically viable. These findings have significant policy implications not only for commodities whose harvest is perishable and season bound (e.g., vegetables, fruits) where arbitrage may offer price stabilization. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Cooperatives are known worldwide as important institutional commitments to overcome the constraints faced by small farmers in developing countries. We conducted an in-depth investigation in order to identify the reasons behind the underdevelopment of agricultural cooperatives in Romania, as well as the solutions that the representatives of cooperatives see, starting from the premise that they are the main connoisseurs of this activity, knowing the strengths, but especially the weaknesses of this activity, by administering a questionnaire-based survey as the main research tool. Clearly, cooperative representatives are aware of the socio-economic implications and role of cooperatives, with average values closer to “total agreement”, especially in terms of contribution to food security. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This study aims to understand and profile smallholder farmers' technology adoption status. We collected cross-sectional data from 600 smallholder dairy farming households in West Java, Indonesia. A Latent class cluster analysis identified two unique clusters of smallholder dairy farmers based on patterns in their adoption status of multiple dairy farming technologies. Cluster 1 (Low awareness/low adoption) had significantly lower awareness of all technologies, and among the “aware” farmers, technology adoption rates were also significantly lower compared to Cluster 2 (High awareness/high adoption). The Low awareness/low adoption cluster was older, had less formal education, managed fewer dairy cows, had less productive and less profitable dairy enterprises, lived further away from their cooperative and farmer group leader, and had fewer contacts with dairy extension staff. Farmers' responses to questions regarding reasons underpinning nonadoption decisions suggest that farmers face multilayered and heterogenous constraints to adopting dairy technologies. This insight can assist government, policymakers, and development professionals in designing technology dissemination programs that meet the unique characteristics of subgroups of farmers, ultimately improving the adoption of technologies.

AB  - Team leadership plays a crucial role in the management of agricultural cooperatives, especially in post-Soviet countries where farmers keep bad experiences from the collectivization of their farms. The main objective of the research was to investigate how important the role of leadership is in the process of establishing, initial sustaining of cooperation and members’ commitment among small farmers in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Leadership was analysed from multiple perspectives using an explanatory sequential mixed approach involving quantitative and qualitative methods. We interviewed 293 cooperative leaders and members. The partial least squares structural equation model was used to examine the relationship between multiple constructs and variables. We concluded that leaders do differ in some of their characteristics from other members. They are the most active in the group, influencing all major decisions, playing a crucial role in trust-building and group cohesion. Their skills and leadership style are significantly important for members’ commitment to the group's success. However, the dominance of group founders and lack of understanding of cooperative principles among members indicate some emerging challenges to the cooperatives’ sustainability and efficiency, and it is necessary to focus on the progressive professionalization and capacity building of leaders while maintaining a transformational leadership style. © 2021 Edgard Milhaud Foundation.

AB  - Bangladesh’s aquaculture sector has contributed progressively to the nation’s economy over the years, but the COVID-19 pandemic has impeded fish farmers’ access to markets, reduced their production and sales capacity, resulted in lower income, and increased food security vulnerability. This study assesses how COVID-19 affects smallholder fish farmers and their response strategies by employing data collected from 250 fish farmers and traders from intensive fish-growing areas of Bangladesh. The results reveal that most farmers experienced difficulty obtaining inputs, and the price of those inputs skyrocketed during the COVID-19 period, resulting in several months of decreased production and operations. As a result of COVID-19, farm gate prices for silver carp, ruhu, common carp, grass carp, and tilapia fish dropped by 25%, 23%, 23%, 22%, 23%, and 40%, respectively. On the other hand, fish feed prices were found to increase significantly. Reduced income from fish farming and other sources has triggered a significant drop in capital for farming operations and production capacity improvement, leading to food insecurity. The most common coping strategies include reduced buying from the market (vegetables, fruits, meat, milk, etc.), relying on less expensive or less preferred food, purchasing food on credit, and selling assets. Notably, due to COVID-19, a new mode of marketing has evolved as an adaptation strategy in the fish marketing system, such as the use of the mobile phone (18%) and Facebook/internet to sell fish directly to the customer (16%). The sector requires short-term financial assistance to assist fish actors with production and marketing challenges. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Motivation: For decades, governments, donors, and practitioners have promoted market-based development approaches (MBDA), most recently in the form of value chain development (VCD), to spur economic growth and reduce poverty. Changes in approaches have been shaped by funders, practitioners and researchers in ways that are incompletely appreciated. Purpose: We address the following questions: (1) how have researchers and practitioners shaped discussions on MBDA?; and (2) how has research stimulated practice, and how has practice informed research? We hypothesize that stronger exchange between researchers and practitioners increases the relevance and impact of value chain research and development. Methods and approach: We adopt Downs' (1972) concept of issue-attention cycles, which posits that attention to a particular issue follows a pattern where, first, excitement builds over potential solutions; followed by disenchantment as the inherent complexity, trade-offs, and resources required to solve it become apparent; and consequently attention moves on to a new issue. We review the literature on MBDA to see how far this framing applies. Findings: We identify five cycles of approaches to market-based development over the last 40 or more years: (1) non-traditional agricultural exports; (2) small and medium enterprise development; (3) value chains with a globalization perspective; (4) value chains with an agri-business perspective; and (5) value chain development. The shaping and sequencing of these cycles reflect researchers' tendency to analyse and criticize MBDA, while providing limited guidance on workable improvements; practitioners' reluctance to engage in critical reflection on their programmes; and an institutional and funding environment that encourages new approaches. Policy implications: Future MBDA will benefit from stronger engagement between researchers, practitioners, and funders. Before shifting attention to new concepts and approaches, achievements and failures in previous cycles need to be scrutinized. Evidence-based practice should extend for the length of the issue-attention cycle; preferably it should arrest the cycling of attention. Funders can help by requiring grantees to critically reflect on past action, by providing “safe spaces” for sharing such reflections, and by engaging in joint learning with practitioners and researchers. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Worldwide coffee production, especially Arabica coffee, is threatened by climatic change, plants diseases and vulnerability of smallholders. Meanwhile, consumers’ demand for socially and environmentally sustainable products is steadily increasing, driving the engagement of stakeholders in agro-ecological and social initiatives. Here we present a new organizational model, the “Coffee agroforestry business-driven cluster” (CaFC), which aims at preserving ecosystems while offering producers a fair income. Based on an original local micro value-chain dedicated to sustainable production of high-quality Arabica coffee under agroforestry systems, the CaFC model stands out by addressing the issues around plantation renovation, a crucial process that requires considerable investments from producers. Methods: Based on a pilot project in Nicaragua, we illustrate how the operational principles of CaFC can be applied in a real setting. Using data shared by key stakeholders involved in the project, we assess the profitability of the CaFC model by comparing different scenarios and applying sensitivity analysis. We then reflect on the reproducibility of the model in other contexts, building on lessons learned from ongoing implementations in Vietnam and Cameroon. Results: For producers renovating their plantations, the CaFC model consistently outperforms other scenarios, offering high quality premiums coupled with capacity building, access to highly productive varieties that perform well under agroforestry systems and adapted credit with favourable repayment schemes. Implementation in Vietnam and Cameroon show that the model can be successfully replicated with some adaptation to local contexts. These cases also highlight the importance of mutual interests, trust and communication in enabling collaboration between stakeholders. Conclusions: The CaFC model has great potential for positive environmental and economic impact and offers strong incentives for stakeholders involved in its resulting micro value-chain. The concept was initially developed in Nicaragua for coffee but could also be adapted in other countries or even to other commodities such as cocoa. Copyright: © 2023 Meter A et al.

AB  - Using the new economics labor migration theory as a theoretical framework and the multinomial treatment effects negative binomial regression as an analytical model in southern Ethiopia, this study investigated the effects of rural out-migration on the intensity of agricultural technology adoption. In the year 2021, data were collected from 415 sample houses using stratified random sampling. Regression analysis showed that while the influence of migration from rural to urban areas is negligible, participation in international migration greatly increases the likelihood of technology adoption in rural families by 38.9%. The intensity of agricultural technology adoption by rural households is negatively and significantly correlated with male-headed households and household age, while the frequency of extension visits, non-farm participation, saving, membership in cooperatives, sales of livestock, and tropical livestock unit are positively and significantly related to the intensity of agricultural technology adoption. The outcome is consistent with the labor migration theory's risk and credit hypotheses. To encourage the adoption of agricultural technology and stop the recent surge of rural out-migration in southern Ethiopia, policymakers should provide access to capital, public services, and viable off-farm employment in rural areas © 2023, Agris On-line Papers in Economics and Informatics.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Agricultural practices naturally interject greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere; consequently, analyzing decadal variation in N2O, CO2, and CH4 is indispensable over a major rice cultivating area (West Bengal) in subtropical India. Analysis of EDGAR data shows an unremitting increase in GHGs in the study region over two decades. The increasing global warming makes us revisit climate-resilient strategies to mitigate the risk of climate change on paddy production in agrarian economies. However, adapting to these strategies and impact assessment is necessary to comprehend their productiveness and further policy recommendation. Therefore, this study identifies the determinants of adaptation and measures the impact of these strategies on farm performance (yield and net income) and food security of smallholder paddy farmers in India. We used primary data from 612 paddy farmers from 20 villages in the Hooghly district, West Bengal, India. The study used probit regression analysis to identify adaptation constraints and Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) to determine the change in the direction and magnitude of the determinants of adaptation strategies. The study also used the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) approach to estimate the causal impact of climate adaptation on paddy yield, net income, and food security. Probit model outcomes identified that education level, cooperative membership, access to extension services, and institutional credit adoption positively and significantly impacted climate change adaptation across smallholders. MLR analysis identified that the direction and magnitude of the discussed determinants changed with different combinations of adaptation choices. The PSM results estimated that adaptation of climate-resilient strategies impacted paddy productivity, net income, and food security positively and significantly. In addition, paddy farmers using a more significant number of climate adaptation strategies experienced better yield, revenue, and food security than those farmers using fewer adaptation strategies.

AB  - Smallholder farmers in lower-income countries often lack access to agricultural inputs, services, and markets. This holds especially for female farmers, with important negative implications for agricultural productivity, child welfare, and rural development. Contract farming is promoted as a means to improving farmers’ access to inputs, services, and markets–and thereby household income and welfare. Could contract farming also reduce prevalent gender disparities? And does it matter who within the household holds the contract? Here, we address these questions and explore patterns, drivers, and implications of women’s participation in contract farming. For this purpose, we use a unique dataset that is nationally representative of smallholder farmers in five African countries, which is the exception in this literature. Moreover, the data allow us to differentiate between different forms of women’s participation in contract farming, which is also an exception in this literature. We differentiate between female-headed and male-headed households and the gender of the contract holder. We find that participation rates among women are lower than those among men–but higher than previous case studies suggest. Our results regarding the importance of the gender of the contract holder for household living standards are inconclusive, for both male-headed and female-headed households, and there is great heterogeneity across countries. We conclude that the topic merits further exploration and discuss directions for future research and implications for policy. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Diversifying rural livelihoods plays a significant role for rain feed-dependent economy of the rural households like in Ethiopia. Hence the objective of the study was to investigate the determinants of rural households’ livelihood diversification strategies choice in north wollo zone of Ethiopia. A multi-stage stratified random sampling technique was used to select 384 rural household heads as a sample in study areas. Primary data was collected from sample rural household heads using an interview schedule. Multivariate Probit Model was employed to identify the factors influencing the rural household heads’ decision to choose livelihood strategies. The model result showed that agriculture livelihood strategy was positively and significantly associated with male headed household, land holding, cooperative membership, and participation in rural productive safety net program; while it is negatively and significantly affected by distance to market. Non-farm livelihood strategy was positively and significantly affected by dependency ratio, education level, total income, and remittance; while it is negatively and significantly affected by the sex of household head and participation in rural productive safety net program. Off-farm livelihood strategy was positively and significantly influenced by sex of household head; while it is negatively and significantly affected by the land holding, total livestock unit, cooperative membership, credit use, participation in rural productive safety net program. Therefore, the study recommends that local government should attempt to promote the above significant determinants of rural households’ livelihood diversification strategies choice to build more profitable and sustainable livelihood strategies. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Technology adoption is key to overcoming climate-related risks to smallholder farmers and declining soil fertility in sub-Sahara Africa. This study estimates the effect of participation in Ghana’s Fertilizer Subsidy Program (GFSP) on the adoption intensity of Sustainable Intensification Practices (SIPs) and gross farm inputs, using a nationally representative dataset of 4365 maize-growing households for two survey periods (2012/2013) and (2016/2017). The study finds that participation in the GFSP increases the adoption intensity in both SIPs and gross farm inputs. The study also finds that mutual aid schemes, farmer cooperatives, agricultural loans, household wealth, and connection of a farm household dwelling to the national electricity grid positively and significantly increase adoption intensity of SIPs and gross farm inputs. Improving access to the GFSP among poor farm households, provision of rural electrification, strengthening and resourcing enabling factors (such as mutual aid schemes and farmer cooperatives) at the local level can facilitate Ghana’s drive towards a sustainable agricultural production. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The Vietnamese government encourages organic farming (OF) as a move toward safer and more eco-friendly agricultural practices. To achieve the goal of popularizing OF, besides encouraging the participation of newcomers, the government should also focus on farmers already involved because their production decisions are the most effective means for communication. By blending quantitative and qualitative approaches, this study investigated smallholder farmer intentions to scale up organic rice farming (ORF). Data were obtained through direct interviews with 325 farmers in the Phu Vang, Phong Dien and Huong Thuy Districts of Thua Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam. The results revealed the ineffectiveness in demographic characteristics, including gender, age, education, number of laborers, OF experience, percentage of organic rice area, non-farm jobs and involvement in community-based organizations to predict farmer intentions to expand ORF. The findings highlighted the more significant influence of factors related to economic outcomes, farmer awareness of OF, and their confidence in the market outlook. We recommend policies and interventions associated with promoting the advantages of organic agriculture, intensifying technical training, linking production with the market following the value chain model, equipping the market with information, diversifying support and timely undertaking of issued policies. © 2023, The Japan Section of the Regional Science Association International.

AB  - GLOBAL Good Agricultural Practices (GLOBAL G.A.P.) standards have appeared to increasingly control the exchange of horticultural products in the international market. To make horticulture exports viable and lucrative, smallholder farmers need to invest in GLOBAL G.A.P. While research has focused on the impact of adoption on the welfare of farmers, the factors stimulating the adoption of these standards have been ignored. This study examines the determinants of the adoption of GGAPs (GLOBAL G.A.P.) among smallholder French bean producers in Murang’a South Sub-County. The study used cross-sectional data from a random sample of 215 farmers. The adoption index was used to determine adoption levels per household while a “gologit model” was applied to assess factors influencing the adoption of GGAPs among farmers. The adoption index results indicate that farmers on the contract had higher adoption levels (66%) relative to non-contracted farmers (34%). Based on the gologit findings, the determinants of farmer’s compliance levels were age (P < 0.01), gender (P < 0.1), education (P < 0.01), household size (P < 0.01), training (P < 0.01), extension service (P < 0.05), group membership (P < 0.05), farming experience (P < 0.05), vertical coordination options (VCO) (P < 0.1) and market availability(P < 0.01) and reliability (P < 0.05). Therefore, this study recommends an incentive that will promote the improvement of agricultural extension to facilitate contract farming for the adoption of GGAPs. Additionally, the government should put in place measures to safeguard farmers from market exploitation. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Seasonal commodity price fluctuations can potentially offer farmers arbitrage opportunities to increase their income. However, smallholder farmers in most of sub-Saharan Africa often do not exploit these opportunities to the fullest extent possible. To inform this issue, we conducted a randomized controlled trial among 1739 smallholder farmers in Malawi to estimate the impact of two key post-harvest constraints, lack of appropriate storage technology and commitment issues, on farmers' legume storage and sales decisions. The treated groups received (i) an improved storage technology in the form of two hermetic (airtight) bags, (ii) the same improved storage technology under the condition that farmers store collectively with members of their farmer club in their village, and/or (iii) the improved storage technology under the condition that farmers store collectively at a centralized association warehouse. We analyzed the impacts of these treatments on storage behavior and revenue from sales. Results indicated that addressing the technological and commitment constraints simultaneously had the largest average impacts. One year after the intervention, farmers offered hermetic bags and the village storage program (Treatment 2) stored 24% more legumes at harvest, stored 27% longer, received a 3% higher price for their legumes and ultimately made 12% more on average than farmers in the control group. Farmers in that treatment also improved some (but not all) outcomes compared to farmers in other treatment groups. These findings suggest that combining technology with collective action that is localized and flexible can lead to better post-harvest outcomes for smallholder farmers. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Analyzing governance structure is considered important when designing development interventions in the value chain. The objective of this paper was to explore the governance structure (GS) in cauliflower and tomato value chain, specifically the types of GS followed by the farmers and factors behind these choices. The two-stage random sampling procedure was used to collect data from 100 farmers whereas 60 traders were surveyed purposively for this study. Multinomial logit model was used to analyze the factors affecting farmer’s choice of GS. Trader’s perceptions regarding internal and external governance as well as good governance indicators were assessed by utilizing non-parametric test. Cauliflower and tomato farmers were involved in practicing spot market, relational, farmer’s association and outgrowing scheme-based GS. The results showed that the probability to choose relational, outgrowing scheme and farmer’s association-based GS were significantly affected by education of farmers, distance to the nearest market, access to extension services, access to price information, trust commitment, transaction specific investment, preferences of diversification, farm size, transactional uncertainty, and access to producer’s cooperative. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-U test established trader’s dissimilation towards governance indicators. The study suggests that smallholder farmers need to be well organized and coordination mechanisms among all stakeholders should be increased. © 2022 Sharma et al.

AB  - Value upgrading through processing has been a core tenet of value chain interventions focusing on improving smallholder farmer welfare improvements. However, assessing the quality of processed agricultural products may be more difficult than unprocessed products. The resulting information asymmetry between producer and the buyer may lead to perverse outcomes for agrarian households. Using primary panel data collected from over 1500 coffee growing households in eastern Uganda and employing fixed effects approaches, we show that grower-level post-harvest processing has characteristics of a market for lemons and is associated with lower coffee income compared with unprocessed coffee production. Activities aiming at moving growers up the value chain should thus be integrated with relevant characteristics of the value chain, such as quality assurance. We add to the literature by presenting a clear description of the pathway from supply chains with asymmetric information over produce quality to diminished farmer welfare with a novel focus on post-harvest processing. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Diversification is key for agroecological transformations, but little is known about how it relates to farmers’ dietary diversity and food sovereignty. Our team and coffee cooperative staff conducted a participatory action research mixed methods study, including 171 surveys and 50 interviews. Over 70% of the farmers reported self-initiated diversification activities. Statistical analysis showed a significant positive correlation between crop diversity and dietary diversity, while controlling for farm size and income. To assess gender relations females responded to 41% of the surveys, and we separated focus groups by sex. Average male-owned farms were 1.8 ha larger than women-owned farms, yet we found no significant differences in household food security or dietary diversity. Additional disparities included male vs. female perceptions about who does additional diversification work and who decides about strategies. Although the co-op has a strong gender equity and technical assistance program, our analysis of extension training documents identified useful content and a smaller percent of female participants in diversification vs. gender sessions. Suggested strategic actions for co-op planning include supporting: (1) female land ownership, (2) diversification focused farmer-led experimentation, and (3) more training for men on gender, women on diversification, and all participants in feminist agroecology. © 2023 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This paper investigates public policies implemented in Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali and Senegal to support the agricultural growth pole model. We critically assess assumptions regarding expected positive spillover effects through vertical coordination and tenure formalisation. Using a comparative analysis based on a typology informed by public economics, we show that policies centre on tax exemptions and land tenure, providing only limited support to coordination of actors along the value chain–through agricultural extension services or access to funding. The ongoing implementation of agropoles in West Africa, therefore, exacerbates the risk of the model, bearing negative impacts for smallholders. © 2023 Canadian Association for the Study of International Development (CASID).

AB  - Access to cheap labour affects Ghanaian smallholder farmers significantly. Such access can be enhanced through mutual labour support. However, it has become necessary to explore how this form of collective action affects farmers’ productivity and efficiency. In this study, the impact of access to mutual labour support on productivity and technical efficiency was estimated using data collected from 592 smallholder maize farmers in Northern Ghana. The study uses a translog stochastic production frontier model, while accounting for sample selection bias that may emanate from both observable and unobservable household characteristics. Farmers with access to mutual labour support are significantly more productive and technically efficient than those without, with mean technical efficiency in the range of 0.62–0.71 for farmers with access to mutual labour support and 0.55–0.60 for those without access. Sex, education, spraying machine ownership, farm size, extension visits, access to credit, and membership of farmer-based organisation are significant determinants of access to mutual labour support. Policies to help farmer groups and extension agents promote mutual labour support accessibility among farmers are recommended. © 2022 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.

AB  - The secret to ensuring food security and the growth of agricultural development is farmland production efficiency. In the context of urbanization, this means that farmers need to increase their off-farm employment behavior. The research goal of this paper is to explore whether this will have a impact on farmland production. This paper is based on the data of the China Land Economic Survey conducted by Nanjing Agricultural University and uses Tobit and other methods to conduct empirical tests. The main findings of this paper are as follows: (1) When the proportion of the household’s off-farm employment time is less than 73%, an increase in off-farm employment reduces farmland production efficiency. When the proportion of the household’s off-farm employment time exceeds 73%, an increase in off-farm employment increases the farmland production efficiency. (2) This paper eliminates the scale efficiency contribution in farmland production efficiency to obtain pure technical production efficiency. After verification, off-farm employment and farmland pure technical production efficiency show a U-shaped correlation and the inflection points of the two U-shaped curves coincide. (3) The reason for the inflection point is that after the off-farm employment of farmers reaches the inflection point, with a further increase in off-farm employment, the renting-out behavior of farmland increases and there is increased input of labor-saving technology in agricultural land production, because of which the production efficiency and pure technical efficiency of the farmland increase. To sum up, off-farm employment does not necessarily mean reduced farmland production efficiency. Farmland leasing behavior plays a key role in mitigating the impact of off-farm employment on farmland production. Therefore, in the process of urbanization, the improvement of the land transfer market, the development of agricultural socialized services, and the promotion of cooperative operation will help to ensure the productivity of farmland. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In the context of food security, the market-oriented allocation of factors under the collective ownership system has had a profound impact on agricultural production. As a hot issue under the Household Responsibility System (HRS), the impact mechanism of farmland market transaction on agricultural production efficiency deserves discussion. Based on the stochastic frontier production function model, this paper analyzes the impact of farmland transfer on farmers’ production technical efficiency under the external environmental factors by using the moderating effect and threshold effect. The study found that farmland transfer can improve farmers’ technical efficiency. The market price of agricultural products and farmland transfer subsidies have a positive moderating effect on the impact of farmland transfer on technical efficiency. Furthermore, farmland transfer subsidy shows a nonlinear effect on the impact of technical efficiency. © 2022 by the authors.

However, these studies typically examine a single strategy effect and avoid multiple integrated strategies. Other studies focused on the complex interactions between different factors in the production chain and their feedback effects on farmers’ productivity and cash flow. For these reasons, this research provides a comprehensively dynamic model and evaluates long-term strategies and their effects on supporting and improving small farmers’ productivity and profitability. A system dynamics methodology was used to model complex systems processing Hass avocado farmer association data and explore their effects on competitiveness for long-term sustainable and profitable agriculture. This research proposes optimal scenarios for small farmers, including strategies such as low-interest credit access, logistics practices, and government technical support. The scenarios provide a proactive tool for decision makers and promote rural farmers’ development, aligning high-quality fresh product supply and demand. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Making quality seed of improved legume varieties sustainably available and accessible to farmers in a timely manner and at affordable price is a major challenge in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Overcoming this challenge requires collective and long-term action through public–private and development organization partnerships (PPDOPs). The PPDOP model was tested by key seed system actors under the Tropical Legumes (TL) and Accelerated Varietal Improvement and Seed Delivery of Legumes and Cereals in Africa (AVISA) projects from 2008 to 2021. The study used the case of groundnut in Tanzania to assess the role played by long-term PPDOPs in groundnut seed production and delivery systems. The effectiveness of seed production and delivery models of the various actors involved in the TL and AVISA projects was analyzed. The study used secondary data obtained from annual reports, unpublished and published literature, and institutional websites. The PPDOP model brought about significant changes to the seed systems. It was found that sustained seed production and delivery over a decade enhanced the performance of the groundnut value chain in Tanzania. Under the TL and AVISA projects, a total of 49,046 tons of groundnut from different seed classes were produced through PPDOPs, covering an estimated 613,078 hectares with improved groundnut varieties. The intervention reached 45,201 stakeholders through 3048 demonstration plots, 128 field days, 55 seed fairs, and 8147 tons of small seed packs of 1–5 kg. The study recommends the use of long-term PPDOPs in seed production and delivery systems for greater impacts on increased variety adoption and consistent seed supply and availability in SSA. Long-term PPDOPs ensure proper coordination, open communication, clear accountability, solid trust, and standardized practices among actors in seed production and delivery systems. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Rural electrification is a crucial process of enhancing the modern energy access of rural communities which is an important global development goal. Electric cooperatives have played an important role as drivers of rural electrification worldwide, both historically and contemporaneously. The emerging role of cooperatives in rural electrification is yet to be examined in the context of East Africa, a region that experiences serious infrastructure deficits alongside widespread rural poverty. This study adopts a political economy perspective to explore the roles and challenges of cooperatives in rural electrification in Uganda. Through a high-level case study of two electric cooperatives, we show that while the cooperatives can deliver rural electrification, they face a series of political and economic challenges in fulfilling their mission. To enhance rural electrification through cooperatives, the challenges should be addressed by policy solutions: (1) providing more support to rural households that cannot afford electricity; (2) providing further support to cooperatives to avoid overburdening the community; (3) enhancing investment to upgrade the grid and extend its geographical coverage; and (4) exploring new financial and technological options for rural electrification. We expect the findings of this study to be useful to policymakers, implementers, cooperatives, and international donors currently working in rural electrification in Africa and beyond. © 2023

AB  - Irrigation enables crop intensification and improves the smallholder's household livelihood. Centre pivot irrigation, a system predominantly used in medium to large individual farms, has recently been promoted for smallholder collective irrigation in developing countries. The objective of this research was to assess the irrigation performance and evolution of shared centre pivot systems at the Itamarati Rural Settlement in the Midwest of Brazil, where around 1000 smallholders were organized in small groups between 2001 and 2004, to farm 85 centre pivots collectively. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected in a mixed-approach, and used to characterize the evolution and sustainability of the centre pivots shared. We collected information from published and unpublished reports, and we conducted our own surveys, interviewing twenty-five farm groups and forming focus groups in a 3-year phased process. Irrigation intensity (the ratio of irrigated area over the area equipped for irrigation) declined sharply from 0.75 in 2004/2005–0.12 in 2020. The immediate pressures triggering the abandonment process were: the farmers’ insufficient technical capability, low productivity of the irrigated crops, and high operational and maintenance costs. At the root of these drivers was the incapacity to exert the collective action required by the highly centralized shared centre pivot system. The progressive giving up of collective management and the concentration of land in larger farms seems to be inexorable. The Itamarati experience was a paradigm of a top-down project whose lessons are important for policymakers. We concluded that centralized collective systems are unsustainable unless the community that adopts them has a high sense of union and a capacity for collective action. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - CONTEXT: Climate change is expected to adversely affect agricultural production, particularly in Iran where the agricultural sector forms the backbone of the economy. This is true for the agriculture sector of the southwest region of Iran which is largely rain-fed and dominated by smallholder farmers with minimal livelihood alternatives. Although several studies have been conducted on climate change, little has been done on the adaptive capacity of farmers within farming systems, especially in Iran. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to evaluate the adaptive capacity of four common farming systems (i.e., family farming system, cooperative farming system, commercialized farming system, and agro-enterprise farming system) in Fars province, southwestern Iran. METHODS: A seven-step approach was used to normalize, weigh, and aggregate 102 individual indicators within a composite adaptive capacity index that is dimensionless, ranging from 0 to 1, and 1 is the optimal value. The required data were collected using a cross-sectional survey from 1472 farmers within the four mentioned farming systems. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the highest value was recorded by agro-enterprise for knowledge, perception and awareness, transport and physical accessibility, and institution and economic resources. Agro-enterprise scored higher in terms of awareness and action, which shows that these farming systems have a higher capacity for adaptation to the threat posed by climate diversity. Farmers in this farming system benefit from high formal education, high perceptions about the threat and risk of climate change, the occurrence of climatic events, causes for the change in climatic parameters, and awareness of climate change impacts. SIGNIFICANCE: This paper recommends resilience-building interventions in the study area, which target individuals with low adaptive capacities, especially farmers. The results can also assist agricultural policymakers to recognize which components and determinants of adaptive capacity should be prioritized to mitigate the threat of climate change to farming systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The improper disposal of pesticide packaging wastes (PPW) has posed serious harm to the environment, including groundwater and soil pollution and even health concerns to the public. To address the environmental concerns and public health issues, there is a need to recycle the pesticides packaging waste (RPPW). Though small farmers in many developing countries have joined the cooperatives to reduce the production costs and increase the product premium, how these cooperatives improve farmers’ RPPW behaviors is still sparse. The current study used data collected from 725 apple farmers in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces of China to explore the phenomenon empirically. Recycling decisions and degree are used to portray the farmers’ RPPW behaviors. Firstly, the Logit model was used to analyze the effect of joining cooperatives on farmers’ recycling decisions. Further, to address the sample selection bias, the present study employed the propensity score matching (PSM) method for empirical analysis concerning the effect of joining cooperatives on farmers’ recycling degree. Results showed that joining cooperatives positively and significantly influences farmers’ recycling decisions. If farmers join a cooperative, the probability of the recycling decisions and degree will increase by 20.30% and 27.50%, respectively. Moreover, it is also found that some other factors such as education level, environmental and public health risk perception, peer effect, and relationship network also significantly influence farmers’ recycling decisions. Moreover, considering the differences in farmers’ gender, age, and educational attainment, the study unveiled the heterogeneous effects of joining cooperatives on farmers’ RPPW behaviors. The findings revealed that gender and age variables have noticeable masking effects while education level has a typical threshold effect. The overall findings provided insights for policymakers to emphasize the development of agricultural cooperatives, improve the risk and interest linkage mechanism, and build the RPPW system. These implications are also supportive for policymakers in other developing countries. © 2023, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.

AB  - Small farmers in emerging economies face numerous constraints, including financial distress and limited access to profitable markets. Thus, procurement contracts having provisions for resource inputs are essential in linking them to the mainstream agri-supply chains. Consequently, we frame a decision-making model for a risk-neutral firm offering advance payment contracts to such credit-constrained smallholders. The firm allows them to commit their supply quantities and pays a fraction of the per-unit guaranteed price for the crop as advance. Behaviorally, the decision-biased farmers are loss-averse and hyperbolic discounters. They have a subjective perception of crop yield based on the (timing of) advance. Our model establishes a criterion for the firm to shortlist the farmers for contracting. Subsequently, it predicts their commitment quantities under limited information on their behavioral parameters using the Prospect Theory framework. Under the model assumptions, we calculate the upper and lower bounds on their commitment quantities, thereby establishing the limits on the firm’s production quantity and profitability. Lastly, our model determines the optimal timing for paying the advances to the eligible farmers using two different strategies. The first favors a firm’s profit maximization objective, while the second maximizes its marginal cost savings from contracting over spot buying. Through analytical and numerical calculations, we establish that the latter approach significantly raises the farmers’ utilities without severely affecting the firm’s profit. Thus, making it fit for a social entrepreneur on a mission to create a socially responsible and economically viable procurement strategy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study explores the adaptation strategies to water shortage at the farm level in the Tunisian semi-arid region and investigates factors determining the farmers’ behavior. In this area, climate change exacerbates the scarcity of water resources, groundwater suffers from saline intrusion, and the reinforcement of surface water depends on the water transfer decision. Based on 81 farmers survey data collected in Diar El Hajjaj irrigated area, the typology of farmers was constructed using the multivariate technique combining the clustering method and principal component analysis.The results show that two groups of the surveyed farmers use more intensive water resources to grow high-value crops and operate toward a commercial farming system. They set up either an accommodating or an expansive plan. The remaining sampled farmers are smallholder farmers who endure critical resource constraints. They tend to adopt a contractive strategy and face a real risk of farming abandonment. Additional actions should be taken at the farm level as well at the national policy level to preserve the farming system under water scarcity due to climate change effects. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Agroecological practices are promoted as a more proactive approach than conventional agriculture to achieving a collective global response to climate change and variability while building robust and resilient agricultural systems to meet food needs and protect the integrity of ecosystems. There is relatively limited evidence on the key traditional agroecological knowledge and practices adopted by smallholder farmers, the factors that influence smallholder farmers’ decision to adopt these practices, and the opportunities it presents for building resilient agricultural systems. Using a multi-scale mixed method approach, we conducted key informant interviews (n ​= ​12), focus group discussions (n ​= ​5), and questionnaire surveys (N ​= ​220) to explore the traditional agroecological knowledge and practices, the influencing factors, and the opportunities smallholder farmers presented for achieving resilient agricultural systems. Our findings suggest that smallholder farmers employ a suite of traditional agroecological knowledge and practices to enhance food security, combat climate change, and build resilient agricultural systems. The most important traditional agroecological knowledge and practices in the study area comprise cultivating leguminous crops, mixed crop-livestock systems, and crop rotation, with Relative Importance Index (RII) values of 0.710, 0.708, and 0.695, respectively. It is reported that the choice of these practices by smallholder farmers is influenced by their own farming experience, access to market, access to local resources, information, and expertise, and the perceived risk of climate change. Moreover, the results further show that improving household food security and nutrition, improving soil quality, control of pest and disease infestation, and support from Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and local authorities are opportunities for smallholder farmers in adopting traditional agroecological knowledge and practices for achieving resilient agricultural systems. The findings call into question the need for stakeholders and policy-makers at all levels to develop capacity and increase the awareness of traditional agroecological knowledge and practices as mechanisms to ensure resilient agricultural systems for sustainable food security. © 2022 Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Domestic animals, especially small ruminants, are an important source of income for millions of smallholder farmers, particularly women, in Senegal. The aim of this study was to understand the place of the bovine and caprine milk value chains and to identify the role and challenges for women in the Fatick livestock production sector. A survey was conducted among a sample of 50 female producers, including 30 and 20 from the bovine and caprine milk value chains, respectively. Descriptive statistics were performed to compare the caprine and bovine milk value chains in terms of activities, products, and implications for household incomes while showing the place of women at different links of these value chains. The result of the study showed that the bovine milk value chain provided higher income compared to the caprine’s, but the latter was found to be more diverse in terms of milk-derived products with increased income opportunities’ potential. Remoteness, lack of equipment, and cultural biases were reported to be the main constraints in the caprine value chain, while milk price fluctuations were reported to be the biggest challenge for producers in the bovine milk value chain. Access to land and government subsidy programs and domestic time management were the main and specific challenges affecting women in the bovine and caprine value chains. Therefore, there is a need for the establishment of policies and interventions that consider the needs, opportunities, and complementarity offered by both the caprine and bovine milk value chains across smallholder women settings, while putting gender mainstreaming at the center of the discussions and reforms. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Analysis of rubber and rubberwood biomass management revealed an actualized twin-loop circularity arising from the multibillion-dollar export revenue downstream and upstream segments. Despite resembling a zero-waste and resource-efficient system, the revenue from natural rubber exports does not translate as the wealth of rubber smallholders, pressing them as the persistent ‘poor dad’ in the rubber value chain. This study dwells on how to empower smallholders through high-quality rubber production efficiency to compensate for the nose-diving rubber price. Analysis of the challenges facing the seemingly forced labor recognized operational costs as the main hindrance to productivity. Mapping the challenges through the biomass circularity lenses identified the strengths of the sector as clear opportunities to exploit the rubber and rubberwood commodities. Access to productive clones, a shift to machine-tapper and farm-integrated rubber and rubberwood processors are the immediately actionable solutions. Availing expandable rubber-related education programs for youths in smallholder families is critical to actualizing technology-driven, and high-productivity farming for the segment to build back better. Continuous learning is mandatory to innovate, engage in the value chain, and multiply the current twin-loop circularity for the succession of dignified smallholders in sustaining the rubber industry. © 2022, Penerbit Akademia Baru.

AB  - The decision to choose an appropriate market outlet may involve a self-selection problem. This suggests that unobservable characteristics play an important role, and the examination of the impact of market outlet choice on smallholder household welfare needs to correct this selection bias. Consequently, this study, by using a multinomial endogenous treatment model, examined the determinants of market outlet choices and their subsequent effects on the welfare of smallholder vegetable and fruit producers in Ethiopia. The results on the determinants of market outlet choices obtained using this model indicated that distance to main roads, livestock ownership, access to extension, and cooperative membership influenced the decisions of smallholder farmers in one way or another. Furthermore, the model results obtained by correcting the selectivity indicated that, relative to formal markets, informal markets have a low impact on the welfare of smallholder farmers. Thus, alternative policy measurements aimed at improving the food security and welfare of smallholder farmers should be accompanied by improving their access to formal markets. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Chinese agriculture is experiencing a transition from smallholder farming to the emergence of commercial farms that are characterized by intensification and specialization in production, as well as commercialization and cooperation in management. It requires substantial capital to facilitate such a transition, but it is very difficult for farmers in China to access bank credit. One way that commercial farms have to overcome such handicap is by organizing themselves into cooperatives. To assess the effect of cooperatives on the credit accessibility of commercial farms, we have developed a theoretical model as well as an empirical study of commercial farms in Jiangsu Province based on data from a survey of 754 commercial farm owners. Instrumental variable (IV) methods and the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method that control endogeneity problem are used in the analysis. The empirical results show that cooperatives have a significant positive impact on the credit access of commercial farms. Commercial farms participating in cooperatives may alleviated their credit constraints by about 17.3 percentage points and increase the average credit per capita by nearly 80,000 Yuan. Cooperatives improve the credit access of commercial farms by exerting strong market power and reputation effect based on its organizational advantages. A disaggregated analysis also reveals that small commercial farms tend to benefit more from cooperatives in improving credit access than large commercial farms. © 2022 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society.

AB  - We study smallholder households livelihood profiles in central Kenya in an area characterized by the presence of many large commercial farms. We surveyed 375 smallholder households, compared them according to three categories (employed, contract farmers, households non-engaged with commercial farms), and constructed a livelihood index. The results show that contract farmers and households employed on farms are only a small fraction of all smallholders. Employed and non-employed households show little difference in overall livelihood profiles. Results suggest that employment on large commercial farms is mainly a coping strategy for younger households or in times of need. Contract farmers were found only in a specific location and had better access to irrigation water and higher livestock holdings. Comparison with earlier data shows the persistence of precarious livelihood levels and household strategies aiming at diversification of activities, with little evolution over the last 20 years despite the presence of commercial farms. Overall, there is little evidence that the proximity to the commercial farms offers a way out of poverty for nearby smallholder farmers. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Background: It is believed that in Ethiopia barley has been cultivated before 3000BC. Among the cereals, it is ranked in fifth place and the most important crop next to teff, sorghum, and wheat in the country. Different works of literature highlight that engagement in contract farming is one of the innovations promoted to tackle technology constraints of the smallholder farmers, as a possible solution to raising productivity and linking smallholders in the emerging modern marketing chains. Associated with the rapid rate of urbanization in the country, there is a high demand for malt barley which is resulting high expansion of beer factories. Consequently, in the study area, many farmers got into a contract agreement with Assela malt barley factories. Recent studies conducted on malt barley in Ethiopia gave much emphasis to the value chain aspect of malt barley. Therefore, the main motive behind this study was to fill the empirical literature gap in the field by giving much emphasis on the impact assessment of malt barley contract arrangement on income and food items dietary diversity of the respondent households. Methodology: To attain the study objectives, both primary and secondary data were collected and used. Randomly selected 312 households comprising 127 households engaged in malt barley contract farming arrangements and 185 non-contract households were the source of primary data for this study. Secondary data were collected from a review of different works of literature. Both descriptive and econometric models were used to analyze the primary data using Stata software version 14. The propensity score matching model was applied to examine the impact of malt barley contract farming engagement on the income and dietary diversity of the respondents. Result: It was found that family size, credit use, livestock holding, malt barley production experience, frequency of extension contact, and land allotted for malt barley production positively determine the probability of participation in malt barley contract farming arrangement. Contrary to this, distance to the malt barley collection centers negatively determine the probability of participation in malt barley contract farming. The ATT estimation of the PSM indicated that participation in malt barley contract farming has a positive impact on the income and dietary diversity of the respondent households. Conclusion: Participation in contract farming had a positive and significant impact on the annual income and dietary diversity of the smallholder households. The sensitivity analysis result showed that the impact results estimated by this study are insensitive to unobserved selection bias and the result obtained shows the true impact of contract farming on the income of the households. Therefore, concerned bodies working on malt barley production aspects as a development intervention should work to encourage non-contract farmers to engage in this activity. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Although global assessments of the initial impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have focused on income, jobs, and health conditions, this study constitutes one of the first studies that assessed the impact of COVID-19 on food security in DRC and established the short-term implications of the COVID-19 outbreak on rural households’ food security in DRC. In addition, the study recommendations contributed to shaping government interventions toward the pandemic in the Country. The study used data from four western provinces of the country on 1339 households. Our results show that 80 % of households experienced an increase in food prices, 61 % a noticeable decrease in the availability of food, and 54 % a decrease in their dietary diversity. Due to changes in food availability, dietary diversity, and food accessibility imposed by the COVID-19 outbreak, >70 % of households experienced either a decrease in the consumption of meat, milk, fish, and cereals or an increase in their consumption of traditional vegetables. In addition, COVID-19 significantly affected food security dimensions in larger households, households with a greater number of members aged 35 years and above, households headed by women, households where members participate in associations or cooperatives, households that depend on crop sales as the major source of income, and in poorer households. These findings highlight the significant implications of the COVID-19 outbreak on household food security in western DRC and underscore the need for emergency interventions to strengthen the resilience of rural people and accelerate their recovery and other long-term measures toward sustainable and inclusive development. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - To mitigate the environmental and public health consequences of agricultural fires set by smallholders, developing countries have been subsidizing alternatives such as mechanized soil tillage. An outstanding example is that of southwestern Brazilian Amazon, where government-owned tractors are accessed mainly via borrowing by grassroots associations, but also via tractor service supplied by local governments. The economic feasibility of the policy was appraised with a discrete choice experiment and a critical examination of implementation issues was pursued based in a qualitative survey. The results attested that policy was efficient strictly with association-based administration and without banning fires. Nevertheless, efficient tractor subsidy was justified as an enhancement of smallholders' welfare but not strictly as compensation for a reduced right to burn. That the policy changes offered were seen as better than the absence of change was probably due to complimentary public services, such as road infrastructure, been perceived as insufficient. Two extra tractor hours per farm were enough to ensure acceptance of a half month delay in the fire season opening. In complement, practical policy failures were observed, including tractor maintenance cost fitting neither associations nor government budgets, associations lacking social capital, providing tractors in a more costly basis and not being capable to enforce contracts for hiring pilots. The attested inefficiency of a near ban on fires parallels failures of similarly severe constraints attempted in multiple developing countries and it may also harm the livelihoods of smallholders. Conclusively, although mechanized tillage is not a fast way towards a large replacement of agricultural fires, it is nevertheless recommendable if improved in its implementation and planned for a time horizon comprising many years. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - CONTEXT: The demand for beef in Indonesia has increased over the last decade; however, national production barely meets half of the domestic demand. This gap creates an opportunity for beef smallholder farmers to improve their livelihoods by increasing their participation in the domestic market. Innovation is central to supporting smallholder farmers to benefit from this increase in beef demand in Indonesia. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to analyse the barriers to the innovation system in the Indonesian beef sector in the province of Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB) to identify opportunities to increase smallholder beef productivity. METHODS: In the analysis, we applied the agricultural innovation system (AIS) framework to identify constraints for boosting beef production in the province. We used qualitative data (in-depth interviews and focus group discussions) collected in NTB and data from a literature review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed significant constraints across all AIS functions that ultimately translated to poor innovation in the beef sector in NTB. The results showed that the beef innovation system is constrained by multiple factors, including the lack of farmers' professionalisation, lack of agricultural R&D investments, underdeveloped beef value chain, and lack of incentives for PPPs. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings inform policy in NTB and increase smallholder beef productivity. Additionally, the findings point to constraints that are likely common in beef production in many developing countries, and that could be considered when developing policy in other areas in Indonesia. © 2022

AB  - Agricultural commercialization has been promoted as a pathway for enhancing household welfare in developing countries. This paper assesses the extent and determinants of commercialization among smallholder potato farming households in Nyandarua County, Kenya. Data were collected through a survey of 388 potato-producing households and analysed using a crop commercialization index (calculated as a share of the value of produced potato that is marketed) and the Tobit regression model. The average commercialization index was 0.4, implying that only a smaller share of the produced potato is marketed. The extent of potato commercialization varied across gender, education level, productivity, size of potato plots, and farmers' knowledge of production and marketing. The findings also show that household characteristics (such as gender (being male), age, education of the household head, household income) and transaction costs (such as distance to the market) negatively influenced potato commercialization. Conversely, the scale of potato production, knowledge of potato production and marketing, participation in Farmer Field Business School (FFBS) and group membership were positively associated with potato commercialization. Based on the findings, interventions to strengthen women's empowerment and the institutional arrangements for collective action and extension are encouraged. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Social Ecological System (SES) research highlights the importance of understanding the potential of collective actions, among other factors, when it comes to influencing the transformative (re)configuration of agri-food systems in response to global change. Such a response may result in different desired outcomes for those actors who promote collective action, one such outcome being food sovereignty. In this study, we used an SES framework to describe the configuration of local agri-food systems in Andean Ecuador in order to understand which components of the SES interact, and how they support outcomes linked to five food sovereignty goals. Through a survey administered to mestizo and indigenous peasants, we analyze the key role played by the Agroecological Network of Loja (RAL) in transforming the local agri-food system through the implementation of a Participatory Guarantee System (PGS). This study demonstrates that participation in the RAL and PGS increases farmers’ adoption of agroecological practices, as well as their independence from non-traditional food. Additionally, RAL lobbying with the municipality significantly increases households’ on-farm income through access to local markets. Being part of indigenous communities also influences the configuration of the food system, increasing the participation in community work and access to credit and markets, thus positively affecting animal numbers, dairy production and income diversification. The complexity of the interactions described suggests that more research is needed to understand which key factors may foster or prevent the achieving of food sovereignty goals and promote household adaptation amid high uncertainty due to global change. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: This study examined the effect of linking small-scale women farmers to markets, referred to as community marketing, and homestead food production extension services in two districts of rural Bangladesh. Method: We particularly focused on identifying the relationship between treatment and food security, monthly expenditure patterns, and food production and marketing by adopting a doubly robust method that mediated bias from project site selection and potential misspecification of the postulated outcome or treatment model. Results: The main results showed that establishing community marketing sites along with extension services provided women farmers a secured marketing outlet for food production, plausibly associated with a decreased likelihood of a reduction in monthly expenditures on healthcare (12.7 percentage points), child education (19.4 percentage points), and transportation (51.5 percentage points) during the lean season. However, if farmers did not spend extra income generated from marketing on food purchases, it would be difficult to anticipate an improvement in food security. Conclusion: Community marketing was devised to link women smallholders to the markets without conflicting with social and cultural norms for which women were responsive, and our research findings supported the claim that they benefited from community marketing participation. Therefore, government, NGO, or other extension providers looking for a culturally appropriate approach to address women farmers’ limited mobility may consider using or modifying community marketing. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Cocoa contributes immensely to Nigeria’s economy; it is about 40% of agricultural exports and it is the main source of livelihood for over 200,000 rural households. However, its productivity has remained low in recent years compared to other cocoa-producing countries such as Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana. Low cocoa productivity is attributed to many factors, which include lack of access to credit and cooperative services. However, empirical information on the simultaneous impact of credit access and membership of cooperative society on cocoa productivity is still very scanty. This paper aims at evaluating the impacts of access to credit service, cooperative service, and simultaneous access to credit and cooperative services on cocoa productivity in South-western Nigeria. Method: A multistage sampling procedure was employed to select 300 cocoa farmers for the study. The endogenous switching regression (ESRM) and the inverse probability-weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) models were used to analyse the data. Results: In terms of simultaneous access to credit and cooperative services, age, education, gender, and size of household significantly influence the probability of farmers having simultaneous access to credit and cooperative services. The results of the second stage of the ESRM showed that age, size of household, years of education, and years of experience significantly influence cocoa productivity among farmers who have access to credit and cooperative services. However, age, size of household, size of farm and asset significantly influence the productivity of farmers who do not have access to credit and cooperative services. Average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) revealed that farmers who simultaneously have access to credit and cooperative services achieve significantly higher productivity than farmers who have access to either credit or cooperative services and the set of farmers who do not have access to either credit or cooperative services. Conclusion: The study concluded that simultaneous access to credit and cooperative services positively impacted cocoa productivity. Farmers who have simultaneous access to credit and cooperative services achieve significantly higher productivity than farmers who have access to either credit or cooperative services or those that do not have access to these services at all. The study recommends that any agricultural productivity-targeted programmes in Nigeria consider farmers’ simultaneous access to credit and cooperative services. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - It is widely recognized that participation in producer groups is advantageous for smallholders who must deal with complex production and marketing constraints and dynamic business environments. However, available data on this process are scarce in the fishery sector, while existing evidence is limited by smallholders’ potential self-selection into producer groups. This study, therefore, examined the selectivity-corrected role of fisher groups in improving shrimpers’ technological and technical efficiency. Using the latest primary data from artisan shrimpers in Nigeria, we applied propensity score matching and Greene’s selectivity stochastic production frontier model to control for selection bias from both observable and unobservable factors. Empirical results from our metafrontier approach show that technical efficiency scores for members tend to be overestimated if selectivity is not properly controlled. However, the technical efficiencies and productivities of members were significantly higher regardless of how biases were corrected, implying that participation in fisher groups is positively related to increases in shrimpers’ capture and technical efficiency. Further findings suggest that current artisanal fisher groups are “production-oriented” as they ensure that members access vital shrimping inputs at lower costs. With declining returns to scale for members, the study concludes that without public and private support for collective action in the fishery sector, membership in artisanal fisher groups may not lead to significant improvement in shrimpers’ productivity. The study discusses several recommendations on how collective action can be further encouraged and developed among artisan fishers. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Many studies show that participation in contract farming has positive impacts on farm productivity and incomes. Most of the literature, however, does not take into account that contracts vary in their specifications, making empirical evidence scarce on the diverse impacts of different types of contracts. In this study, we investigate the driving forces of participation in marketing and production contracts, relative to spot markets. We also study the extent to which different contract types add additional benefits to smallholder farmers, using recent survey data of 389 cashew farmers in Ghana. To account for selection bias arising from observed and unobserved factors, we apply a multinomial endogenous switching regression method and implement a counterfactual analysis. The empirical results demonstrate that farmers who participate in production contracts obtain significantly higher cashew yields, cashew net revenues, and are more food secure compared to spot market farmers. We also find substantial heterogeneity in the impact of marketing and production contracts across scale of operation. Small sized farms that participate in production contracts tend to benefit the most. Marketing contracts, however, do not appear to benefit cashew farmers. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Although organic rice is a niche market in Pakistan, it has exhibited enormous potential for growth in export-oriented production. Since contract farming is the leading promoter of export-oriented organic rice production in Punjab, Pakistan, improving the technical efficiency of smallholder rice farmers through contract farming holds sufficient potential. This work examines the influence of contract farming participation on smallholder rice farmers’ technical efficiency using a cross-sectional data set of 650 respondents. We applied a stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to examine the production frontier and inefficiency estimates. Further, propensity score matching (PSM) was used to control endogeneity and self-selection bias in technical efficiency estimates. The results reveal that the technical efficiency score of organic rice farmers in Punjab, Pakistan, is 89.7%, which can still be improved by 10.3% at the current sociodemographic characters and input levels. Likewise, land size, seed, and machine expenditures are the key inputs of the production frontier. Results show a positive and significant connection between contract farming participation and technical efficiency. The study extends the literature on technical efficiency, export-oriented production, contract farming, and the well-being of smallholder farmers. Moreover, the study’s findings provide cues for policies and practices. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Climate change is negatively affecting agricultural production in the Sahel region. Climate-Smart Agricultural Technologies (CSATs) are disseminated to reduce these negative effects, and particularly those on resource-poor farm households. This article investigates the distributional impacts of the adoption of CSAT on-farm households’ welfare using a dataset that covers four regions, 32 communes, 320 villages, and 2240 households in Mali. Using an instrumental variable quantile treatment effects model, the paper addresses the potential endogeneity arising from the selection bias and the heterogeneity of the effect across the quantiles of the outcome variables’ distribution. The results show that the adoption of CSAT is positively associated with improved households’ welfare. The farmers’ decision to adopt any CSAT is influenced by access to credit, contact with extension agents, participation in training, access to information through the television, and being a member of any organization such as a cooperative society. Moreover, the effect of the adoption of CSAT on household welfare varies across the different households. In particular, the results show that the impact of the adoption of CSAT on households’ welfare is generally higher for the poorest (farmers located at the bottom tail of the distribution) end of the welfare distribution. The findings, therefore, highlight the pro-poor impact of the adoption of CSAT in the rural Malian context, as well as the need to tailor the CSAT interventions toward specific socio-economic segments of the rural population in Mali. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The study aims to measure the effectiveness of the project management information system (PMIS) and its impact on financial wellness in rural areas. The study uses DeLone and McLean’s updated information success model to measure the net impacts of the PMIS on the community. The dynamics between the PMIS and financial wellness have not yet been clarified, as the available literature on the concerned domain is very limited; thus, further research is required to report the effect of the PMIS on financial wellness. A total of 628 samples were analyzed from 666 collected through structured questionnaires and stratified sampling from 21 hill blocks from the hills of Uttarakhand. Exploratory-confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis were both conducted using SPSS and AMOS. The study found that PMIS quality, information quality, and service quality are significantly important for the PMIS, and its impact on the net benefits derived from PMIS was studied. The results also reveal that the net benefits of the system impact the financial behavior and financial attitudes of SHGs and cooperative members, consequently significantly impacting financial wellness. This study proposes and tests the information system (IS) financial wellness (FW) model for community-based development programs in the lines of the logical framework approach and the stimulus-organism-response framework. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Farmland environmental pollution has put greater pressure on the sustainability of agricultural production systems. Exploring the relationship between farm size and environmental pollution in agriculture can help provide realistic guidance for stakeholders. In this study, the research data from apple farmers in China were used to measure the environmental pollutant emissions caused by apple production using the life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The mediating effect model was used to examine the mechanisms and pathways by which farm size affects the environmental effects of apple production and to identify the mediating effects of fertilizer, pesticide, and machinery input intensity. Finally, a heterogeneity analysis was conducted to illustrate the impact of participation in agricultural cooperatives on the environmental performance of apple production for smallholder farmers. The results showed that the apple production system’s negative environmental impacts from the agricultural material production phase were more significant compared to the farming phase, with a contribution potential of 56.50%. Farm size directly impacts the environmental effects of apple production, and there is a U-shaped trend between the two, implying that from the perspective of environmental effects, larger farm size is not better. There were some mediating effects in the paths of farm size on the environmental effects, and the largest effect was fertilizer input intensity with a full mediating effect; the second largest effect was machinery input intensity with a partial mediating effect, and the mediating effect accounted for 15.50–15.89% of the total effect; the mediating effect of pesticide input intensity was not significant. In addition, the study also found that joining agricultural cooperatives was beneficial in promoting the improvement of the negative environmental impact caused by apple production. These findings provide insights into optimizing farm inputs for apple production and identifying the appropriate farm size to alleviate multiple environmental impacts, intending to make a marginal contribution to promoting sustainable development of the apple industry in China also providing the research evidence for the comparative study of the environmental burdens of apple production in China and other countries in the world. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The southwestern part of Nigeria, particularly Ogun State, is more vulnerable to the vagaries of climate change due to the high dependence on rain-fed agriculture and limited capacities to respond to climate change. In this study, factors influencing climate change adaptation strategies and its impacts on household food security of smallholder rice farmers in Ogun State were estimated. A multistage sampling technique was employed to select 120 smallholder rice farmers in the study area. The factors influencing the adoption of climate change adaptation practices and their impacts on household food security among smallholder rice farmers in Ogun State were examined using a probit model and an endogenous switching probit model (ESPM). According to the results of household dietary diversity score (HDDS), adopters of climate change adaptation techniques have higher levels of food security than non-adopters. The outcome of the ESPM shows that access to market information, access to extension agents, gender, off-farm income, and membership in cooperatives all contribute to the variations in food security experienced by both adopters and non-adopters of climate change adaptation strategies. A unit increase in adoption of climate change adaptation measures will increase household food security by about 3 units while decreasing severity in food insecurity by about 3.2 units. Therefore, it is recommended that policies that would support smallholder farmers’ decisions to embrace measures for coping with climate change should be encouraged in order to stimulate their adaptive capacity. Additionally, in order to secure the inclusive sustainability of the agricultural sector, stakeholders and NGOs must collaborate with each other to enhance the circumstances under which farmers may receive climate change information, timely agricultural loans, and policy incentives. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Over the years, the Ugandan government had been promoting agricultural commercialization to become a middle-income economy by 2020. In 2012, the president remarked that if all the 40 million acres of arable land were put to full potential, everyone would be richer. Sugarcane commercialization, in the form of contract farming, has been praised as one of the preferred instruments to promote it, leading to the emergence of large and medium sugar corporations in Uganda's countryside. The study aims to provide insights into the commercialization process of smallholder agriculture through sugarcane contract farming (CF) and the implications on land rights, labor relations, and rural livelihoods, taking Uganda's Bunyoro sub-region as a case. To achieve this objective, the study used a qualitative approach and carried out in-depth interviews with a total of 75 participants who were directly affected by the actions of the sugar production and or participated in the CF scheme (as outgrowers) as well as factory officials. The findings highlight that the wave of CF schemes around sugar, which was engineered by a convergence of power and interest between the Ugandan state and Indian capital investments, adversely integrates rural farmers into sugar commodity production networks amidst unequal contractual relations, expanding agro-extractivist search for cheap land and labor rather than bringing inclusive rural development. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Malawi is a sub-Saharan African country at the forefront of the contemporary forest landscape restoration movement that places local smallholder farmers and resources users at the center of restoration actions. However, the manifestations of farmer-led bottom-up restoration efforts at individual and collective levels, and how they add up to landscape-scale restoration outcomes remain understudied. We analyze the nature of restoration efforts across interlocked forest and agricultural landscapes, estimate the extent of farmlands under restoration, and examine the contextual drivers and barriers of restoration. We use a mixed-methods approach combining a multivariate Tobit regression model and a Poisson model based on a 2019 household survey (N = 480 households), and qualitative insights from seven focus group discussions from Malawi's Dedza and Ntchisi Districts. The estimated mean total area of restored farmlands per household was 1.10 ( ± 0.76) and 1.07 ( ± 0.72) acres, representing, on average, about 54 % and 43 % of the total household landholdings in Dedza and Ntchisi, respectively. Results also indicate restoration diversification and intensification patterns whereby farmers generally combine two or more land-management practices based on complementarities in achieving specific livelihoods, food security, and ecological goals of restoration, and on compatibility regarding labor and other inputs demand. Land configuration mattered. Land plots that were spatially consolidated and tenure-secured were associated with higher restoration efforts. Also, women restoration efforts are limited by their inadequate access to productive inputs. Therefore, restoration policies should center on strategies that improve land-ownership security while minimizing fragmentation within landholdings and promote gender-responsive interventions. Drivers of collective resources restoration include strong local leadership; perceived tangible benefits for firewood, NTFPs, and timber resources; secure rights to collect firewood and free access to grazing areas; and perceived balanced among payoffs for energy needs, climate change adaptation, and ecological goals. These can inform restoration programs involving collective actions and their governance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Many poor rural households depend on products from non-cultivated environments for subsistence and commercialization. Collective action schemes, such as community-based natural resource management (CBNRM), aim at maintaining natural resource quality and thus potentially contribute to the sustainability of environmental income sources. Little is known about whether and under which contextual conditions these schemes effectively promote environmental income generation or imply trade-offs between wildlife conservation and socioeconomic development. We rely on a unique combination of original farm-household data with a rich set of spatiotemporal covariates to quantify environmental income and dependency in Namibia's Zambezi region at the heart of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area. We then estimate the effect of CBNRM on environmental income and dependency in a quasi-experimental regression-based approach. Controlling for historical variables that affected selection into formal CBNRM schemes, we further explore the role of contextual variation in exposure to tourism activity. Results suggest that CBNRM fosters livelihood strategies that are, on average, more dependent on the environment. However, this effect is driven by outcomes of households that live in close proximity to touristic enterprises, where such livelihood strategies align better with other income generating opportunities than in areas where agriculture represents the only viable economic alternative. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - A growing literature uses least-cost diets to evaluate how effectively a food system supports access to nutritious foods. We identify the cost of meeting nutrient requirements for whole households in rural Malawi from and the nutrient-level drivers thereof. From 2013 to 2017, we can identify a household least-cost diet only 60% of the time with an average cost of $2.32/person/day (2011 US$ PPP). We illustrate that larger households have more diverse nutrient needs and face a higher cost for 1000 calories of a sufficiently nutrient dense diet. Shadow price analysis shows riboflavin to be the costliest nutrient in the market. We use policy scenarios to understand what drives the infeasibility and high cost. Simulating the impact of selenium soil biofortification of maize results in a feasible diet 94% of the time at half the cost ($1.22/person/day on average) and eliminates the shadow price of copper. This is explained by insufficient selenium from sources low in copper such that under baseline conditions it is impossible to get enough selenium without too much copper. Even when feasible, to avoid copper, more higher cost foods enter the diet than would be otherwise needed to meet remaining nutrient requirements. Other value chain scenarios to increase the availability and lower the cost of nutrient-dense foods did not meaningfully change the diet cost results. Of direct relevance to Malawi, this study demonstrates more broadly how least-cost diet methods can be used to assess barriers to accessing an adequate diet and the potential impacts of policy options. © 2022 The Author

AB  - In the digital economy era, as a new production factor, digital technology can break through the information blocking constraints on farmers’ behavior, become an important driving force affecting farmers’ low-carbon production behavior, and provide new opportunities for agricultural green low-carbon transformation and the realization of carbon emission peak and carbon neutrality goals. Based on the field survey data of 571 farm households in Jiangsu Province, China, this paper employs the Ordered Probit model and the mediating effect test method, and takes risk cognition as the mediating variable to empirically analyze the impact of digital technology use on farmers’ low-carbon production behavior and its path. The study results show that environmental risk cognition, health risk cognition, agricultural product safety risk cognition, and pesticide residue risk cognition have a significant positive impact on farmers’ low-carbon production behavior. Study findings also reveal that, on one side, the use of digital technology has a direct effect on the farmers’ low-carbon production behavior, on the other side, it indirectly affects the farmers’ low-carbon production behavior by affecting their risk cognition, that is, risk cognition plays a partial mediation role in this relationship. Furthermore, the results indicate that among the control variables, joint cooperative membership, food security knowledge, agricultural income, technical guidance, and following instructions have a significant and positive impact on farmers’ low-carbon production behavior. Based on study findings, the variable “number of the labor force” has a negative and significant impact on farmers’ low-carbon production behavior. Based on study findings, to effectively realize carbon emission peak and carbon neutrality goals and promote sustainable and high-quality agriculture development, agricultural policy makers should pay attention to the role of digital technology to actively promote low-carbon production behavior.

AB  - Generally, agricultural production involves several challenges. In the drylands, it is further complicated by weather-related risks and resource degradation. In this paper, we present a case study of the mixed crop-livestock production system in Jordan. To better capture the nature of response farming in the drylands, we develop a methodology for using crop simulation models to directly generate data for optimizing production practices of an integrated crop-livestock producing household in a dynamic stochastic context. The approach optimizes producer’s adaptations to random events, such as weather, which are realized throughout the planning horizon. To ensure the sustainability of the optimized production decisions, long-term valuations of end of horizon soil attributes are included in the objective function. This approach endogenizes the tradeoff between short-and long-run productivity. Model results show that due to the limited natural resource endowments and financial liquidity constraints of the typical farm households in the study area, we find these households have limited options. To optimally respond to weather conditions during the production season, better manage risk, and achieve improvements in soil attributes, a typical household would need larger farm size, larger flock, and better financial liquidity than it currently commands. Like all such models, the farm household model used in this paper is not suitable for drawing policy implications. Therefore, targeted analysis using appropriate sectoral or economy-wide models will be needed in the future to identify and test the efficacy of different policy and institutional interventions including land consolidation, establishment of producer and marketing cooperatives, access to financial services including agricultural credit, and crop insurance in expanding the resource base of farmers—thereby positioning them for higher earnings, ensuring soil conservation, and enhancing the sustainability of the production system.

AB  - Background: Financial risk-sharing through community-based health insurance is a critical component of universal health coverage. However, its development is a great challenge, not only due to low enrollment but also due to the high dropout rate of members from the program, which threatens its sustainability. So far, the few existing studies in this area have focused on household enrollment into community-based health insurance, rather than on the number of members dropping out. This study aims to identify factors influencing households to drop out of community-based health insurance membership in rural districts of the Gurage Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based case-control study was carried out from May to July 2021. Supplemented by qualitative focus group discussions. Multi-stage sampling was employed. An interviewer-administered prearranged tool was used for collecting data. Epi-data version 3.1 and SPSS version 21 were used for data entry and analysis. The association between factor and outcome variable was determined using binary logistic regression analysis at p < 0.05 and 95% CI. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically and triangulated. Results: From 525 (175 cases and 350 controls) rural household heads 171 cases and 342 controls responded, yielding a response rate of 97.7%. Of those, 73.1 and 69.0% were males in cases and controls, respectively. The statistically significant influencing factors associated with dropout from community-based health insurance were: highest wealth status (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.14–4.87), unfavorable attitude toward CBHI (AOR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.87–3.37), no illness experienced in the last 3 months (AOR: 5.21, 95% CI: 2.90–9.33). no frequent health facility visits (AOR:5.03, 95% CI:1.17–23.43), no exposure to indigenous community insurance (AOR:0.10, 95% CI: 0.03–0.37), not graduated in the model household (AOR: 3.20, 95% CI:1.75–5.83), being a member in the program for more than 3 years (AOR:0.55, 95% CI: 0.29–0.94), not trusting governing bodies (AOR:10.52, 95% CI:4.70–23.53), the ordered drug was not available in the contractual facility (AOR:14.62, 95% CI:5.37–39.83), waiting time was >3 h (AOR:4.26, 95% CI:1.70–10.66), and poor perception of service quality (AOR:12.38, 95%CI:2.46–62.24). Conclusion: The findings of this study illustrated various factors which positively and negatively influenced households to drop out from CBHI: wealth status, attitude toward CBHI, perceived poor provider attitude toward CBHI members, illness experience in the household, the experience of frequent health facility visits, model household graduation status, trust on CBHI committee (governing bodies), availability of a prescribed drug in the contractual health facility, waiting time and perceived quality of health service from the contractual facility, exposure to any of the indigenous insurance (IDIR and/or IQUB) and length of membership in program. We strongly recommend all responsible stakeholders give strong attention to promoting the community, and for providers to project a favorable attitude toward community-based health insurance, to achieve model household graduation, and improve quality of service by addressing the basic quality-related areas like waiting time, and drug availability).

AB  - Along the maize value chain in Ghana are a wide range of risks that confront actors; the risk chain actors' face include production and marketing risks. Accordingly, risk management, which has become an integral part of maize value chain activities, is challenged with several factors, some of which are economic, institutional, social and behavioral factors. This study posits that risk preferences/behavior of farm decision-makers in the maize value chain have empirical importance for economic and policy analysis. Thus, an experimental gambling approach was used to elicit the risk aversion behavior of respondents (farmers). Here, the respondents' risk aversion behavior over varying game levels was investigated. The multinomial logit model was used to investigate endogenous and exogenous factors explaining the risk behavior. The data were obtained by interviewing 220 maize farmers who were sampled with a two-stage sampling procedure. This study revealed that most of the farmers in the study area exhibited risk aversion behavior. About 33% of farmers showed extreme risk aversion behavior at the games’ lowest level and increased to 45% as the game level rose. It was also found that sex, age, level of formal education, access to credit, access to the storage facility, household size, farm size and the number of extension visits to the farm significantly explained the risk aversion behavior the maize farmers exhibited. Because farmers are risk-averse and become more risk-averse as stakes become high, any farm innovations to be introduced to them must be implemented gradually, especially with the low-income farmers. It is also critical to make risk mitigation 'handles' available to farmers so that they can rely on them during times of risk. © 2022 Universitas Sebelas Maret.

AB  - Strengthening linkages with markets along the value chain is a promising pathway to increase agricultural productivity, welfare, and food security of smallholder producers in developing countries. Our study investigates the impact of an integrated value chain project, which linked producer organizations to markets and provided various types of training to their members. Using primary survey data from Nepal, we apply propensity score matching to ensure common support and statistical balance between project (treatment) and non-project (control) households. We implement the selectivity-corrected stochastic production frontier methodology to control for unobservable characteristics and estimate a simulation-based stochastic metafrontier to account for different technological levels between the two groups of households. Comparing results between the translog and Cobb-Douglas production frontiers, we find that the more flexible translog specification shows no signs of selectivity bias while this bias is present with the Cobb-Douglas, motivating the need to correct for selectivity. Our main results from the metafrontier analysis indicate that project impacts are reflected in substantial technological gaps and significant meta-technical efficiency differences in favor of treatment households. Thus, this study shows that strengthening linkages between producers and markets can have a large positive effect on productivity. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that more vulnerable producers, including those with fewer years of education and smaller farms, receive relatively higher returns from the project compared to their counterparts. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Random growing demand for high-quality agri-products raises a pseudo pressure on mass-producing Asian tropical regions and lowers Asian smallholders’ profit. Literature indicates that the Buffer stock operations (BSO) policy performs well in maintaining sustainable profit for smallholder farmers and retailers. However, with the changing market and growing demand, the conventional BSO lacks efficiency in policymaking and incorporates market distortion. The outburst of COVID-19, random market intervention, growing e-commerce portals, and increasing price declination in the physical market have significantly reduced the smallholders’ profit. Thus, this paper modifies the conventional model and proposes a B2B contractual supply chain framework to integrate the BSO model. The supply chain framework considers two different channel leadership strategies, Government Leadership and Farmer Leadership. Following the leadership strategies, this study is concerned with the equilibrium state of the supply chain drivers (the farmer, the retailer, and the government). The proposed framework formulates the model through Stackelberg game modeling and solves using sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium. The theoretical results (Lemmas) ensure that the government leadership strategy facilitates an equilibrium state and sets an optimal profit for farmers and retailers and an optimal social welfare function. Although the farmer's leadership strategy ensures an equilibrium state between the farmer and the retailer, it neither guarantees an equilibrium and optimal state between farmers and government nor an optimal social welfare function. The numerical case illustration considers a wide variety of the market's price sensitivity coefficients. It guides the policy-maker and the supply chain drivers to understand strategy selection better. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Northern Ghana is noted for its significant contribution to the food basket in Ghana. Farmers in the region suffer severely from extreme climatic conditions, with floods among the most devastating disasters. This study uses binary logistic regression model and the Poisson count model to address this threat to food security by analyzing the nexus between flood risk perception and farm households' adoption of flood disaster adaptation strategies in Northern Ghana, including significant factors such as off-farm employment, cooperative memberships, and access to credit. Results indicate that the flood disaster adaptation rate was low among farmers in the region, with only 41% adopting at least one adaptation strategy. Flood disaster risk perception had a significant effect on farm households' preparedness. Farm households with the perception of severe floods, high probability of flood occurrence, sense of worry, and threats to farm inputs and yield from flood disasters were more likely to adopt more strategies to adapt and mitigate flood risks. Additionally, off-farm employment, cooperative membership, access to credit, extension services, household income, and education significantly affected farmers’ flood disaster adaptation behaviour. This study recommends that great attention be shifted towards empowering farm households on flood risk awareness and the fundamental strategies involving on-farm (agronomic practices and farm water distribution) and off-farm practices (off-farm employment and cooperative memberships) to mitigate flood risks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Corporations and independent experts alike consider inclusive agribusiness (IAB) instrumental to achieving sustainable and equitable development for small farmers. As businesses that productively integrate small farmers into commercial agrifood chains, IABs could help resolve some of the coordination and market and input access problems confronting many rural economies. They are therefore increasingly regarded as important private innovations to address systemic inequalities and inefficiencies within modern food systems. This article critically interrogates IAB narratives inspiring recent policy innovations. By reviewing recent IAB literature, discourse and strategies, as well as past IAB scaling experiences, it shows that IAB models such as contract farming and producer cooperatives are liable to discriminatory practices, uneven benefit capture and socio-ecological trade-offs, especially at scale. This article challenges IAB orthodoxies and the unconsidered definitions, big-business biases and value creation assumptions pervading emergent IAB policy discourse. It argues that in order for IABs to contribute to transformational change, the phenomenon deserves to be more explicitly positioned within a sustainable food systems framework. To help move the needle on IAB scholarship and policy, this article reimagines IAB along these lines. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Tobacco production and curing cause a threat to the environment through injudicious use of pesticides, imbalanced use of chemical fertilizers, and excessive consumption of local firewood. Keeping all this in retrospect, this study has been designed to assess the impact of tobacco farming on family workers, and witness on spot involvement of children and nursing/ expecting mothers in tobacco-related health-hazardous tasks. General objective of the study is to document both the positive and negative environmental and socioeconomic externalities of tobacco production in the study area. It is based both on primary data and secondary statistics. Primary data has been collected from sixty farmers for the tobacco season 2021; including forty contract and twenty non-contract sample farmers. Farmers conceive that tobacco farming has a bad impact on human health (93 %), and causes degenerative deforestation and resource depletion (68 % each). Use of Green Tobacco Sickness gloves and Personal Precautionary Equipment was reported by eighty and sixty-two percent of the farmers, respectively. Impact of the disease on the workers’ health was reported by thirty-five percent of contracted farmers, and 90 percent of non-contracted ones. Thus, the impact of the disease on human health was severe on non-contracted farms, mainly due to little or no use of Personal Precautionary Equipment. Cost of Personal Precautionary Equipment per season at the contracted farms was much higher (US$ 18.0) than at non-contracted ones (US$ 2.0). While the treatment cost of Green Tobacco Sickness or other agrochemical-related diseases of contracted farming households was 2.5 times lower than non-contracted ones. As per the results of the double log Ordinary Least Squares regression model about medical treatment cost, the coefficient of age of household head and use of Personal Precautionary Equipment have negative expected signs and are statistically significant. Laboratory tests of soil and water samples have revealed hazardous levels of Sodium Chloride and Dissolved Oxygen in canal water, which indicate imbalanced use of fertilizers by the growers and leaching of excessive nutrients below the root zone. Tobacco companies’ contracted growers were found to have less occupational health hazards. Thus, raising awareness among tobacco growers about the importance of adopting precautionary measures and use of Personal Precautionary Equipment can reduce the negative effects of tobacco farming. © Pakistan Academy of Sciences.

To analyze factors affecting smallholder farmers’ marketing channel choice, we classify four types of channels—Broker Channel, Farmers’ Retailing Channel, Wholesale Market Channel, and Cooperative Channel—and inspect 14 variables based on the survey data of 317 households from four provinces. We use a principal components analysis (PCA) to simplify these 14 variables into seven common factors and a multivariate logit model to study how the factors influence smallholder farmers’ choices. We find that compared with the Broker Channel, the Farmers’ Retailing Channel is mainly affected by the logistics factor, skill factor, risk factor, and size factor; the Wholesale Market Channel is influenced by the logistics factor and age factor; and the Cooperative Channel is mainly influenced by the age factor, logistics factor, and price factor. In conclusion, the logistics factor has a significant positive effect on each channel choice, and the improvement of the market and transportation conditions has a general promoting effect. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In Tajikistan, owning beef cattle is an important survival mechanism for smallholder farmers to alleviate poverty. Therefore, beef cattle farming enterprises should indeed strive to maximize profit to excel and flourish in a free economy. Nevertheless, smallholder beef cattle farmers are known for making little profit. Thus, this study was set to evaluate the profitability of beef cattle farming and its determinants to enhance profit maximization among smallholder beef cattle farmers in the Baljovan District of Khatlon region, Tajikistan. A total of 388 farming households were chosen at random and purposive for the study. The cross-sectional data collected using questionnaires was analyzed by using descriptive, gross margin (GM), and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models. Based on the descriptive analyses, the mean age of beef cattle farmers was 52.73 years, with a household size of 7.07 members. The beef cattle farmers had an average of 18.23 cattle herd size with 8.54 years of farming experience. The average land area possessed by farmers was 10.59 hectares. Among farmers, men (98.2%) dominated beef cattle farming activities. Around 83.8% of farmers had a college grade (higher literacy). Besides, around 89.4% of farmers had access to farm credits. However, only 71.4% of farmers used farm credit points to produce beef cattle. Most of the farmers (89.7%) had access to accurate market information. Such market information enabled 75.8% of farmers to sell their beef cattle to open market (profitable) outlets rather than middlemen. About 89.4% had access to veterinary services. Additionally, about 82.7% of farmers acknowledged the availability of pasture for grazing, which motivated 87.6% of farmers to be involved in selling contracts. Furthermore, economic investigation results revealed that on average, farmers had a gross margin (GM-profit) of 353.77 US$ per cattle, with feed costs (58.6%) and medications costs (26.1%) accounting for the largest share of total variable costs. Meanwhile, the profitability of beef cattle farming among farmers was significantly influenced by education level, family size, farming experience, pasture availability, land size owned, selling contract, feed costs, medications expenses, access to credits, and sales costs (P < 0.05). This study concluded that beef cattle production is a feasible business. However, the potential for increased profitability is significant if existing resources are efficiently coordinated and production expenses, notably feed and healthcare costs, are minimized. Thus, the government should develop additional measures for addressing concerns such as capacity building, suitable and freely available pasture as well as health management, to boost beef cattle profitability among farmers in Tajikistan. © 2022 Jobirov et al.

AB  - What are supply chain management challenges in a lower-income economy, and how do managers at smaller firms address them? This field study presents these challenges from the perspective of the 60 managers who run firms selling irrigation equipment in Senegal. By canvasing 35 cities, we gain unique visibility into how private supply chains, on which public officials and smallholder farmers in Africa rely, effectively deliver agricultural goods. The primary challenges for managers in this supply chain are day-to-day risks that are quality and contractual in nature and have financial implications. City size in combination with supplier type, firm size, and manager network determine risk exposure. Firms’ efforts to manage the chain are more reactive than proactive and more informal than formal, which reveals an opportunity for public agencies to support supplier and customer coordination. Public decision makers should tailor support to account for the differential risks that city size brings to supply chain management. This support should include not just financing the firms directly but should also entail giving loans to customers, certifying suppliers, and sharing inventory risk with public and nonprofit partners. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - To honour the 100 years anniversary of the first publication about African swine fever (ASF) a webinar with a particular focus on disease control in the smallholder sector was organized. This article is based on the webinar, summarizing the early history of ASF research, reflecting on the current global disease situation and bringing forward some suggestions that could contribute towards achieving control of ASF. The first description of ASF by R. Eustace Montgomery in 1921 laid the foundations for what we know about the disease today. Subsequent research confirmed its association with warthogs and soft ticks of the Ornithodoros moubata complex. During the latter half of the 21st century, exponential growth of pig production in Africa has led to a change in the ASF-epidemiology pattern. It is now dominated by a cycle involving domestic pigs and pork with virus spread driven by people. In 2007, a global ASF epidemic started, reaching large parts of Europe, Asia and the Americas. In Europe, this epidemic has primarily affected wild boar. In Asia, wild boar, smallholders and industrialized pig farms have been affected with impact on local, national and international pig value chains. Globally and historically, domestic pigs in smallholder settings are most frequently affected and the main driver of ASF virus transmission. Awaiting a safe and efficacious vaccine, we need to continue focus on other measures, such as biosecurity, for controlling the disease. However, smallholders face specific challenges linked to poverty and other structural factors in implementing biosecurity measures that can prevent spread. Improving biosecurity in the smallholder sector thus remains an important tool for preventing and controlling ASF. In this regard, interdisciplinary research can help to find new ways to promote safe practices, facilitate understanding and embrace smallholders’ perspectives, engage stakeholders and adjust prevention and control policies to improve implementation. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - ‘Sustainable palm oil’ aims to eliminate deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, land conflicts and labour abuses from palm oil global value chains while maintaining palm oil production as a vehicle for development in tropical countries. However, smallholder palm oil growers are a small minority of those who are certified as sustainable and persistently face multiple socio-economic challenges. We analysed 100 journal articles that address smallholders, oil palm and issues related to sustainability in order to critically examine the current state of evidence for sustainability upgrading in smallholder palm oil global value chains. We identify a focus on sustainability certification in the academic research agenda that has left key implementation and knowledge gaps on meeting smallholders’ needs outside of a certification framework. An implication of this is that buyers, policy-makers, and consumers do not recognise both the challenges and advantages of small-scale agriculture for sustainable palm oil. We found that certification standards struggle to resolve persistent smallholder challenges, such as low incomes, low yields and insecure land tenure. Certification appears to be a flawed method to conceptualize and measure the sustainability of smallholders. We, therefore, advocate broadening approaches to studying sustainability and smallholder palm oil production, particularly to target issues that are of immediate concern for smallholder farmers as opposed to prioritising productivity. Future research should take inspiration from diverse established fields of research in defining sustainable practices, such as agroecology or agroforestry. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Many smallholder tree growers in developing countries and those advising them, hold a view that if they plant trees a market will materialize when the time is right. However, despite strong international demand for timber and potential for smallholders to supply this demand, this ‘Field of Dreams’ approach, i.e. if you grow it, buyers will come, is not generally a sound strategy. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that enable the development of viable timber value chains around smallholder tree growers in developing countries. We reviewed literature on the integration of small-scale producers into value chains, smallholder tree growing, and smallholder commercial forestry to identify conditions, and used four case studies in the Asia-Pacific Region to understand how these influence outcomes for smallholder tree growers in different settings. This analysis provided a basis for recommendations for policymakers and advising agencies on how to support timber value chains for smallholder tree growers. These included deeper understanding of biophysical suitability of locations for tree growing, smallholder capabilities and interests, and provision of clear land tenure, infrastructure, and streamlined regulations sympathetic to smallscale timber operations. Tree growing can generate financial value for smallholders in regions with high human population density, quality road networks and proximity to processing markets and ports. Careful policy design is required to make it ‘fit for purpose’ at local levels, as conditions vary widely even within a single country. This can identify catalytic interventions and work with existing or near-term market drivers and simplified regulations in the value chain to generate benefits for smallholders. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Live bird markets (LBMs) provide integral hubs for 95% of poultry produced for food. Surveillance systems in LBMs serving smallholder farmers in sub-saharan Africa are often non-functional, and data about public health risks and emerging pathogens are lacking. Studies in Kenya have reported 29–44% Campylobacter prevalence in poultry. We analysed such LBMs in Kenya for likely transmission of Campylobacter from poultry to humans. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 186 live poultry traders (LPTs) in 14 LBMs in a region with widespread backyard poultry systems. A pretested structured questionnaire was administered to all LPTs having regular contacts with poultry to gather market data and risk information on campylobacteriosis. Campylobacter was detected in individual cloacal cultures and identified through PCR. The median score obtained from the outcome of risk assessment dichotomized respondents into high and low risk categories. We performed logistic regression at 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare market characteristics and Campylobacter positivity to risk categories to identify LBM-associated public health risks. Markets had a median of 13 traders, and mean age of 46.3 ± 13.7 years. Majority 162/186 (87.1%) were males. Market behavioural processes by LPTs varied: Only 58.6% LPTs held bird species separate; onsite slaughter (38.7%); encountered sick-bird (93%) and dead-bird (83%) amidst limited health inspection (31.2%). Campylobacter positivity in live birds was 43/112 (38.4%, 95% CI: 29.4–48.1). Risk information on campylobacteriosis was low 41/114 (36%, 95% CI: 27.2–45.5). Sanitary risks were related to accumulation of litter (adjusted prevalence odds ratio [aPOR]: 19.67, 95% CI: 3.01–128.52). Accessing hand-wash facilities (aPOR:.32, 95% CI:.13–.78) and access to information (aPOR:.24, 95% CI:.09–.61) were protective. Sanitary risks were related to poor hygiene. LBMs could be central surveillance sites for Campylobacter. Public health authorities/actors should consider appropriate targeting to improve sanitary measures and Campylobacter control strategies. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Food security in many developing countries has been threatened by several factors such as unequal land distribution, ineffective land reform policies, inefficient agricultural value chains, and an increasing number of climate disasters. In Nigeria, these threats are exacerbated by rapid population growth and extreme weather events, which have resulted in farmer-herder conflicts in most agrarian communities. This paper examines the differential impacts of the incidence and severity of farmer-herder resource use conflicts on food insecurity of rural households in Nigeria. We employ a two-stage predictor substitution model to estimate survey data collected from 401 rural households in Nigeria. The empirical results show that both the incidence and the severity of farmer-herder conflicts significantly increase food insecurity, and the severity of these conflicts has a larger impact than their incidence. The estimates of the conditional mixed process models confirm the robustness of our results. Additional analysis reveals that the incidence and severity of farmer-herder conflicts positively and significantly affect food insecurity, measured by the number of days with limited varieties of food eaten. Our findings highlight the importance of policy interventions that address ongoing farmer-herder conflicts in affected countries like Nigeria to enhance food security from a sustainable development perspective. ©

AB  - Improving agricultural productivity is a foundational sustainability challenge in the 21st century. Large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) have important effects on both well-being and the environment in the Global South. Their impacts on agricultural productivity and subsequent effects on farm incomes, food-security and the distribution of these outcomes across households remain under-investigated. In particular, prior studies do not sufficiently attend to the mechanistic nature of changes in household agricultural practices that affect LSLA outcomes. To address these challenges, we use a novel household dataset and a quasi-experimental design to estimate household-level changes in agricultural productivity and other LSLA outcomes in Tanzania. We use causal mediation analysis to assess how four common mechanisms—contract farming, land loss, market access and technology adoption around LSLAs—influence agricultural productivity. We find that households near LSLAs exhibit 20.2% (95% CI: 3.1%-37.3%) higher agricultural productivity, primarily due to increased crop prices and farmer selection of high-value crops. Importantly, the direction and magnitude of effect sizes associated with the different mechanisms vary. The presence of contract farming explains 18.1% (95% CI: 0.56%, 47%) of the effect size in agricultural productivity, whereas land loss reduces agricultural productivity by 26.8% (95% CI: −71.3%, −4.0%). Market access and technology adoption explain little to no portion of the effect size on agricultural productivity. Despite higher agricultural productivity mediated by contract farming, we do not find increased household incomes or food security. Plausible explanations include limited market access, higher crop prices restricting food access and elite capture of contract farming concentrating income effects to a few households. Our results stand in contrast to assumptions that technological spillovers occur through LSLAs and are the principal drivers of LSLA-induced agricultural transformation. We find instead that access to contract farming and high-value crops lead to greater agricultural productivity, but also that benefits related to these mechanisms are unequally distributed. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - South–South Cooperation has received significant attention. This article assesses the implications of Brazil’s More Food International on farm-level social organizations in Goromonzi and Mvurwi districts in Zimbabwe. Data was collected using mainly focus group discussions, key-informant interviews, and the application of a questionnaire among 410 farming households. Differentiated implications and outcomes were observed between the two districts. Overall, the Brazilian programs improved access to tractor and irrigation implements. Still, the implements were more suited to the large-scale production systems rather than to those of the small-scale A1 farmers. Furthermore, a top-down approach utilized by the state has adverse consequences. The prerequisite of forming cooperatives before accessing the tractors and irrigation implements disrupted local political and socio-economic organizations already in existence within the two districts. The study concludes that, while farm mechanization is crucial for agricultural production, the exclusion of the farmers during policy conceptualization undermines the success of these programs. © 2022 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Microfinance is thought to be an effective tool for empowering women. Yet, previous studies that evaluate microfinance programs have mixed findings. This is in part because there are large variations in the interventions that are evaluated, but also that there is not a standardized metric of empowerment that is implemented consistently throughout the literature. This study investigates the effectiveness of a joint United Nations program aimed at empowering rural women through women-run rural savings and credit cooperatives in Oromia, Ethiopia, using the project-Women's Empowerment in Agricultural Index. Building on more than a decade of studies and validation of different versions of the Women's Empowerment in Agricultural Index, the tool aims to provide a standardized and comparable metric of women's empowerment that is flexible enough to measure impacts of development projects. This study finds that the program had a positive impact on intrinsic agency for the beneficiaries with continued access to credit through the RUSACCOs between the baseline and endline. For this group of beneficiaries, the program seemed to increase the trust and respect between spouses. There is a second group of beneficiaries that appeared to have dropped out at the initial stages of the program or lost access to credit, suggesting there may have been problems with the program or possible resistance by spouses or community members. The study expands our understanding of how to measure women's empowerment impacts of development projects within the context of a smallholder agricultural households. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - This study evaluates the impact of adopting improved sesame varieties on farm household food security using the data collected in 2018 from potential sesame-growing districts in northwestern Ethiopia. Selectivity and endogeneity probleSms were addressed by endogenous switching regression and the propensity score matching approach. Thus, we estimated the influence of technology adoption on different food security indicators. Our findings indicate that the adoption of new sesame varieties significantly reduced the propensity of food insecurity through increased food consumption expenditures, improved nutritional food intake (consumption scores), and the probability of food security of a household. The finding supports that there is a positive relationship between cash crops and food security. Access to improved sesame seeds, a cash liquidity advantage, extension service efficiency, and farmers’ networking have a significant and positive effect on the adoption of improved sesame varieties. Hence, development policies should be established to motivate cash crop seed multipliers and research institutes to satisfy the seed demand, improve extension service efficiency, and support rural farmers’ primary cooperative. The study enriches the current debate on the subject and provides new empirical evidence of the synergy between cash crops and food security. © 2021, European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI).

AB  - Over the last 15 years, the agricultural economics and development literature has amply highlighted success stories of smallholder farmers in developing countries, illustrating their increased engagement and integration with markets, in other words, higher rates of commercialisation. Yet, this seeming ‘success’ should not detract from the large proportion of farmers who, through engaging in high-value market chains, face high risks that often limit the extent of their engagement. This study, across four African contexts in Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, strives to better understand smallholder participation in agricultural commercialisation. Using new detailed cross-sectional household-level data, from the Agricultural Policy Research in Africa (APRA) consortium, collected over 2017–2018, we analyse assets as a determining factor for localised patterns smallholder commercialisation. Applying asset-based thresholds, we capture commercialisation ‘capacity’—an indicator of the household’s commercialisation potential and ability to respond to risks. Despite the possibility to increase commercialisation as well as institutional arrangements that may reduce risk, such as contract farming, benefits from linkages with medium-scale farmers or returns from specific crop types, we find that households may yet be constrained by lower capacity. Hence, the need for targeted support for those at the margins and with limited assets; with the most pronounced and significant constraints for lower capacity households in study areas in Tanzania. These results can better inform development policies for agriculture where it is important to be able to specifically target households rather than a one size fits all approach. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Vegetatively propagated crops are particularly prone to disease dissemination through their seed systems. Strict phytosanitary measures are important to limit the impact of diseases as illustrated by the potato seed system in Europe. Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) is a devastating disease caused by two viral species collectively named cassava brown streak viruses (CBSVs). CBSD can cause substantial root yield losses of up to 100% in the worst affected areas and is easily transmitted through stem cuttings. In Eastern and Central Africa, the epidemiology of CBSVs in the local socio-economical context of production remains poorly known while a better understanding would be an asset to properly manage the disease. This lack of information explains partially the limited efficiency of current regulatory schemes in increasing the availability of quality seed to smallholders and mitigating the spread of pests and diseases. This study surveyed the epidemiology of CBSVs in Uvira territory, Eastern D.R. Congo, and its drivers using a multivariate approach combining farmer’s interview, field observation, sampling and molecular detection of CBSVs. Investigation on the epidemiology of CBSD revealed that three clusters in the study area could be identified using five most significant factors: (i) symptoms incidence, (ii) number of whiteflies, (iii) types of foliar symptoms, (iv) cutting’s pathways and (v) plant age. Among the three clusters identified, one proved to be potentially interesting for seed multiplication activities since the disease pressure was the lowest. Through risk assessment, we also identified several key socio-economic determinants on disease epidemy: (i) factors related to farmer’s knowledge and awareness (knowledge of cassava pests and diseases, knowledge of management practices, support from extension services and management strategies applied), (ii) factors related to the geographical location of farmer’s fields (proximity to borders, proximity to town, distance to acquire cuttings), as well as (iii) the pathways used to acquire cuttings.

AB  - In many West African river basins, households regularly experience floods and the associated impacts. In the absence of widely accessible formal risk transfer mechanisms (e.g., insurance), households often have to cope with financial impacts. Only a few studies have explored the financial effects of floods on agriculture-dependent households in the region and the role formal and informal risk transfer plays in their mitigation. This study addresses this gap, explores flood impacts with financial implications for households, and researches the existing strategies to mitigate them. Moreover, it aims to better understand how different measures influence the recovery process. The study draws on primary data from a household survey (n = 744) in the Lower Mono River basin, combined with stakeholder workshops and semi-structured interviews, and applies a generalized linear model to the survey data. The results reveal four flood impact types with financial implications: agricultural, material, health, and trade. Moreover, a shortened recovery time is significantly associated with assistance from savings groups and cooperatives—groups originally not formed to help during floods. In light of the severe and frequent flood impacts, effective and publicly accepted adaptation measures are needed to enable favorable conditions for creating sustainable and accessible risk transfer mechanisms. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Tea smallholders form a significant part of the global tea industry. They support the rural economy in several tea-producing regions in the world. However, their limited role in the tea value chain and numerous other issues pose major challenges to promote sustainability in the smallholders' tea sector. Of late, it has been observed that the adoption of organic cultivation has encouraged some of the tea smallholders to involve in the processing and marketing of tea, enabling the development of an alternative value chain. Based on the premise that value chain development is crucial to improve the smallholders' situation, we follow a mixed methods research approach to draw upon the recent developments in the tea sub-sector in Assam, India. The findings indicate the potential for the development of sustainable and inclusive value chain for the tea smallholders. However, such progress would requisite encouraging more growers to participate in the value chain, and mobilizing and organizing them towards collective actions through suitable institutional arrangements like producer organizations. Further, policy measures focusing on better governance of the smallholders' collectives, building trust, and creating value networks through strategic collaboration would be crucial to empower the growers and promote sustainability in the smallholders' tea production sector. © 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Sheep production in South Africa has experienced some growth though very slow, and as such production cannot meet demand in the local market. This study aimed to determine the factor influencing the competitiveness of smallholder sheep farmers’ and constraints faced by sheep farmers in South Africa. A farm-level cross-sectional data of 217 smallholder livestock farmers in South Africa were used to identify the factors influencing the competitiveness of smallholder sheep farmers in South Africa. The Porter's Diamond Model Framework was used to measure the competitiveness of sheep production in the study areas and principal component analysis was applied to assess the constraints faced by sheep farmers. The study results found that smallholder sheep farmers in the study area are faced with numerous production constraints, which inhibit their productivity and competitiveness. The most severe constraints include marketing, stock theft, lack of capital, diseases and parasite, and high feed cost. The study suggest that smallholder sheep farmers in the study areas can be competitive and experience growth through the creation of agribusiness enabling environments by promoting policies and strategies that will boost investments in sheep production across the value chain. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - The need for establishing the emerging pollutants for various rural households has witnessed a paradigm-shift towards health-related issues. Low-income groups have inadvertently contributed to environmental degradation due to improper hygienic conditions. In this paper, statistical analysis on gathered data from regional households in Karnataka has been evaluated for the health status of the individuals. A selected area based on village patterns was presented with a sample questionnaire in order to gather the patterns of household conditions prevailing in the area. A broad categorization based on the Fuzzy C clustering approach has classifiers in the form of demographic and socio-economic responses, water supply factors, sanitation, indoor air pollution, and solid waste management approaches. For each of the categories, the emerging pollutant has been identified which collectively points to ‘Poverty’ being the primary cause of deteriorating household conditions among people in such rural areas. The results of the questionnaire indicated a strong correlation between the prevalence of pollution and ill health in the low-income category of people. The authors opine that this investigation would contribute to the Government initiative of the Swachh Bharat Mission. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The diseconomies of scale found in smallholders’ agricultural production is a common problem faced by global agricultural development. Notable examples of regions in which this occurs include Central and Eastern Europe, India, Brazil, and China. Smallholders usually differ in their demands for socialized agricultural services due to scattered farmland, various soil conditions, different selections of crop varieties, and diverse farming arrangements. Such differences make it difficult for smallholders to cooperate on farmland scale management, resulting in a collective action dilemma. Based on the Institutional Analysis and Development framework, this paper provides insights into the influencing factors and effects of smallholders’ utilization of socialized agricultural services and constructs a cooperative mechanism for the purpose of solving the collective action dilemma in rural areas of China. We found that household characteristics, biophysical conditions, attributes of community, and rules-in-use jointly generate the action situation in the process of smallholders’ cooperative utilization of agricultural socialized services. Among them, the rules-inuse not only have a direct impact on the action situation but also regulate the role of the other three sets of factors. Various factors and mechanisms affecting the cooperative utilization of socialized agricultural services by smallholders interact in the action arena and finally form relevant outcomes that can deal with the diseconomies of farmland fragmentation. These outcomes will be fed back to each external variable again along the feedback path, so as to promote the system and create a virtuous circle. This study provides a theoretical contribution to understanding smallholders’ cooperation in the process of agricultural large-scale operation, especially in regions and countries with a large number of smallholders. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - An erosion of indigenous and traditional foods in the Global South has dramatically changed the global food system in the last 50 years. Reinvigorating these crops and the agro-biodiversity that they represent could provide benefits for healthier and more sustainable food systems. In South Africa, it has been proposed that studying indigenous plants more extensively and focussing on innovation to include them as mainstream foods on people's plates could improve food and nutrition security. With this background, this paper aims to contribute to addressing this challenge by researching sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) to identify the opportunities for innovating around sorghum as a healthy food and resilient crop. The paper traces sorghum through various encounters across the South African food system. The results point at clear areas where policy interventions could bolster the sorghum value chain. These include zero-rating VAT on sorghum products, investing more extensively in research and marketing across diverse stakeholders, raising awareness about the health benefits of sorghum and using public procurement as a way of instigating a market for novel sorghum products. The outcomes of a successful sorghum innovation programme could improve smallholder farmers' livelihoods, make a healthy food more accessible to South Africans and develop a local market for innovative products that utilize a crop that is resilient to projected climatic changes.

AB  - The transition from subsistence to commercial production poses uncertainty and risks that require putting in place adaptive systems. Such systems are imperative for agricultural production where weather and food markets are always changing. Disregarding risk factors has a cumulative negative impact on the intended outcomes. The marginality of smallholder farmers’ operational environment renders them limited to strive without government interventions. Research has proven that smallholder farmers face numerous challenges in vegetable value chains. The study sought to identify and characterise smallholder growers risk factors when producing for this value chain. A sequential mixed-method research design was adopted, and data collected from fifty-eight growers from three producer groups in the Manzini and Hhohho regions. Discriminant analysis validated the heterogeneity of respondents using the experience on risk factors. The growers were significantly affected by market and production risks. The clustered growers had a high probability of losses in the value of the harvest whereas the private growers had a high probability of yield changes. Fruit size and postharvest handling contributed to changes in the value of the harvest. An improved cold chain system could enable symmetry in the harvest scheduling and grade information as well as prompt payments. Interventions toward enabling access and use of quality farm inputs would curb yield variations. Future research could quantify yield losses at each stage of postharvest handling toward informing the risk management strategy. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The overall objective of this paper is to assess the impact of a value chain development project – the AVCPO in the Bale region (Oromia, Ethiopia) – on smallholder households focusing on the relationship between the food security goal (SDG2) and other SDG-related outcomes such as education (SDG4) and collective action and social capital (SDG16). Possible co-benefits and synergies among the SDGs are explored using a variety of approaches ranging from instrument variable techniques to evaluate the project overall impact on the various SDGs, multi-valued treatment effect analysis to assess which project component is more effective in achieving the expected impacts, and causal mediation modelling to evaluate to what extent collective action and social capital can play a role in achieving food security and education. Our study shows that the aggregate impact is positive and significant on most of the considered outcomes, namely food security (SDG2) except diet diversification, education (SDG4) of girls but not of boys, and collective action (SDG16), while social capital (SDG16) is significant only as far as horizontal relationships within the community are created. Disentangling the aggregate impact, we show that combined treatments (e.g. training plus storage facilities and marketing through cooperatives) generally return larger impacts than stand-alone treatments (e.g. training only). Finally, our study finds that collective action (SDG16) is an important channel that favors food security improvement (SDG2) but only to a lesser extent better education (SDG4). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper aims to assess young farmers' willingness to adopt sustainable agriculture (SA) by implementing the expanded theory of planned behavior (TPB) within the northern region of Bangladesh. The outcomes attained specified that attitudes toward SA, perceived behavior control and perceived self-identity have progressive and fundamental impacts on adoption behavior and affect farmers' intentions to adopt SA's particular production mechanism. On the other hand, the social interface view toward SA is not significantly associated with the Bangladeshi farmer's adoption intention. The results also show that interconnections between social and familial pressure are not significant for sustainable farming practice adoption intentions. However, the interconnections among the psychosocial factors have a crucial role in formulating the TPB to forecast the intentional behavior for adopting SA practices. Thus, the government should highlight the advantages of several sustainable agricultural practices and circulate more detailed information regarding SA tactics to improve the knowledge gap of smallholder farmers. Furthermore, training facilities should be extended to improve the attitude and perceived self-identity of young farmers. Moreover, the formulation of structural information sharing platforms and agricultural value chain facilities should also help shape young farmers' interpersonal behavior in adopting SA practices.

AB  - According to FAO figures, over 129 million hectares of forests have been lost globally since the 1990s, mainly in the tropical Global South, where agriculture acts as the main driver of forest conversion. International commitments, such as the Bonn Challenge, aim to reverse this trend through the application of forest landscape restoration (FLR) as an integrated and inclusive restoration approach. Beyond the discourse level, however, FLR implementation lags behind expectations due to insufficient funding and a disconnection with local implementation. We argue that, instead of relying on public resources for conservation-driven restoration, increased private sector engagement may point the way out of the funding impasse. However, this requires a shift towards production-driven FLR, which includes the livelihood needs of communities and smallholders as agents of landscape transition. For achieving the dual purpose of connecting landscapes with markets and promoting sustainable landscape restoration, we ascribe value chains and their economic, social and ecological configurations a key role in production-driven FLR. Drawing on Vietnam’s forest restoration pathway as an illustrative case, we examine how production-driven forest restoration, smallholder engagement and value chain upgrading can stimulate positive landscape transitions. We conclude that, depending on their configuration, value chains can have negative or positive social and ecological impacts at the landscape level. Furthermore, regulated, progressive and high-value commodity chains may perform better in the areas of integrated FLR objectives landscape integrity, ecological functionality and human well-being. © 2022 by Forest and Society.

AB  - Efforts to improve cacao value chains often assume that production of fine and flavor varieties will raise smallholder incomes. Undertaking postharvest practices of fermentation and drying is another exercise assumed to increase value-added capture by smallholder producers. This study employs household data from 340 cacao farms in 15 villages in coastal Ecuador during 2018 to empirically assess these assumptions. Contrary to the common belief of the international development community, we find that the production of fine and flavor cacao varieties has no association with the price received by small-scale producers. This is mainly due to (i) low productivity and (ii) nonexistent price premiums. Findings also suggest that the use of postharvest practices of fermentation and drying may lead to substantial price responses irrespective of the type of variety grown. The results presented here have implications for program interventions aimed at increasing farmer revenue. Programs promoting the use of fine and flavor varieties alone might be misguided and can be improved by training in modern processing techniques, regardless of the variety produced. [EconLit Citations: O12, Q01, Q12, Q13]. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - In Côte d’Ivoire, the low participation of smallholder farmers in the credit market remains a matter of concern. This study examines the key determinants of rice farmers’ participation in the credit market. We use a Multinomial Conditional Logit model to consider the characteristics related to the use of different credit sources. A total of 588 rice farmers were randomly sampled from seven rice areas. Our findings reveal that gender, age, education level, experience in rice farming, rice plot size, lowland rice farming, extension contact, membership of a farmer-based organization, marketing of paddy rice, and off-farm income significantly influence the use of different credit sources. While credit requirements such as saving plus collateral, kinship/friendship, membership, favoured client, loan maturity, and the distance between borrowers and lenders are credit source-specific variables that significantly determine rice farmers’ choices between different credit sources. These empirical results show that in addition to farmer-specific variables, policymakers should consider the characteristics of credit sources for developing a credit market suitable for smallholder farmers. © 2022 SAGE Publications.

AB  - We explore how gender relations structure the assertion of formal women's land rights (WLRs), highlighting community-level land governance dynamics under individual and collective tenure arrangements. Contrary to a predominant focus on legal reforms, we document the everyday gendered politics in two Mexican ejidos – a globally renowned land tenure regime, which unifies customary and statutory systems and legally affords women and men equal rights as landowners, land users, and decision-makers. Findings explain when, how, and why female landowners practice their rights and exercise their political powers over their land. Women struggle to translate legal land rights into practical land use and control due to masculinized ejido land management; women continue to be marginalized from masculinist spaces of ejido governance and collective decision-making scenarios. Yet increasing cases of women's leadership in local land management institutions indicates the potential to build critical mass for collective participation in land politics. We encourage further attention to these issues so that the legal attainment of WLRs might be reinforced by more equitable distributions of decision-making, power, and land control. Our contribution addresses a lack of attention to the gendered politics of land control after WLRs have been legally formalized. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Contemporary corporate-led agricultural commodity production has seen profound transformations in rural spaces. This article focuses on soybean production in Paraguay, analysing corporate activity in the productive, commercial and economic dynamics of the soybean market and identifies the impacts of this monoculture on small farmers. Drawing on mixed methods, the research points to high levels of concentration of this market in the hands of a few transnational companies, which control the value chain via contractual relations with farmers. Through a complex set of relations, soybean production has seen smallholder farmers fall into debt and become unable to maintain their activity and migrate to new regions, leasing their land and, in the worst cases, lose both their land and status as farmers. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) contribute to local people’s livelihood in many regions around the world. This article investigates the types of NTFPs collected, processed, and traded in the Arasbaran region of Iran, the roles of these products in household economies, and the potential contribution to rural household economies through the collection, processing, and marketing of NTFPs. Data were collected using household and community surveys as well as through secondary sources on the role of NTFPs within Arasbaran forests in Iran. The main NTFPs harvested by local people were fruits. The fruits from 14 woody species, including trees and shrubs, were harvested by local people. The average share of forest-harvested fruit to household income was 27 percent. The mean annual income derived from the harvest and sale of sumac and reddish blackberry in the sample rural household incomes was USD 1822 and USD 142, respectively. In regard to processing efficiency, plum, cornelian cherry, and sumac exhibited the highest processing efficiency. Better policy support would be needed along the whole value chain, starting with the forest management plans, to include fruit species. In addition, measures to support processing facilities as well as to promote trade and marketing beyond the local area would be highly important to develop the potential of forest fruits and other NTFPs. Besides technical and financial support, measures should include regulatory revisions as well as information, training, and awareness raising. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Smallholder farmers produce over 70% of the world’s food needs. Yet, the socioeconomic conditions of the smallholder farmers are substandard. One of the primary reasons for this unpropitious situation is that they generate modest income by selling their harvest due to the lack of trusted buyers and organized markets. This research explores how technology can enable the trust to reduce transaction-related risks, empowering unknown parties to transact. Blockchain technology has the potential of mitigating transaction-related risks and promoting trust with a tamper-proof history of transactions and automatic execution of smart contracts. Based on blockchain technology to promote trust, this research has discovered a novel approach for smallholder farmers to conduct exchanges by generating social capital as an individual and using that social capital as collateral for financial exchanges when establishing contracts. This approach empowers farmers to trade smart futures contracts on behalf of the expected harvest at a better rate to receive some cash in advance to be used in the cultivation process to produce a high-quality harvest that attracts better rates. It also enables them to perform aggregated marketing with enhanced market linkages that, in turn, assist in increasing margins made by the farmer. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Lack of adequate number of groundnut farmers' market channels remain long lasting problems in the study area. However, the choice of an appropriate market channel enables farmers to get reasonable profits from groundnut production. This study aimed to identify the existing groundnut market channels and to analyze determinants of channel choice decisions of smallholder groundnut producers in Western Oromia. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 400 sample household heads. Primary data were collected using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire and through key informant interviews using checklists. Multivariate probit (MVP) model was used to analyze determinants of groundnut market channel choices. The model resulted from that level of education, distance from the nearest market, access to market information, cooperative membership, trust in buyers, access to credit, the quantity of groundnut sold, own transport facilities, and access to off/non-farm income affected the probability of households in combination to select collector, wholesaler, retailer, and consumer market channels at different significance levels. The findings of the study suggest that there is a need for all concerned bodies like government to create market linkage between farmers and buyers, provide improved seed and other production inputs while farmers should maximize quantity of groundnut produced through accessing improved seed and other production inputs and market related development bodies should help in organizing farmers’ groundnut cooperatives. Similarly, strengthening micro financial institution to provide credit for groundnut producers is the area where interventions required. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - This paper examines the Marshallian inefficiency hypothesis of share tenancy system in agriculture of Odisha, Eastern India. It examines the hypothesis from a different perspective where it is argued that a secured land tenure system enhances farm efficiency even though it is sharecropping. We develop three hypotheses within the profit maximization framework and use the efficiency scores of paddy growers computed from the data envelop analysis (DEA) to verify them empirically. The ‘latent variable regression model’ results reveal that a secured land ownership status significantly augments farm efficiency. But the nature of tenancy contract (sharecropping and fixed-rent tenancy) makes no difference in farm efficiency. The policy implication of the study calls for tenancy reform in Odisha agriculture to make the tenancy a more secure one. Currently, the government of Odisha has banned the share tenancy. But a vast concealed tenancy comprising of marginal farmers and landless cultivators is in place. So any reform in this regard would benefit them directly. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Small farm size and fragmented land are considered constraining agricultural development. This study uses the Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey 2016 (VHLSS 2016) dataset to measure the technical efficiency of rice smallholders and its determinants, including farm size, in the Mekong Delta. Data envelopment analysis was employed to examine efficiency scores in the first stage based on data of 506 paddy farms. The overall efficiency calculated through slack-based measure was low at 0.59 and the input slacks were quite large. This indicated that local farmers have not been using their resources efficiently in producing paddy. Further, farms smaller than 2 ha faced low overall efficiency at 54% and higher slacks in terms of all input types. The second-stage Tobit result showed that all types of efficiency could be improved if farmers expanded their farm size and reduced the over-use of inputs. Thus, enabling small farms to achieve economies of scale through collective farming in the Large Field Model (LFM) will be critical for upgrading production efficiency and reducing slacks as labor costs rise and natural resources are constrained. It is recommended that farmers should follow strictly eco-friendly farming packages in order to reduce their current excessive usage of seed cost by 28 USD/ha, pesticides by 61 USD/ha, and fertilizers by 155 kg/ha to reach efficient production frontier. The government needs to take measures to replicate and closely monitor climate smart agriculture programs in large-scale production to improve the overall efficiency of paddy sector, in addition to the important goal of protecting the environment and natural resources of the region.

We employ an innovative two-stage predictor substitution model combined with an unconditional quantile regression model to address the endogeneity of the cooperative membership variable and analyze data collected from 626 banana farmers in China. Results, in general, show that cooperative membership improves banana farm financial performance. Particularly, we show that cooperative membership affects net returns and ROI positively and significantly across the selected unconditional quantiles, with the highest impact occurring at the highest 80th quantile. Cooperative membership also has a positive and significant impact on the profit margin for all quantiles (except for the 20th quantile), but the larger impacts occurring at the lower quantiles. © 2021 Edgard Milhaud Foundation.

AB  - Participation of smallholder Cavendish banana farmers in contract farming in the Philippines started with the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law. Multinational and large domestic companies which used to manage their corporate farms had to transfer ownership of lands to the farmers who used to work in these corporate farms. Various contractual arrangements had emerged to engage farmers for these companies to continue their foothold in the export markets where Philippines ranks second. However, some of these arrangements were deemed inequitable that resulted to side-selling and the emergence of spot markets. Participating in contracts or selling in the spot market has corresponding implications to profit generation. Therefore, exploring what influences contract participation of farmers and its role in improving their profit became highly relevant. As such, this paper aimed to examine the factors that affect the decision of farmers to contract or sell in spot market and explore which arrangement yields better profit. Data collected from 187 respondents were analyzed using a probit regression model. Results show that education, farming experience, and credit/financial support significantly affect contract farming participation. The results highlighted the importance of technical skills and knowledge, and financial support in making decisions such as contract participation. Results also show that contract farmers earn higher profits than non-contract farmers which may imply contract farming to be better. Due to the controversies surrounding contract farming, effective mechanisms to regulate contracts are among the recommendations to ensure the welfare of the farmers. © 2021, NAAS (National Academy of Agricultural Sciences).

AB  - Governments and donors often promote farmer organizations (FOs) in the implementation of their agricultural development programs. Yet, there is a lot of uncertainty whether externally supported FOs provide benefits beyond the channelling of programs. This paper uses Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and representative data from 4,074 Zambian households to estimate FO impacts on members, with and without controlling for a national input-subsidy program. The results show that Zambian FOs tend to attract better-educated households with larger farm sizes, but can lead to female integration when external subsidies are involved. FOs also have a significantly positive effect on members’ farm performance, irrespective of whether members receive input subsidies, while the presence of the external program leads to an unequal distribution of benefits within the FOs: positive impacts on farm performance are, on average 13–44% lower amongst members who do not benefit from the Zambian government program. Overall, these findings imply that Zambian FOs seem to provide benefits that go beyond the intention of the subsidy-program, which can be used to promote women empowerment and smallholder farm performance. The findings also demonstrate, however, that governments need to carefully design their programs to not reinforce inequality amongst farmer organizations and their members. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Land Shareholding Cooperatives (LSCs) centralize management over fragmented farmland by converting farmers' plots into shares. While these cooperatives have been widely successful in boosting agricultural commercialization among rural smallholders in China, their potential has not yet been recognized in the African context. To fill this gap, we present and discuss a theoretical framework based on recent literature, an in-depth case study from Uganda and quantitative analyses of data on horticultural cooperatives from Senegal and agricultural and livestock cooperatives from Uganda, Malawi, Madagascar, Rwanda and Kenya. We uncover the existence of cooperatives built on land sharing schemes in different parts of Africa and especially in Rwanda. We find that these LSCs are more likely to mobilize collective marketing and have a higher business-membership ratio than traditional cooperatives, and we derive a few implications for policymaking. © 2021 Edgard Milhaud Foundation

AB  - We undertook a gendered value chain analysis of marine finfish cage farming in Cambodia, interviewing 50 farmers and 11 other value chain participants, focussing on one of the key social concerns: inclusivity. The study used a modified participatory value chain mapping approach starting with the production/farming unit (household or a small producer company) and then ‘snowballing’ up and down the value chain. We specifically targeted participation of women, youths and minorities. The results showed that women and men were represented equally in several value chain nodes, namely: farmers, farm materials suppliers, and traders with special orders. Middle-aged men predominated as wholesalers and fingerlings traders, while women were predominant as ‘trash’ fish traders and local market traders of farmed fish. Only men, of all ages, were reported as fishers for the ‘trash’ fish supply. Youths of both sexes were present in feed (fishing or trading) nodes, and several of the local market traders were young women. In terms of the farming and the farm materials nodes, youths were present as offspring who were in the process of taking over the business over from the parents. This appears to be one of the few opportunities for youths to enter marine finfish cage farming, because the cost of farm establishment and selection of suitable farming sites were identified as barriers to entry to this industry. We found that most farms were perceived as being family owned, in contrast to literature reports that mariculture farmers as predominantly men. Our findings reinforce that information on inclusivity in aquaculture value chains is essential to planning any interventions aimed at improving returns and increasing efficiency. © 2021

AB  - Five years after the implementation of the tourism precision poverty alleviation strategy, how effective it has been in alleviating poverty remains to be tested. This study, through a study of 241 farm households in 10 national tourism poverty alleviation key villages in the Qinba Mountain region of Hanzhong, southern Shaanxi, finds that rural tourism has contributed to a general increase in farm household income, but the effect of income increase varies significantly between households that have escaped poverty and non-poor households, and there is no significant difference in income between those who participate in tourism and those who do not. The study concludes that the poverty-reducing effects of tourism are conditional, with the poor quality of human capital being the main obstacle to farm households’ income growth, the institutional mechanism for tourism participation is inadequate, effective farm household tourism participation is significantly low, and non-farm work constitutes a substitute for farm households’ tourism livelihood options. The primary stage tourism scenic spots have a limited role in driving the income of farming households, and the geographical location limits the effective participation of farming households. Accordingly, the following countermeasures are proposed: (1) in terms of strategic decision-making options, establish a screening mechanism for tourism participation in poverty alleviation and implement diversified poverty governance; (2) in terms of tourism development strategies, encourage the integration of multiple industries and synergistic development, realize the two-way interaction of “+ tourism” and “tourism +”; (3) in terms of development methods, adhere to the participatory development path, improve the institutional mechanism for tourism participation, stimulate the endogenous motivation of farmers, and explore the dynamic participation path of “bottom-up”. (4) In the development of endogenous power, strengthen skills training, improve the comprehensive quality of farmers and their participation level and ability; (5) In the coordination and protection, play the coordinating and leading role of grass-roots party building, and continuously cultivate and strengthen tourism cooperative organizations. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Forest products have become scarce for local communities in the Philippines. After decades of severe deforestation, a net gain in forest area has only been observed in recent years for the first time. This paper seeks to broaden the understanding of forest livelihood relationships at the turning point of a forest transition trajectory. Based on 993 household surveys from 10 distinct research sites, we use Hierarchical Cluster Analysis to identify six distinct livelihood strategies (LS): remittances-based, livestock-based, crop farming-based, business-oriented, natural resource-based, and wage-based strategies. The highest number of households belongs to the wage-based cluster, which also shows the highest total income. Forest-related incomes only account for small shares of total income for the vast majority of households, although most households collect limited quantities of forest products for domestic use. Nevertheless, one cluster, which includes 12.4% of the sample, generates the largest shares of their income from extractive activities like harvesting forest products and fishing. The households relying most strongly on natural resources in our study sites are also the ones with the lowest total income. Our finding implies that future reforestation policies have to put a special focus on incorporating livelihood benefits for local communities. This should go beyond short-term payments for activities such as tree planting and enable the rural households to derive long-term impacts for human well-being and poverty alleviation. Because most of the forest products reported by our surveyed households were collected for domestic use, they did not contribute much to total household income. This indicates a potential for improving rural income, if forest-product value chains at the smallholder level are improved by future policy interventions. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The Gran Chaco is currently a global hotspot of deforestation and environmental degradation. Halting global warming and curbing biodiversity losses are urgent priorities and recent research suggests that sustainable smallholder production systems could contribute to maintain and restore key ecosystem services. This article examines the adoption of two silvopastoral practices in Argentina's Gran Chaco. We conducted a survey of 552 smallholders in three municipalities in the province of Salta. With the resulting data, we used multilevel models to assess adoption of the two practices. Our multilevel models indicate several factors that are associated with adoption, including: gender of the household head, year of establishment, literacy of the household head, membership in a producer organization, and socio-economic status. Our results suggest that paraje – groups of neighbouring households or joint settlements – are a good predictor of adoption, whereas nearby villages are only marginally associated with adoption. We conclude by highlighting the importance of accounting for local structures and groups of households in rural studies. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Biofuels have been promoted as a renewable energy option in many countries, but have also faced extensive scrutiny over their sustainability. Food security is perhaps the most debated sustainability impact of biofuels, especially in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa that experience high rates of malnutrition and have been a major destination for biofuel-related investments. This study assesses the local food security impacts of engagement in biofuel crop production using a consistent protocol between multiple crops and sites. We use standardized metrics of food security related to dietary diversity and perceptions of hunger, and focus on feedstock smallholders and plantation workers in four operational projects: a large-scale jatropha plantation (Mozambique), a smallholder-based jatropha project (Malawi) and two hybrid sugarcane projects (Malawi, Eswatini). Collectively these reflect the main feedstocks, modes of production and land use transitions related to biofuel projects in Sub-Sahara Africa. Inverse Probability Weighting analysis indicates that involvement in sugarcane production improved household food security for plantation workers and feedstock smallholders. Conversely, involvement in jatropha production does not have a statistically significant positive effect on household food security for both workers and smallholders. Regression models indicate that the factors driving food security indicator levels vary between study sites. Wealth indicators influence food security indicators in several sites, but the absolute level of income plays a smaller role, while income stability/regularity, access to credit and stable markets for selling sugarcane be important drivers as indicated by the strong effect of proxy variables on indicators. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigated the effects of voluntary cooperativisationas conducted by the Community-Based Dairy Veterinary Foundation (CDVF) on the livelihood capital of smallholder dairy farmers. An essential part of this cooperativisation was the provision of community-based paid extension service to the farmers by the cooperative. The sustainable livelihood approach was used to analyse livelihood capital. A simple random sampling technique was used to gather data from 255 respondents: including 15key informant interviews, 5 focus group discussions and 5 case studies. Almost all of the farmers felt that the paid service was profitable. Equal portion of farmers realised moderate (49.80%) and high gains (50.20%) from CDVF. Most significant improvements occurred in physical, financial and human capital resources. CDVF has increased production, and improved farmer-to-market linkage maximised profit and income. Farmers reinvested their improved income in physical assets development. Farmers gained considerable knowledge, skill, employment, voice, intensified social networks, green homesteads and livelihood security from the CDVF services. The complementary effect of all five forms of livelihood capital strengthened the assets pentagon of the participating farmers. Regression results affirm that gender, education, distance from CDVF centre, amount of extension communication, increased milk production and higher income are the determinants of farmers’ improved assets base. CDVF needs to professionalise its management and corporate strategy, and their successful voluntary cooperativisation model needs to be promoted and encouraged by all including the State. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Soil fertility decline is a serious global problem, leading to a decline in crop yields and jeopardizing household food security, particularly in developing countries. This paper examines the impact of socioeconomic and institutional factors and the adoption of sustainable land management practices on soil fertility changes on farms between 2002 and 2018 in the Mahottari District of Nepal. A household survey among 184 smallholder farmers was conducted in 2018 to complement soil survey data collected in 2002. A seemingly unrelated regression model was used to estimate factors influencing soil fertility changes between the two periods. The results showed that soil organic matter (SOM), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and soil pH increased, on average, by about 0.2%, 97 kg/ha, 4 kg/ha, and 0.5 scales, respectively, on the studied farms. The regression results indicated that extension visits and government support (free seedlings) had positive effects, while cooperative membership negatively affected soil fertility changes. Moreover, practicing fallow land use improved soil fertility changes on farms, while practicing conventional tillage using animals deteriorated soil fertility changes. The adoption of agroforestry practices positively affected changes in P and K and negatively affected SOM. Overall, this study highlighted the importance of institutional characteristics and sustainable land management practices to improve soil fertility. The policy implications of these findings for enhancing soil fertility on smallholder farms are: (1) increase the frequency of extension visits to share relevant information with farmers; and (2) incentivize farmers to adopt agroforestry and fallowing practices on their farms. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Fish is a key source of income, food, and nutrition in Zambia, although unlike in the past, capture fisheries no longer meet the national demand for fish. Supply shortfalls created an opportunity to develop the aquaculture sector in Zambia, which is now one of the largest producers of farmed fish (Tilapia spp.) on the continent. In its present form, the aquaculture sector exhibits a dichotomy. It comprises, on the one hand, a smallholder sector that mainly produces for and supplies within local markets, and on the other hand, a burgeoning larger-scale commercial sector consisting of a small number of pioneering lead firms who are (re)shaping how the value chain supplies domestic, mainly urban, markets. A notable challenge confronting the development of the aquaculture value chain in Zambia is ensuring that the larger-scale commercial sector can continue to grow and generate economic benefits for the country, while simultaneously safeguarding inclusive and sustainable growth of smallholder production systems. An in-depth, mixed-methods aquaculture value chain study was carried out in Zambia in 2017 that aimed at providing relevant stakeholders with pertinent information on the value chain's contribution to economic growth and its inclusiveness, as well as its social and environmental sustainability aspects. In this article, we present some key findings from the study to shed light on how the sustainability of smallholder production systems could be enhanced while preserving the growth trend of larger producers in an inclusive way. The study found that the value chain is contributing positively towards economic growth in the country. Smallholder farmers classified as “semi-subsistence” and “commercial” face several albeit somewhat different constraints to production, thus influencing their “sustainability” status. Semi-subsistence smallholders achieve positive (yet negligible) profit margins, and their production system is not environmentally sustainable and the value chain that supports them performs sub-optimally on several social markers. The “commercial” smallholder system is more economically viable and environmentally sustainable. The study juxtaposes these findings with those from the analysis of larger pond and cage-based systems to point to a set of key options Government, research, and development organisations could consider to support smallholder farmers and enhance the sustainability of the semi-subsistence smallholder production system in particular, without overlooking the whole system. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of mobile Internet adoption on technology adoption extensity. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses cross-sectional data collected in 2018 from 932 smallholder litchi farmers in Guangdong Province and Guangxi Province in southern China. A Poisson regression with endogenous treatment effects (ETPR) model is applied to estimate the effects of mobile Internet adoption on technology adoption extensity. Findings: The ETPR model results indicate that mobile Internet adoption can significantly enhance technology adoption extensity. In addition, the extensity of technology adoption is also determined by education level, training, share of litchi farming income, guidebook use and cooperative membership. Disaggregated analyses further confirm the positive impact of mobile Internet adoption on the number of capital- and labor-intensive technologies adopted. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature on agricultural technology adoption. The findings highlight the need to facilitate modern agricultural technology penetration by promoting the use of mobile Internet technologies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Due to climate change and variability, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent worldwide, causing significant reductions in agricultural production and food security. The livelihoods of smallholder farmers, especially those eking out a living by farming on sandy soils, are particularly affected. We examined this issue using the case of Makueni County, a semi-arid area with sandy soils in south-eastern Kenya. Using survey data from 202 households, we examined extreme weather events affecting smallholder farmers and current management strategies used to mitigate the consequences. We then performed field experiments to assess potential gains of implementing sub-surface water retention technology (SWRT) in the region. Finally, we held group discussions with stakeholders in food value chains (FVC) to identify ways of managing climate risks to smallholder farmers. Analysis of the survey data showed that 199 of 202 farmers surveyed had experienced an extreme event associated with climate change and variability during the previous five years. Of these 199 farmers, 161 reported having changed their farming practices to adapt, especially to drought (70%) and increased temperature (22%). Common adaptation practices included early planting, reducing the area under cultivation, and water harvesting. In the field experiments, using SWRT resulted in a 50, 100, 150, and 170% increase in maize grain yield, cob numbers, cob weight, and maize stover biomass, respectively, compared with the control (without SWRT). Stakeholder group discussions along the FVC demonstrated a need for synergy among actors to mitigate climate risks caused by extreme weather events. These findings suggest that diversification of management strategies at farm level, combined with external inputs (new technologies, improved seeds, etc.) and services (credit access, learning from peers and professionals), will be instrumental in reducing future climate risks to smallholder farmers. Improving access to viable markets and fostering mutually beneficial linkages with post-harvest processors would add value to farm produce, thus further increasing income and the capacity of smallholder farmers to manage climate risks.

AB  - The adoption of improved technologies in agriculture has been shown to improve incomes, reduce poverty and contribute to rural development in many developing nations. In Togo, the Agricultural Sector Support Project (PASA) assists smallholder farmers in the adoption of the Improved Technology in Traditional Poultry Farming (ITTPF) in rural areas as a means of increasing smallholder incomes. enhancing food security and reducing poverty. However, the adoption rate is currently below expectations, especially given the promise it holds not only from an economic perspective but also from a broad environmental sustainability viewpoint since poultry manure can be used as a necessary input in smallholder farms. In this study. we examine the factors associated with the participation of farmers in PASA for the adoption of ITTPF in Togo. Our analysis covers 400 smallholder households in the 23 districts of Togo and employs Logit model with Probit model as robustness check. We find different socio-economic constraints and enablers of participation in PASA. Particularly, level of education, household size, membership in cooperative societies. hatching rate of eggs, farm size, average annual sale of poultry and self-financing capacity were positively and significantly related to the participation of farmers in PASA. The findings are robust to alternative specifications such as Probit model. Based on the findings, we argue that participation in agricultural innovation and development programs depends on the information accessible to farmers. One medium to improve information access could be agricultural cooperatives and extension services since they provide informal education, training, and access to productive inputs for farming and marketing purposes. Our findings suggest the need for agriculmral policies which promote farmer organizations such as agriculmral cooperatives coupled with effective extension services to enable the adoption of improved agriculmral technologies. © 2022 Istituto Agronomico per l'Oltremare di Firenze.

AB  - There is an emerging body of studies assessing the influence of resilience on household food security in developing countries. Yet no study has systematically analysed this theme in Zimbabwe, an area that we address. Data was collected from 331 randomly selected farm households in four districts of Zimbabwe. Factor analysis was used to compute resilience capacities. Poisson regression was used for model estimations. Assets, market diversity and social capital increased dietary diversity by 7.5%, 3.6% and 2.9% respectively. Interventions that enhance asset accumulation, for example incomegenerating activities, should be promoted. Promoting farmer groups and collective actions are important to strengthen social capital. Adaptive and absorptive capacity increases dietary diversity by 5.9% and 5.4% respectively. Household resilience is positively associated with dietary diversity. The public and private sectors and civil society need to promote interventions that build adaptive, absorptive, and overall resilience capacity of farming households to enhance food security © 2022, African Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The study assessed the variabilities in climate and key factors of rice production in southeastern Nigeria. Trend analysis and spatial interpolation expressed the spatiotemporal variabilities in the climate and rice yield. Copies of the questionnaire were used to assess four hundred and eighty farm households from 12 local government areas. Other analyses included descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and Productivity Index. The farmers’ socioeconomic characteristics show that the majority (62% of them are young males aged between 30-39 years. Over 80% of them were married while about 72% has household sizes between 5-9 persons. A greater proportion (54%) of them generate between N240,000.00 (578 USD) to N480,000.00 (1156 USD) annually. About 96 % have a farming experience above 10 years, while 50% have basic education (primary education). Logistic regression shows that sex (0.02), category of the farmer (0.00), age (0.03) (0.00), educational qualification (0.02) (0.00), membership of cooperative society (0.00), extension workers’ visit (0.03) were the statistically significant determinants of rice productivity in the area. The area experiences significant rising temperatures and declining rainfall. This trend is more obvious in Ebonyi state. Study results acknowledge the necessity of an enabling environment for rice farming through adequate rural infrastructure, improved rice varieties, access to information, and improved government policies, programs, and interventions to accommodate non-ADP rural rice farmers in order to enhance rice production against the unwanted climate changes. © 2022, Centenary University.

AB  - The reintroduction of cooperatives is part of the Georgian government’s new rural development policy, supported by several international donors’ interventions. This paper estimates the impact of small farmers’ participation in new collective actions. We employ farm-level data from 210 Georgian hazelnuts, grapes and honey farmers and use a treatment effects model that accounts for selection bias. We find a positive and significant impact of participation in new groups on farm revenue and net returns. The findings indicate that even though the cooperatives are still young, the government policies and donor interventions already bring some tangible economic benefits to small farmers. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The Filipino agricultural sector is exposed to multiple climatic, economic, and social risks that will likely intensify in the near future. Building agroecological resilience has been proposed to protect small-scale farmers’ livelihoods and improve food security in the context of (unexpected) shocks and disruptions, and slow system changes such as climate change. This paper argues that commons-based seed production, based on collective management and ownership of seeds and varieties, can play a central role in building resilience capacities in smallholder communities. I explore this by applying an indicator-based framework to assess the contribution of the Filipino farmer network Magsasaka at Siyentipiko para sa Pag-unlad ng Agrikultura (MASIPAG) to agroecological resilience. I find that the networks’ commons-based seed governance builds agroecological resilience in various ways. By equipping small-scale farmers with the tools to regain control over seed production and breeding, they become stewards of an actively evolving collection of varieties. The in situ maintenance and development of traditional, open-pollinated varieties and a network of diversified trial and backup farms build up buffering capacities and foster agrobiodiversity and local adaptation. A focus on regionally available natural resources reduces vulnerabilities to external factors. Adaptive capacities are strengthened through a high degree of flexibility and responsiveness achieved by self-organization and polycentric organizational structures. Broad participation, shared learning and spaces for experimentation support the development of farmers’ capacities to respond to diverse challenges. Commons-based approaches to seed governance can thus strengthen agroecological resilience and long-term food security in smallholder agricultural systems. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This study investigates the welfare implications of agri-value chain participation utilizing data collected from 423 smallholder vegetable farmers in northern Ghana. The endogenous switching regression (ESR) model estimates the determinants of agri-value chain participation and their associated impacts on farmers' welfare, measured by household income and consumption expenditure. The ESR model accounts for selectivity bias associated with observed and unobserved factors. We find that agri-value chain participation improves vegetable farmers' welfare. Participation significantly increases household income and consumption expenditure by about 22% and 40%, respectively. Our results also reveal that agri-value chain participation is significantly determined by education, household size, mobile phone ownership, irrigation, farm size, farmer group membership, and extension visits. Variables such as education, access to irrigation, farm size, access to credit, farmer group membership, and extension are the significant determinants of farmers' welfare [EconLit Citations: D24, Q12, Q18]. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Contract farming (CF) is promoted as part of agricultural development policies in many countries. Few literature on CF has considered the animal epidemic risk, which significantly affects the total revenue and the re-distribution between the contract farmers and the enterprise. Using the ten-year nationwide household-level panel data, we investigate the Chinese poultry sector to analyse the inclusiveness of CF. We evaluate the impact of participating in CF on farmers’ income and asset endowments when animal epidemic diseases occur. The results confirm the insurance and discover the special re-distribution function of CF through adjusting product price. CF negatively affects large farmers’ poultry farming income while it could be mitigated during the animal epidemic disease outbreak. Meanwhile, participating in CF has a significant positive effect on small farmers’ assets when diseases occur. However, CF fails to be ‘inclusive’ in the presence of risks. The above positive effect is limited due to overall fewer participation opportunities available to small farmers. Policy implications and suggestions are derived to improve the inclusiveness of CF to small household farmers. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: Outgrower scheme as a contractual agreement between farmers and some funding entities has in recent times found proliferation among resource poor farmers in Ghana, especially in northern Ghana. This contractual arrangement, which involves the provision of farm inputs, and in some cases, technical support by the implementing company and the repayment by farmers with portions of their harvest, is often regarded as an effective way to mutually improve the outcomes of both smallholder farmers and outgrower companies. The study aims to analyse. the level of awareness, nature of input package, determinants of participation and intensity of participation in input credit scheme by smallholder rice farmers in the Mamprugu Moagduri District of Ghana’s North East Region, using the Integrated Water Management and Agriculture Development (IWAD) scheme as a case. Design/methodology/approach: Using a quantitative analytical approach, the study gathers information from 233 randomly selected smallholder rice farmers consisting of 150 participants and 83 non-participants using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, as well as the Tobit model, are the methods used in the analysis. Findings: The results show that while factors such as age, marital status, number of dependents and farming experience only influenced participation in the scheme, religion, age, sex, number of dependents and farming experience influenced intensity of participation. Originality/value: This study calls for the adoption of sustainable approaches by input credit companies in their credit support to smallholder farmers rather than the current ad hoc support during each cropping season. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Smallholder livestock farmers routinely use existing communication networks as their information sources. This study explored these information sources, the frequency of contacts, and perceived usefulness of livestock health-related information received from these sources. Respondents were randomly selected from two farming districts in the Free State province. Using a mix of descriptive and correlation analyses, it categorized respondents according to their total information scores (TISs) and explored the relationship between their scores and socioeconomic characteristics. Findings show that 65% of farmers scored a high reliance on fellow farmers and extension officials. Mass media sources such as radio and television scored low on perceived usefulness. The correlation coefficients for age (-0.228), farming experience (0.183), extension visits (0.002), and information contacts (0.214) were significant (p < 0.05). Level of education (0.256), herd size (0.067), and perceived usefulness of information contacts (0.252) were also significant (p < 0.01). Gender, household size, income, cooperative participation, and access to financial services were not correlated to the TISs of respondents. It was recommended that mass media sources in the area be supported by extension communication specialists to disseminate livestock health-related information. © 2022 Christopher Ugochukwu Nwafor and Ifeoma Chinyelu Nwafor, published by De Gruyter.

AB  - Smallholder farmers' preferences for participation in contract farming may take the form of proportional data-whereby farmers only sell some proportions or fractions of their output to contractors. We analyze determinants for preferences for zero (potential corner solution) and proportional amounts of milk that farmers sell through contract farming, using dairy farmers' data from Zambia. Bayesian linear, linear probability, and hurdle models are compared with a Bayesian zero-one inflated beta regression. Monte Carlo simulations show that alternative models are biased. Meanwhile, empirical findings suggest that gender and marital status of the household head, household size, and delayed payment significantly drive preferences for proportional milk sales in contract farming. Additionally, household size, experience selling through milk collection centers, total livestock units, access to dairy marketing information, and a buyer's milk price, among others, tend to affect zero-inflated outcomes. We recommend a Bayesian zero-one inflated beta regression model for proportional data and also provide strategies to overcome farmer-engagement barriers in contract farming. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Zimbabwe’s agro-ecological regions IV and V lie in low rainfall areas and food security is a perennial concern. Vertical coordination strategies and market institutions provide hope for building farmer resilience in regions affected by climate change in Zimbabwe. This study focused on four districts (Binga, Chiredzi, Hwange, Matobo) which are in regions IV and V. A questionnaire was used to collect data from 281 respondents. Probit and Multiple linear regression models were used to evaluate the determinants. Results show that contract farmers allocated more than 3 hectares to small grains agricultural enterprise. The research established that long distances to markets, access to credit, extension services and affiliation to farming groups are some critical determinants which influence market participation and yields sold. © 2022, International Journal on Food System Dynamics.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explore the relationship between prudence in risk attitudes and patience of time preference of Chinese apple growers regarding off-farm cold storage of production and marketing in non-harvest seasons. The authors also consider the effect of farmer participation in cooperative-like organizations known as Farm Bases (FBs). Design/methodology/approach: The authors use multiple list methods and elicitation strategies to measure Chinese apple farmers' risk attitudes and time preferences. Because these farmers can either sell their apples immediately to supermarkets or intermediaries or place them in storage, the authors assess correlations between their storage decisions and their preferences regarding risk and time. The authors also differentiate risks involving gains and losses and empirically examine individual risk attitudes in different scenarios. Findings: Marketing decisions are moderately associated with risk attitudes but not time preference. Farmers with memberships in local farmer cooperatives are likely to speculate more in cold storage. Thus, risk aversion behavioral and psychological motives affect farmers' decision-making of cold storage and intertemporal marketing activities. However, membership in cooperatives does not always result in improved income and welfare for farmers. Research limitations/implications: The research confirms that behavioral factors may strongly drive vulnerable smallholder farmers to speculate into storage even under seasonal and uncertain marketing volatility. There is the need to think deeper about the rationale of promoting cooperatives and other agricultural forms, because imposing these without careful consideration can have negative impacts. Originality/value: Do risk and time preferences affect the decision of farmers to utilize storage facilities? This question is important because it is not clear if and how risk preferences affect the tradeoff between consuming today and saving for tomorrow, especially for farmers in developing countries. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Efforts to reduce farmers' market risks and improve buyers' access to farm commodities have encouraged contract farming (CF) in Ghana's cashew sector in recent years. Consequently, the existence of CF shows that farmers who use it may be benefiting from it, as it is their economic responsibility to decide how to sell agricultural products. However, the magnitudes of these benefits or otherwise have been inadequately explored. This paper aims to empirically estimate the impact of CF on farm performance and welfare of smallholder cashew farmers. Design/methodology/approach: The study used probit-two-stage least square (probit-2sls) as a primary estimator to account for self-selection bias and endogeneity that could arise from both observed and unobserved heterogeneities among farming households to estimate the causal effects of CF on farm performance and household welfare. Findings: The results indicated that participation in CF contribute significantly to the gains in farm performance (price margins, yields and net farm revenue) and welfare (consumption expenditure per capita), and that the non-participants of CF would have benefited substantially if they had participated. An analysis of the farm size disaggregated into small, medium and large with regards to the outcome variables produces mixed results. Research limitations/implications: It can be concluded that participating in CF enhances farm performance and household welfare. Originality/value: While many other studies do not account for changes in farm performance and welfare due to differences in farm size or other observed factors, this study fills a crucial void. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The aim is to discuss the role of social capital in alleviating poverty in the rural setting of Africa by viewing it as an individual and collective asset. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use primary data from a survey on rural households living in three different districts in rural Africa. The authors design a social complexity index giving evidence on the poverty alleviation effect of complex patterns of civic participation at district level. Findings: Results support the view that social capital may mitigate poverty only if a rural household simultaneously participates in a plurality of social communities. Such mitigation is reinforced if she also lives in a socially complex district, whereas on the contrary the social complexity of a district, per se, is not enough to alleviate poverty. Originality/value: This paper contributes to advance the knowledge of African rural areas and to identify potential developments of poverty policies in Africa based on diversified social capital as a valuable ingredient for poverty alleviation policies. This paper also contributes to the debate on social capital by showing that diversified social capital has a prevailing individual nature rather than a collective one. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Smallholder farmers are crucial actors for rural development in Africa. Their participation in global agro-food chains assures a source of revenues and agricultural development. Nevertheless, their position is still marginal. Moreover, there is a lack of data about the participation of smallholder farmers in African supply chains. The paper aims to identify the power regime between farmers, processors, middlemen and exporters and analyse how collective actions and external players’ intervention may modify the bargaining power in the sesame value chain in Eastern Chad. The analysis is based on qualitative data gathered from semi-structured interviews with 98 farmers and 41 stakeholders. The study applies a netchain perspective, analysing the vertical relationships along the food chain in terms of power regime and the horizontal relationships of farmers by observing the first impact of collective actions. The results reveal that the dyadic ties are characterised only by supplier and buyer dominance, and there are no relationships characterised by independence and interdependence along the food chain. Especially, farmers suffer from both buyer and supplier dominance. The analysis of the horizontal relationships reveals that only middlemen organise horizontal agreements to improve their benefit in the commercialisation. The introduction of collective actions for farmers improves their horizontal relationships with potential positive impact on the farmers’ vertical relationships along the supply chain. Thus, their bargaining power may be further developed. This study offers a diagnosis of the farmers’ participation in value chain and future perspectives on the collective actions. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Empowering women within sunflower value chains can create significant development opportunities for them and generate benefits for their families. This paper asks whether women’s engagement in sunflower commercialization influences their levels of empowerment. The paper uses data from a 2018 study conducted by Agricultural Policy Research in Africa. A cross-sectional research design was used, and data were collected using mixed methods involving primary, qualitative, and quantitative methods as well as secondary data from the literature. A total of 600 farm household heads and 205 focus group participants (7–15) from 15 villages were selected for the study. Qualitative and quantitative data were subjected to content and econometric analysis respectively, with the help of Microsoft Excel and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences programs. The findings revealed that female household heads tend to benefit less than men from sunflower commercialization. Sunflower commercialization had a positive but insignificant influence on women’s empowerment: the study found that low levels of access to and control over productive resources resulted in low agricultural productivity, which affects empowerment levels. However, household commercialization involving all crops did have a positive and significant impact on the empowerment of women because non-cash crops were more likely to be retained by women, even when commercialized. This calls for policies that support and promote a diversified portfolio of livelihood options for women farmers in Singida region. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper examines how local institutions and family farming labor relations shift and reconfigure in response to The Roundtable on Sustainable Oil Palm (RSPO) certification in Brazil where demanding state regulations exist in a context of uneven enforcement. We use the concept of politics and practice of grounding to explore the Contract Farming (CF) model of Agropalma, the first palm oil export company in Brazil certified with RSPO. Our analysis reveals how the grounding of RSPO's requirement of compliance with applicable domestic laws emerged as a particular point of tension, especially as a result of the CF mechanism. First, despite Agropalma's initial active role in title facilitation, certification made it more difficult for producers to join the CF scheme due to the lack of property titles and their inability to comply with the nominally strict Brazilian environmental regulations. Second, compliance with Brazilian labor protection broke traditional patterns of involving all family members in crop management, and clashes between the company and its outgrowers emerged because of stricter changes in hiring requirements. Our analysis underscores the complex process of reconciling environmental and labor-standard aspirations of Global North certification schemes with the existing legal and enforcement frameworks in the Global South. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Since the early 2000s, the border regions of the Russian Far East have seen rapid growth in large-scale Chinese agriculture through contract-farming arrangements. This article, drawing on archival and ethnographic findings, focuses on contract relations between Chinese agribusinesses and small farmers as a labour regime, unusual in the Russian context. It argues that practices of informal subcontracting, mediation and border governance underlie this regime and produce precarity for small farmers, shifting to them the natural and human risks of agricultural production in Russia. The article points out that managers of large companies used the border to discipline and dispossess direct producers. © 2022 Copyright 2022 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands

AB  - Smallholder tree-growers make substantial contributions to commercial wood flows in many countries in Asia. Many of these growers choose eucalypt and/or acacia species, which offer profitable and sustainable land-use options. Smallholder acacia and eucalypt plantings in India, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Sri Lanka, China, Thailand and Viet Nam are discussed, and data are presented to show the magnitude of these resources. In each country, smallholder plantings form critical raw-material inputs for numerous processors, with the collective scale of their wood production exceeding 86 million m3 annually and worth over USD 2.4 billion annually directly to these growers. Such harvests are major contributors to the livelihoods of smallholder families and to the economic viability of numerous local wood-using industries that rely on the raw materials they generate. This paper describes the profitable partnerships in Asia between smallholder tree-growers and their eucalypts and acacias, discusses their species of choice and the consequences of such decisions, and explores how and why these partnerships have developed and endured. © 2022 Institute of Foresters of Australia (IFA).

We also assess the impact of contract farming on output prices, profitability, and resource usage.We find that technical efficiency is consistently higher among contract farmers than among independent farmers and that significant technology and managerial gaps exist between contracted and independent growers. Ultimately, contract farming intervention benefits the livelihood of smallholders, increases efficiency, and reduces environmental degradation without compromising yield. © 2022 Colorado State University.

AB  - The Cocoa and Forests Initiative (CFI) in Côte d’Ivoire aims to address forest loss associated with cocoa cultivation by reducing deforestation and encouraging agroforestry. This study explores the relationship between certification programs, which operate primarily through cooperatives, and agroforestry to better understand the environment in which smallholder cocoa farmers operate. This study employs qualitative interviews and quantitative survey data to investigate farmer perceptions of certification programs and agroforestry initiatives and the impact of certification on participation in such initiatives. Farmers widely practiced low levels of agroforestry, about which they held generally positive views, and while certified farmers did not have more agroforestry trees, they were more knowledgeable about the benefits to cocoa production than non-certified farmers. Furthermore, many certified farmers conflated certification with cooperative membership. Understanding the role of preexisting institutions like certification and cooperatives is essential for the successful implementation of the CFI in a smallholder context. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this study, we explore the nature of the relationship between smallholder growers and local traders in the coffee value chain in Eastern Uganda. Analysing the results of two lab-in-the-field experiments (trust and dictator games), we highlight the complex relationship between these two value chain actors. We develop three competing hypotheses: (1) coffee growers will send more to fellow growers than local traders due to social identity and fairness motives as well as because of past opportunistic behaviour of traders (2) coffee growers will send more to traders to curry favour, and (3) growers will send growers and traders the same amount because in a relatively competitive market setting there is little room for opportunistic trader behaviour. We fail to reject our third hypothesis. Our results highlight the importance of fully understanding value chain actor relationships and contexts to better design interventions to improve rural markets. © 2022 Oxford Department of International Development.

AB  - This study measured the level of technical efficiency among smallholder ginger growers and examined the determinants of inefficiency by employing the stochastic frontier production function. The paper used a simple random sampling technique to interview 100 ginger farmers in Ilam, a leading ginger-producing district in Nepal, with the help of a pretested interview schedule. The STATA.13 software was used to obtain both stochastic frontier estimates and the determinants of technical inefficiency. The results revealed that the average farm-level technical efficiency is 67.8% which shows the scope of increasing the technical efficiency by 32.2%. The coefficients of seed and farmyard manure were positive and showed significant relation to ginger output at a 1% and 5% level of significance, respectively. Education level, training, and membership in cooperatives had a negative and significant impact on technical inefficiency, whereas areas under ginger production had a positive impact on technical inefficiency. Hence, improving the technical knowledge of farmers through training on optimum input use complemented with motivation to join agriculture cooperatives and farmer's associations may increase the technical efficiency of ginger growers in the study area. © 2022 Dikshya Khatiwada and Pappu Yadav.

AB  - Food insecurity remains one of the major challenges in Ethiopia. There is scanty empirical evidence regarding the contribution of seasonality to household food and nutrition security. This study was conducted in eastern Ethiopia with the aim of examining seasonal household food and nutrition security and factors influencing this seasonal variation. Data were gathered from randomly selected households during pre- and post-harvest seasons. A Random Effects Generalized Least Squares (GLS) regression was employed for analysis. The result indicated considerable variation between the two seasons in terms of dietary diversity and food security. Households producing more food groups, cultivating larger size of land, having higher household income, keeping more livestock, owning cell phone, having access to cooperatives, and having access to improved drinking water as well as education were more likely to be more food secure across seasons. However, households keeping livestock in their dwelling units and households who had access to credit were negatively associated with seasonal food insecurity. Future interventions aiming at ensuring food security should pay attention to seasonality and mechanisms of improving diversified food production and household income as well as expanding education opportunities and access to cooperatives, infrastructure (mobile telephone), and sanitation. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - This study explored factors that determine smallholder farmers’ climate change adaptation practices and their impact on wheat yield in the Lemo district of southern Ethiopia. Focus group discussions and stakeholder consultations were used to supplement survey data collected from 537 wheat smallholder producers. We performed an impact evaluation analysis by combining endogenous switching regression (ESR) with propensity score matching (PSM) model to address the issue of unobserved biases. The study indicates that gender, farmers’ education level, farming experience, cooperative membership, access to extension services, and weather information were significant determinants of smallholder household decisions for climate change adaptation practices. Both ESR and PSM models revealed that smallholder farmers’ adaptation practices significantly enhanced wheat yield by 34.35%. This implies that climate-smart practices adopted by smallholder farmers are vital for improving and sustaining wheat yield. Thus, our findings suggest that policy actions should consider existing smallholder farmers’ knowledge and practices in policy actions aimed at mitigating climate change impacts to sustain agricultural productivity. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Coffee, cashew and avocado are of high socio-economic importance in many tropical smallholder farming systems around the globe. As plantation crops with a long lifespan, their cultivation requires long-term planning. The evaluation of climate change impacts on their biophysical suitability is therefore essential for developing adaptation measures and selecting appropriate varieties or crops. In this study, we modelled the current and future suitability of coffee arabica, cashew and avocado on a global scale based on climatic and soil requirements of the three crops. We used climate outputs of 14 global circulation models based on three emission scenarios to model the future (2050) climate change impacts on the crops both globally and in the main producing countries. For all three crops, climatic factors, mainly long dry seasons, mean temperatures (high and low), low minimum temperatures and annual precipitation (high and low), were more restrictive for the global extent of suitable growing regions than land and soil parameters, which were primarily low soil pH, unfavourable soil texture and steep slopes. We found shifts in suitable growing regions due to climate change with both regions of future expansion and contraction for all crops investigated. Coffee proved to be most vulnerable, with negative climate impacts dominating in all main producing regions. For both cashew and avocado, areas suitable for cultivation are expected to expand globally while in most main producing countries, the areas of highest suitability may decrease. The study reveals that climate change adaptation will be necessary in most major producing regions of all three crops. At high latitudes and high altitudes, however, they may all profit from increasing minimum temperatures. The study presents the first global assessment of climate change impacts on cashew and avocado suitability. Copyright: © 2022 Grüter et al.

AB  - This study was conducted to assess the potential impact of applying a new groundnut planting density on welfare of smallholder farmers in northern Ghana. We used data from on-farm experiments, focus group discussions, and a household survey. We followed three steps in our analysis. First, we conducted cost-benefit analysis in which we showed the economic advantage of the new technology over the farmers' practice. Second, we predicted adoption rates along timeline using the Adoption and Diffusion Outcome Prediction Tool (ADOPT). Third, using the results of the first and the second steps, we estimated the potential impact of the technology on poverty at household level using a combination of methods such as economic surplus model and econometric model. The cost-benefit analysis shows that increasing plant density increases farmers' financial returns i.e., the benefit-cost-ratio increases from 1.05 under farmers' practice to 1.87 under the best plant density option, which is 22 plants/sqm. The adoption prediction analysis shows that the maximum adoption rate for the best practice will be 62% which will take about nine years to reach. At the maximum adoption rate the incidence of extreme poverty will be reduced by about 3.6% if farmers have access to the international groundnut market and by about 2% if they do not have. The intervention will also reduce poverty gap and poverty severity. The results suggest that policy actions which can improve farmers' access to the international market will enhance farmers' welfare more than the situation in which farmers have access to domestic markets only. Furthermore, promoting a more integrated groundnut value-chain can broaden the demand base of the produce resulting in higher and sustainable impact of the technology on the welfare of groundnut producers and beyond. © 2022 Kotu et al.

AB  - The future of food value chains has increasingly been reliant on the wider adoption of sustainable farming practices that include organic agriculture. Organic farming in developed countries is standardized and occupies a niche in agro-food systems. However, such a standard model, when transferred to developing countries, faces difficulty in implementation. This study aims to investigate the factors affecting the expansion of organic agriculture in Lebanon, a Middle Eastern context, and analyzes the economic performance of organic tomato among smallholder farmers. Accordingly, the study was able to determine the production costs, map the organic value chain and assess the profitability of organic tomato by comparing it with the conventional tomato in the same value chain. The study finds organic farming being increasingly expensive primarily due to the inherently high cost of production in Lebanon and the inefficient organization of the organic value chain. As a result, we suggest a blended approach of organic farming with other models, in particular agro-tourism, as a local solution to the sustainability of organic farming in developing countries with limited resources (land and labor) and characterized by long marketing channels. In countries such as Lebanon, a country endowed with rich cultural heritage and natural and beautiful landscapes, the agro-tourism model can harness organic farming and tourism activities. We also propose the adoption of local collective guarantee systems for organic production as a way to alleviate the costs of third-party auditing in Lebanon. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - With the unprecedented feminization of agriculture globally, literature has emerged over the past decade suggesting that gender equality in agriculture could be advanced if gaps in access to farm resources between women and men are reduced. This paper examines gendered farm resource entitlements in northern Ghana. Based mainly on six months of immersive qualitative research, this case study draws from and contributes to feminist political ecology scholarship (FPE) on smallholder farming and agricultural development. The analysis describes some of the intensifying gender and intersecting inequalities (e.g., gender and ethnicity) of land access related to development interventions aimed at commercializing farming. Gender disparities in access to agricultural extension, chemical fertilizers, agrochemicals, high yielding seed varieties, tractor services, credit packages and marketing contracts supported by the state, donors and NGOs are also found. FPE is useful for revealing how these gendered resource disparities are related to agricultural commercialization and increasingly erratic rainfall and aridity, making smallholders more vulnerable to land dispossession. Women’s dependence on men to farm while operating under these changing economic and environmental conditions, coupled with their weaker entitlement rights to resources, threatens to push many, particularly ethnic minority women, out of farming altogether. The ways that intersecting identities shape access to land also complicates understandings of the role of community outsiders who are both the dispossessors of land and those who are intensely vulnerable to dispossession. While rural development studies generally consider women’s farm resources compared to men’s, this does little to explain the intensifying intersectional vulnerabilities. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Food security and environmental protection—led by sustainable agricultural develop-ment—are key development goals of Heilongjiang Province. One of the main challenges facing the Heilongjiang Province is improving soil and livelihood by integrating smallholder farmers into the pilot crop rotation project. This paper investigates a comprehensive project—the new crop rotation pilot project in Heilongjiang (NCRPPH)—which aims to improve the livelihood of the pilot participants by involving smallholder farmers in the pilot crop rotation program and connecting them with the food industry through farmers’ cooperatives. This paper analyzes the impact of the NCRPPH on farmers’ crop rotation, grain yield, multi-agent cooperation, food security, and education based on data collected in 2019 and other retrospective information. The instrumental variable method and three different estimation strategies are used to solve the endogenous problem. The results show that the project has a vast and positive impact on the gross and net value of grain production per hectare and the share of products sold to food manufacturers through cooperatives. Regardless of the farm size, farmers have equal opportunities from which they can benefit. In addition, our analysis shows that the NCRPPH improves the educational situation and food security without affecting crop rotation practices. Finally, our research proves the effectiveness of this project. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - At present, abandoned cropland has become a common phenomenon spreading to countries around the world. China has seen widespread abandoned cropland in recent years. However, there are extremely few empirical studies of cropland abandonment and influencing factors nationwide. In this study, survey data from 8071 farmer households in 14 Chinese provinces were used to analyze the degree of cropland abandonment in China and its spatial distribution. A multi-level model was constructed to quantitatively explore the socioeconomic factors affecting the degree of cropland abandonment, at both the farmer and district/county levels. The results show that: (1) the proportion of farmers and the spatial distribution of abandoned cropland are consistent. (2) Chongqing City, Guangdong Province, and Shanxi Province are high-value areas of abandoned cropland, while Shandong, Liaoning, Henan and Jiangsu provinces are low-value areas. (3) Among the differences in cropland abandonment, 68.5% and 31.5% can be explained at the farmer and district/county level, respectively. (4) At the farmer level, all labor and cropland transfer indicators, including land labor quantity per unit area, male agricultural labor ratio, farmers mainly of middle-aged labor, cropland transfer area and cropland subcontract amount, have significant negative effects on the degree of abandoned cropland. There is a significant negative correlation between the value of agricultural operating fixed assets in the agricultural input indicators and the degree of abandoned cropland, but participation in professional, cooperative, economic, agricultural organizations has no significant impact on the degree of abandoned cropland. The per capita disposable income, which represents the quality of life indicator, has a significant positive impact on the degree of abandoned cropland. (5) At the district/county level, the proportion of the total co-working labor force and the transfer rate of cropland are negatively related to the degree of cropland abandonment, and the proportion of the co-working labor force outside the district/county is positively related to the degree of cropland abandonment. In addition, we briefly analyzed the mechanism and process of cropland abandonment from the perspective of farmers’ decision-making. Finally, the policy suggestions to alleviate the abandonment of cropland were put forward from the district/county and farmer level, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - While it is known that the threat of climatic stresses induces rural smallholders to diversify their livelihood strategies, a consensus has not been reached as to what type of stress induces which strategy, especially in the Mekong Delta Region (MDR) of Vietnam. Primary data were obtained from randomly selected 405 households producing rice (Oryza sativa L.) in three provinces in the MDR. Simpson’s diversity index was used to assess the level of diversification, multivariate probit regression was utilized to examine the factors affecting farmers’ adoption of livelihood strategies, and tobit regression was employed to examine the factors influencing the extent of farmers’ diversification. The index showed relatively low levels of livelihood diversification in the study area. The results of the multivariate probit regression analysis of four livelihood strategies indicated that farmers who were exposed to drought or flood were more likely to cultivate conventional rice varieties than newer cultivars, likely because the newer varieties accessible in the study areas were of the resource-using type that were high-yielding under favorable conditions but susceptible to environmental stresses. Furthermore, those prone to salinity intrusion tended to engage in off-farm income opportunities. In addition, the results of the tobit regression analysis exhibited significant effects of asset endowment, extension services, public transport availability, agricultural inputs, and cooperative membership on the extent of livelihood diversification. To enhance rural livelihoods in the MDR, intervention programs should ensure to provide the resource-saving type of improved varieties as well as promote off-farm employment in salt-affected areas. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Swift response models are vital tools for emergency assistance agencies. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed the lack of economic models for short-run policy relevant research to anticipate local impacts and design effective policy responses. The most direct effects of the pandemic and lockdown tended to be concentrated in urban areas; however, markets quickly transmitted impacts to rural areas as well as among poor and non-poor households. General equilibrium modeling is a tool of choice to capture indirect, spillover effects of exogenous shocks. This article describes an unusual micro general-equilibrium (GE) modeling approach that we developed to quickly simulate impacts of the pandemic and lockdowns on poor and non-poor rural and urban households across sub-Saharan Africa. Monte Carlo bootstrapping was used to construct four stylized regional GE models from 34 existing local economy-wide impact evaluation (LEWIE) models. Simulations revealed that the pandemic and policy responses to curtail its spread were likely to affect rural households at least as severely as urban households. Simulated income losses are greater in poor households in both urban and rural settings. These findings are relatively consistent across models spanning sub-Saharan Africa. Because COVID-19 impacts are so far-reaching, all types of economies experience downturns. Our research underlines the importance of modeling assumptions. We find total annualized impacts of around a 6-percent loss of GDP, smaller than estimates from single-country models that ignore price effects, such as SAM-multiplier models, but in line with The World Bank's baseline forecast of a 5.2% contraction in global GDP in 2020. The largest negative impacts are on poor rural households. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - In the last decade, contract farming has regained momentum among policymakers and global development agencies as a tool to promote inclusive rural development and responsible investments. Integrating smallholders within global, regional and national agricultural value chains, we are told, represents the sine qua non for alleviating rural poverty. In Uganda, under the label of out-grower schemes, contract farming is currently undergoing massive expansion, driven especially by the boom in sugarcane cultivation. Drawing from three case studies of sugarcane contract farming in Uganda, the paper re-politicizes the debate around contract farming by looking at the power relations within which these schemes are embedded. We argue, what is seen in Uganda's expansion is a political dynamic derived both from the major dislocations and dispossessions required to establish the plantation estate and its work force, as well as from the effort to bring many smallholders using unimproved methods on land with sometimes unclear tenure arrangements into contracted arrangements for supplying sugarcane. The result has been highly contentious politics around sugar's expansion, where struggles over land dispossession merge with those around exploitative wage labour, around the loss and transformation of livelihoods, and around debt, power inequalities and environmental harm, a matrix in which state violence and co-optation are ever-present. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Most developing-country farms are small and engage in cooperative agriculture. Prior literature has argued that mechanisms aimed at facilitating smallholder coordination such as cooperatives are central to stimulating market participation. At the same time, cooperatives have not always been able to engage in collective action. In this paper, we conduct neutrally framed coordination games and a natural field experiment to test the effect of cheap talk among members of groundnut-producing cooperatives in Senegal. In both experiments, we ask farmers how much they intend to contribute to the group prior to them actually doing so and then, confidentially reveal aggregate intentions to other cooperative members. Based on survey and administrative data, we find that (1) revealing farmers’ intentions improves collective commercialization and this effect increases with group size and (2) learning in the lab transfers to behavior in the day-to-day environment. Implications for policy and future work are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aims to investigate whether there are gender differences in the livelihood capital of farming households in China. A stratified random sampling technique and household surveys were used to collect data from Dazu District, China. This paper uses capital values to compute the level of livelihood capital, while the ordinary least squares model is employed to compare gender differences in livelihood capital. The results show significant gender differences in farmers’ livelihood capital. Male farmers have more livelihood capital than female farmers. There are also significant gender differences in the factors that affect farmers’ livelihood capital. Education and agricultural cooperatives are the major factors influencing the livelihood capital of men, while agricultural policy support and happiness are the major factors influencing the livelihood capital of women. These results imply that specific gender-based intervention programs should be implemented to maintain farmers’ livelihood sustainability and to overcome gender gaps in agriculture. © 2021 Newcastle University.

AB  - Financial exclusion continues to be a major challenge to smallholder farmers' participation in agricultural value chains in developing countries. Digitizing procurements and other forms of transactions using mobile money technology among value chain actors is essential for ensuring financial inclusion and enhancing agricultural value chain transformation. This study examines the factors influencing the adoption of mobile money technology and the impact of the technology on production input use and farm output, utilizing data from a cross-sectional survey of smallholder rice farmers in northern Ghana. A linear regression with endogenous treatment effects method is employed to account for both observable and unobservable selection bias. The results reveal positive and significant marginal effect of mobile money technology on input use and farm output. Adopters of the technology applied 18% and 13% more fertilizer and herbicides, respectively than nonadopters. The output increased by about 4% for the adopters. The results also show that mobile money technology adoption, input use and farm output are significantly influenced by education, farmer-based organization (FBO) membership, access to credit, input prices, and location fixed effects. Expansion of mobile technology networks, increased investment in education, credit facilities, and FBOs can be quite relevant in promoting the adoption of mobile money technology in Ghana.

AB  - Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) grows in diverse agro-ecological zones. In Kenya, it is widely cultivated in Western and Coastal regions. It is mainly grown for food and nutrition security and excess roots are sold to generate income for the farm households. Its productivity per unit of the land area is high compared to maize and wheat which are staple crops in the country. However, scarcity of cassava planting materials and pests and diseases limit production in these regions. This study aimed at revealing the sources and varieties of cassava planting materials used by farmers and other farmers' practices in coastal Kenya. Four focus group discussions (FGD) and a survey were conducted in 2018, using a semi-structured questionnaire targeting 250 farmers. The data collected on the sources of planting materials, preferred varieties and the practices employed by the farmers in cassava production, was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Majority of farmers (83%) interviewed indicated that they recycled planting materials from the previous crop while some 67% respondents obtained the planting material from their neighbors. Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization's (KALRO) and the local markets were reported as sources of planting materials by 11 and 5% farmer respondents, respectively. The only formal seed source reported was KALRO. The rest, own seed, neighbors, and the local markets, were informal seed sources. Piecemeal harvesting practiced by 98% of the farmers favored planting material recycling. Farmers dedicated a small proportion of their land (mean 0.2 ha) to cassava production as reported by 60 and 72.8% of farmers from Taita Taveta and Kilifi, respectively. Slightly above half (56%) of the farmers in Kilifi dedicated slightly more land to cassava, planting between 100 and 4,000 cuttings (2.5% of an acre up to a full acre) compared to 87% farmers from Taita Taveta who planted 100 cuttings or less (which is about 2.5% of an acre or less). A majority (81.1%) of farmers in Taita Taveta planted local cassava varieties compared to Kilifi's 57.8%. Slightly above half of the farmer respondents reported Kibandameno as the preferred variety followed by Tajirika as the second preferred variety as reported by 18% farmers. Kibandameno was preferred for its sweet taste by 75.6% farmers while Tajirika was preferred by 52.4% farmers because of the high yielding capacity. Nearly all farmer respondents, in Taita Taveta County obtained the planting material from informal seed sources, except a negligible number, who reported buying their planting material from KALRO, a formal seed source, far from their locality. Farmers sourcing cuttings from a formal seed source such as those from Kilifi County were more likely to use a tractor for land preparation compared to those who sourced planting materials informally who more likely had scarce knowledge on cassava production and the value of cassava. Therefore, interventions to establish a sustainable healthy cassava planting materials seed system are needed to address the systemic constraint and help develop a viable cassava value chain.

AB  - The Zimbabwean dairy industry is massively underperforming, as evidenced by a reduction in milk yield from 262 million liters in 1990 to <37 million liters in 2009 and a steady but slow increase to 82 million liters in 2021. The current demand for milk in Zimbabwe stands at 130 million liters, and there is a national capacity for processing 400 million liters per annum. This study used literature, stakeholder inputs and expert knowledge to provide a perspective on practical options to reduce the national milk deficit and, simultaneously, accelerate the transition to a sustainable dairy value chain in Zimbabwe. Following a discussion on the key barriers and constraints to developing the milk value chain, we explored opportunities to improve the performance of the underperforming smallholder and medium-scale dairy farmers. Specifically, we discussed innovative management, creative policy instruments and alternative technological options to maximize milk production in Zimbabwe. We also highlight the need for an inclusive and creatively organized dairy value chain to optimize stakeholder linkages and improve information flow and equity. Examples of crucial investments and incentive structures for upgrading the existing value chain and monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and carbon uptake are discussed. Furthermore, the socio-economic effects (i.e., profitability, women empowerment and employment creation), milk quality, safety and traceability issues linked to a better organized and performing dairy value chain are highlighted.

AB  - Market access plays an important role in increasing smallholder’s income; however, informal markets are typical in developing countries. Traders often dominate agricultural markets. In Vietnam aquaculture, collectors are important actors and act as an intermediary in linking farmers and buyers. This research aimed to explore and analysis the functions and the dominance of collectors in linking with smallholder fish farmers in Tam Giang lagoon, central Vietnam. The qualitative research is applied through 55 semi-structured interviews including smallholder fish farmers, collectors, wholesalers, retailers, officers of local government and second information from statistic data and reports. The research findings showed that linking of smallholder fish farmers to output market has dependence on collectors while all aquatic products have to pass on collectors before distributing to next buyers. Collectors always have strategies to maintain the relationship with smallholders and they always have an advantage status in aquaculture value chain. Collectors are also considered as a barrier of smallholder farmers to access potential marketing channels. Informal transaction and trust are characterized in the interaction between collectors and smallholders. © 2021 University of Craiova, Faculty of Social Sciences, Department of Geography.

AB  - Our ideas and investments for landscape restoration should be broadened to include sustainably managed plantation forestry, especially those owned by small growers in forest-rural landscapes, as a part of the solution. Small growers play seminal roles in tropical forestry; for example, they provide about 90% and 60% of the industrial wood in India and Vietnam, respectively, and are central for countries such as Ethiopia and Uganda. They contribute to restoration of degraded landscapes in large areas. Wood production and use of wood products as a carbon positive, renewable, recyclable material should be a part of climate change mitigation actions. Forestry and wood-based business is providing livelihoods for millions of rural households and probably helping hundreds of thousands of families out of poverty. Tropical countries are facing widening wood supply- demand gaps. Substantial growth of wood production from small-scale plantations via both higher productivity per unit area and carefully managed land expansion, may be the only options for closing this gap. Nevertheless, there is no reliable inventory of the number of small-scale growers and households involved in any tropical country. Similarly, there is a serious lack of attention given to productivity in small -scale plantations, and exploring how sustainable management practices can improve productivity, product value, economic outcomes, and environmental benefits, at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Many projects carried out in the name of small growers within country are fragmented, donor-driven, and uncoordinated. They will be more effective for providing benefits to small-growers if each recipient country developed a holistic and coherent strategy with priorities for advancing small- scale plantation forestry, within which, projects from international groups are harnessed. Creation of a cooperative (public-private), action and impact driven organisation(centre) is proposed. For success, the private sector should engage small growers as co-investing partners for advancing Green-growth and landscape restoration, and thus foster a direct conduit for channelling the global interests in tree-forest based solutions for improving the environment and reducing rural poverty. Small-scale plantation forestry can be substantially strengthened by three opportunities: the growing demand for wood, the role of forests and land restoration in the global carbon cycle and for low-emissions economy, and the urgent need to uplift rural economies and reduce poverty. These challenges are interwoven, and sustainably managed forestry offers integrated solutions for addressing them. © 2021 The Author

AB  - Low soil fertility strongly affects environmental sustainability and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) worldwide. Integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) is a potential remedy for declining soil fertility. We addressed determinants of ISFM technologies and identified the sources of soil fertility information using cluster and ordered probit analyses in two counties of the Central Highlands of Kenya. In Tharaka-Nithi county, the uptake of ISFMclass1 (Animal manure +anti-erosion + inorganic fertilizer +crop rotation + legume intercrop), positively correlated with membership to cooperatives, religious groups, SACCOs, and ownership of wheelbarrow but negatively associated with gender, level of education, low farming experience and increased off-farm income. The uptake of ISFMclass2 (Compost +Tithonia diversifolia +minimum tillage +agroforestry + crop residue retention) significantly correlated with religious group membership and ownership of radio. The uptake of ISFMclass3 (sole green manure) positively correlated with a household with an adult offering outside labor but negatively associated with distance to agro-dealers. In Murang'a, ISFMclass2 (Animal manure +inorganic fertilizer +anti-erosion + legume intercrop) is positively associated with farmers' age, membership to cooperatives, television ownership, and access to handhoe and distance to tarmacked roads. Access to drought power, distance to tarmacked road, and buyers positively correlated with ISFMclass1 (Agroforestry +green manure +minimum tillage +crop residue retention + crop rotation). There was a positive correlation between access to drought power and uptake of ISFMclass3 that combined compost and Tithonia diversifolia. We conclude that the region's uptake of unique ISFM combinations is influenced by socioeconomic, bio-physical determinants, and farmers' perception of soil fertility status. We thus recommend that increased upscaling of uptake of unique combinations of ISFM technologies require robust collaboration among various local development stakeholders to address the prohibitive factors while strengthening enabling ones. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - This paper examines the newly established mineral markets in Tanzania. These markets aim to ensure tax revenue collection and enhance the transparency of mineral trade within the artisanal and small-scale mining sector. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in the Geita Region, we show that the enhanced transparency facilitated by these new markets has benefitted artisanal and small-scale gold miners. However, the living conditions of the miners and opportunities for profit have not changed significantly and the miners do not expect that a more transparent value chain will improve their lives. Many miners continue to depend on sponsorships from more powerful actors, which narrows their ability to profit from transparent market structures. Based on these findings, we discuss the ambiguity of transparency, as its transformative potentials are both important and limited and we argue that transparency for small-scale producers is not a straightforward path towards their empowerment. © 2021

AB  - In Tanzania, diets are dominated by starchy staple crops such as maize, levels of malnutrition are high and largely attributed to lack of dietary diversity. We employed fuzzy cognitive mapping to understand the current soybean, maize and chicken value chains, to highlight stakeholder relationships and to identify entry points for value chain integration to support nutritious diets in Tanzania. The fuzzy cognitive maps were constructed based on information gathered during household interviews with 569 farming households, followed by a participatory workshop with 54 stakeholders involved in the three value chains. We found that the soybean, maize and chicken value chains were interconnected, particularly at the level of the smallholder farming systems and at processing facilities. Smallholder farming households were part of one or more value chains. Chicken feed is an important entry point for integrating the three value chains, as maize and soybean meal are the main sources of energy and protein for chicken. Unlike maize, the utilization of soybean in chicken feed is limited, mainly due to inadequate quality of processing of soybean grain into meal. As a result, the soybean grain produced by smallholders is mainly exported to neighbouring countries for further processing, and soybean meal is imported at relatively high prices. Enhancing local sourcing and adequate processing of soybean, coupled with strengthening the integration of smallholder farmers with other soybean, maize and chicken value chain actors offers an important opportunity to improve access to nutritious diets for local people. Our method revealed the importance of interlinkages that integrate the value chains into a network within domestic markets. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The need for food systems to generate sustainable and equitable benefits for all is a global imperative. However, whilst ample evidence exists linking smallholder farmer coordination and aggregation (i.e. the collective transport and marketing of produce on behalf of multiple farmers) to improved market participation and farmer incomes, the extent to which interventions that aim to improve farmer market engagement may co-develop equitable consumer benefits remains uncertain. This challenge is pertinent to the horticultural systems of South Asia, where the increasing purchasing power of urban consumers, lengthening urban catchments, underdeveloped rural infrastructures and inadequate local demands combine to undermine the delivery of fresh fruits and vegetables to smaller, often rural or semi-rural markets serving nutritionally insecure populations. To this end, we investigate the potential for aggregation to be developed to increase fruit and vegetable delivery to these neglected smaller markets, whilst simultaneously improving farmer returns. Using an innovative system dynamics modelling approach based on an aggregation scheme in Bihar, India, we identify potential trade-offs between outcomes relating to farmers and consumers in smaller local markets. We find that changes to aggregation alone (i.e. scaling-up participation; subsidising small market transportation; mandating quotas for smaller markets) are unable to achieve significant improvements in smaller market delivery without risking reduced farmer participation in aggregation. Contrastingly, combining aggregation with the introduction of market-based cold storage and measures that boost demand improves fruit and vegetable availability significantly in smaller markets, whilst avoiding farmer-facing trade-offs. Critically, our study emphasises the benefits that may be attained from combining multiple nutrition-sensitive market interventions, and stresses the need for policies that narrow the fruit and vegetable cold storage deficits that exist away from more lucrative markets in developing countries. The future pathways and policy options discovered work towards making win–win futures for farmers and disadvantaged consumers a reality. © 2021

AB  - CONTEXT: Myanmar has made rapid economic progress since the country began its transition to a more integrated market economy in the late 2000s. Although these gains are led by positive developments in the agricultural sector, agricultural productivity and profitability are among the lowest in Asia with high rates of poverty especially in rural areas. Small-scale farms dominate rural livelihoods in Myanmar, especially for the 87% of Myanmar's poor who live in rural areas. Hence, these small-scale farms are critical development leverage points as they are an important source of rural incomes to both farm and non-farm households. OBJECTIVE: This study is part of a larger, five-year agricultural research and development project intended to upgrade pork and rice value chains and strengthen rural livelihoods in southern Myanmar's Tanintharyi Region. We evaluated producer-focused interventions to upgrade the pork value chain using tools that consider the dynamic and complex nature of the chain. METHODS: This research used systems thinking and participatory methods to develop a system dynamics model of the pork value chain in southern Myanmar. The model integrated modules of animal production, marketing, investment, finance, and collective action. Scenario analysis with the model guided recommendations for pro-poor interventions for implementation within the five-year development project. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Simulation results indicated that a mix of technical interventions implemented by functional producer groups showed promise in delivering sustained financial benefits to the target community and outperformed the short-term gains generated by these interventions in the absence of collective action. The model also highlighted specific interventions, such as improved financial services, animal health workers, and training that enabled poorer households to benefit from pig livelihoods while reducing risks from environmental and economic shocks. Within complex agri-food systems such as the pork value chain in Tanintharyi, a multi-pronged intervention strategy is recommended to address problems faced by small-scale agribusiness value chain participants. SIGNIFICANCE: Development interventions tend to be implemented in complex environments, often with scarce data to inform decision-making. This research shows how system dynamics tools and spatial group model building processes could help overcome these inherent challenges by creating virtual laboratories where plausible project interventions can be tested and modified, bringing increased confidence to implementation choices. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Foreign direct investment (FDI) facilitates modernization of domestic agri-food systems in emerging economies through increased use of vertical coordination. This paper sheds lights on how international brewer investments in African food systems affect smallholder market participation and value chain development. In particular, we analyze the impact of contracts among malt barley producers in Ethiopia. Using cross-sectional survey data, we employ inverse probability-weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) and propensity score matching (PSM) techniques to analyze the economic impact of contracting. We find that contrary to popular belief, contracting has positive and significant impact on malt barley production, intensification, commercialization, quality improvement, and farm gate prices, ultimately resulting in increased net income and spillover into the productivity of other food crops. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This article aims at examining how supplier contracts with agro firms affect the innovative activity of the suppliers, who are Gambian farmers. Employment and outgrower contracts are considered. In applying the notion of learning, the study elaborates a promising perspective on innovations, understood as changes in the use of technology that correspond to changes in farmers’ level of knowledge. Since information is a critical constraint to farmers’ adoption of new technology, the article tries to contribute to the understanding of social learning. The study is carried out as a multiple case study, allowing in-depth studies of seller buyer relations. Three pathways to innovation emerge from the study, but only one ends with innovation. This difference in ability to alleviate poverty points to a need to get the learning approach into perspective. A briefly introduced holistic perspective shows factors that can explain this difference. Another finding is that innovations are facilitated by contracts in agricultural value chains targeted for industrial policies that educate farmers. Beneficiaries of these policies create learning networks across traditional kinship relationships to take advantage of differences in skills and competences. Policies endorsing price subsidies and tariffs, however, seem to conserve traditional technology. A third result is that uneducated and aging suppliers can behave innovative suggesting that supplier contracts do not discriminate against illiterate, old suppliers. There is no case evidence showing that contracts for employment on industrial farms lead to new skills and knowledge that diffuse and trigger innovations in small-scale independent farms. The recommendations for policymakers are to enable grassroots farmers to innovate by providing industrial policy offering training for farmers, and leveraging social capital to help the development of learning networks and farmer field schools. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Genomic selection has transformed animal and plant breeding in advanced economies globally, resulting in economic, social and environmental benefits worth billions of dollars annually. Although genomic selection offers great potential in low-to middle-income countries because detailed pedigrees are not required to estimate breeding values with useful accuracy, the difficulty of effective phenotype recording, complex funding arrangements for a limited number of essential reference populations in only a handful of countries, questions around the sustainability of those livestock-resource populations, lack of on-farm, laboratory and computing infrastructure and lack of human capacity remain barriers to implementation. This paper examines those challenges and explores opportunities to mitigate or reduce the problems, with the aim of enabling smallholder livestock-keepers and their associated value chains in low-to middle-income countries to also benefit directly from genomic selection. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Small-scale farming production systems are integral drivers of global sustainability challenges and the climate crisis as well as a solution space for the transition to climate compatible development. However, mainstreaming agricultural emissions into a climate action agenda through integrative approaches, such as Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA), largely reinforces adaptation– mitigation dualism and pays inadequate attention to institutions’ linkage on the generation of externalities, such as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. This may undermine the effectiveness of local–global climate risk management initiatives. Literature data and a survey of small-scale farmers’ dairy feeding strategies were used in the simulation of GHG emissions. The effect of price risks on ecoefficiencies or the amount of GHG emissions per unit of produced milk is framed as a proxy for institutional feedbacks on GHG emissions and effect at scale. This case study on small-scale dairy farmers in western Kenya illustrates the effect of local-level and sectoral-level institutional constraints, such as market risks on decision making, on GHG emissions and the effectiveness of climate action. The findings suggest that price risks are significant in incentivising the adoption of CSA technologies. Since institutional interactions influence the choice of individual farmer management actions in adaptation planning, they significantly contribute to GHG spillover at scale. This can be visualised in terms of the nexus between low or non-existent dairy feeding strategies, low herd productivity, and net higher methane emissions per unit of produced milk in a dairy value chain. The use of the Sustainable Food Value Chain (SFVC) analytical lens could mediate the identification of binding constraints, foster organisational and policy coherence, as well as broker the effective mainstreaming of agricultural emissions into local–global climate change risk management initiatives. Market risks thus provide a systematic and holistic lens for assessing alternative carbon transitions, climate financing, adaptation–mitigation dualism, and the related risk of maladaptation, all of which are integral in the planning and implementation of effective climate action initiatives. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Agricultural cooperatives are producer-owned and controlled organizations to improve farmers’ livelihoods by correcting market failure. They support collective activities where individual incentives are insufficient to produce public goods. The government of Nepal has been investing economic resources in this sector, prioritizing cooperatives as part of a strategy for poverty reduction. This study examines poor farmers’ access to agricultural cooperatives and the impact of membership on farm and total household income, based on a household survey of 573 households and key informant interviews of 37 cooperative managers. The ethnicity of the family and the neighborhood, smallholder land size, distance to an agricultural cooperative, distance to the nearest local market, and distance to a motorable road are key determinants that influence cooperative membership. The analysis of the effects of cooperative membership is based on propensity score matching, controlling for a large array of household and community characteristics. The estimates imply that cooperative membership may significantly affect family net crop income, but the overall effects on total family income are modest. Agricultural cooperatives appear to be focused on financial services such as savings and credit activities but are less concerned with agricultural production, and cooperatives engage in almost no marketing activities. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction Zimbabwe is the largest producer of tobacco leaf in Africa and the sixth largest globally. Tobacco leaf is a mainstay of the economy, accounting for about 10% of the country's GDP in 2018. Methods We use descriptive and regression analyses from a face-to-face survey of 381 smallholder farmers in three major tobacco-farming areas in Manicaland province to determine the prevalence of tobacco-related debt and some of its covariates. The survey was conducted in June and July 2019. Results 74% of respondents are contract farmers and 26% are independent farmers. 57% of respondents indicated that they were in tobacco-related debt. The likelihood of being in tobacco-related debt is significantly more than average for farmers with the following characteristics (holding other characteristics constant): being a contract farmer, having a larger farm, employing only family labour and not recording expenses (as a proxy for financial sophistication). 91% of contract farmers would prefer to be independent farmers, while 63% of independent farmers would prefer to be contract farmers. Conclusion There is no evidence to suggest that tobacco growing, in its current state, has benefited the tobacco farmers in Manicaland province. Tobacco farmers are largely victims, rather than beneficiaries, of the sector. There is a strong case for government intervention to improve the conditions of tobacco farmers, either through direct intervention in the tobacco-growing sector, or by encouraging and promoting crop substitution. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

AB  - The future and benefits of mosaic landscapes have been a source of scientific and societal concern due to increasing population growth, climate change, urbanization, and expanding agricultural commodities. There is a growing call for integrated landscape approaches in which landscape actors discuss trade-offs between different land uses with a view to reaching a negotiated decision on the allocation of land uses. Yet, the operationalization of such approaches is still in its infancy, and integrated methodologies to visualize actors’ landscape visions are still scarce. This study therefore presents a participatory spatial scenario-building methodology that uncovers local perceptions of landscape dynamics and needed actions in a mixed cocoa-oil-palm landscape in Ghana’s Eastern Region. The methodology visualizes landscape actors’ perceived plausible changes and desired future landscapes, and is designed to trigger discussions on actions needed to achieve these desired futures. Findings show that farmers and institutional actors are aware of their landscapes with future preferences coming close to actual landscape composition and spatial configuration, and that—contrary to common assumptions—only those in the oil-palm-dominated landscape who already experienced the drawbacks of increasing landscape homogenization desire a mosaic landscape. The paper concludes that the collective mapping process makes actors aware of challenges at landscape level and increases farmers’ negotiation power through active engagement in the process and visualization of their knowledge and visions. Application of the methodology requires dedicated funding, political will, and capacity to apply it as an ongoing process, as well as monitoring feedback loops. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The revitalization of farmer organizations has become the central paradigm in agricultural development. In Indonesia, increasing farmer participation in farmer groups, associations and cooperatives is the strategy to revitalize farmer organizations. This study aimed to determine the factors influencing farmers' participation in farmer groups, associations and cooperatives. This study employed data from the Sugarcane and Tobacco Plantation Farm Household Survey in 2014, consisting of 8,831 (70.73%) sugarcane farmers and 3,645 (29.27%) tobacco farmers. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors contributing to farmers' participation in each organization. The results showed that harvest area, access to extension and contract farming positively affect farmers’ participation in organizations. Farmers' age and education positively affect their participation in associations and cooperatives but do not significantly affect their group participation. Land tenure has an ununiform effect on farmer participation in each organization. Tenant farmers are less likely to participate in farmer groups and cooperatives, but they tend to participate in associations. Meanwhile, the owner farmers are less likely to join cooperatives. Government support positively influences farmer group participation, shows a negative effect on participation in associations and has a non-significant effect on participation in cooperatives. Finally, farmers' wealth gives a positive effect on their participation in cooperatives, a negative effect on their participation in associations and a non-significant effect on farmer groups. These results depict that farmer groups are more inclusive than cooperatives and associations. © 2021 Universitas Sebelas Maret.

AB  - Globally, cocoa is famous for the production of chocolates and beverages. However, it also serves as a source of raw material for the manufacturing of high-quality cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Due to its high demand, cocoa is regarded as a major commodity for poverty alleviation in deprived cocoa farming communities. Government has therefore instigated relevant measures to address issues facing the sector by investing in extension programs. These programs act as information dissemination tools for teaching modern farming technologies and enhancing learning among farmers. This study highlighted the effects of the Cocoa Life Project (CLP) by Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE) International on farm productivity and income of 200 cocoa farmers in three districts of the Eastern Region, Ghana. Regression on covariates, Heckman's treatment effects model, and propensity scores were used to test the robustness of the estimates. A positive association between extension program participation, farm productivity, and household income was discovered. Specifically, after correcting for selection bias, the estimated results of the Heckman's model showed that the extension program significantly increased participating farmers’ cocoa yield by 14.3%. The effects on total farm income showed a significant increase of 25.1 and 42.9%, respectively from regression on propensity scores and the Heckman's model. Across all three models, program participation led to an increase in total household income by 46.1, 31.7, and 69.3%, respectively. Other variables such as farming characteristics, institutional and demographic factors affected farmers’ income, depending on the estimation method used. This study reiterated the supporting role played by extension programs in enhancing cocoa production and increasing household income in Ghana. Conclusively, government and development partners should invest in extension programs by providing enough logistics, training qualified agents, and creating a conducive atmosphere to support learning and technology adoption. © 2021 CAAS.

AB  - The “One Must Do, Five Reductions” (1M5R) program was certified in 2013, by Vietnam Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, as a national approach to promoting the best management practices in lowland rice cultivation. The main idea behind 1M5R is the use of good-quality/certified seeds (the One Must Do) as well as the reduction of seed rates, pesticide use, fertilizer inputs, water use, and postharvest losses (Five Reductions). However, the impact of these farming practices is not well understood. This study employs the propensity score matching (PSM) approach to investigate the factors that affect the adoption of the 1M5R practice and to estimate this technique's impact on the economic performance of rice cultivation. Primary data were collected through a household survey of 380 rice farms in four provinces in the Mekong Delta (MKD), Vietnam. The results indicate that adopting the 1M5R technique is significantly correlated with the educational level of household heads, their memberships in paddy cooperatives, and their attendance to previous training classes. Additionally, the 1M5R technical package helps farmers to reduce their production cost by 10%, increase a paddy's selling price by 4.5% per kg, and obtain 10% more profit, compared to traditional farming households. The return on investment for adopters increased by 22%. While the findings show that a sustainable farming technique is advantageous to local farmers, they fail to present any paddy yield increase in treatment fields. To scale up this program to other areas in the MKD, well-educated farmers who are still traditional producers/non-adopters should be positively invited for training classes of the program. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Poverty eradication is the primary goal of equitable and sustainable development and has received extensive attention from the international academic community. Rural land consolidation (RLC) is designed to achieve sustainable land use by combining land system reform and policy innovation; this has become an important means to promote China's poverty alleviation. From the perspective of micro-farmers, this paper takes the Sustainable Livelihood Approach (SLA) to reveal the influence of livelihood capital endowment on households’ income growth and poverty alleviation under different modes of RLC. According to the survey data of registered poor households in four counties (cities) of Hubei Province and Guizhou Province, this paper uses fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to empirically study several combinations of initial livelihood capital endowment after the implementation of different modes of RLC. The results show that RLC improves households’ initial livelihood capital endowment, reduces the vulnerability of the livelihood, thus promoting the accumulation of households' livelihood capital and the optimization of livelihood strategies and urging households to obtain a sustainable livelihood, so as to contribute to poverty alleviation. Whether in the government-dominated mode area or Public-Private Partnership（PPP）mode area, the five types of livelihood capital endowments of households are interdependent and collectively affect income growth and poverty alleviation. However, the requirements for households’ initial livelihood capital endowments are far lower after the implementation of PPP mode RLC than those after the implementation of government-dominated RLC. Based on these findings, this paper presents corresponding policy recommendations to improve the effectiveness of RLC poverty alleviation policy, and also provides China's experience and reference for other developing countries to formulate targeted antipoverty policies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Micronutrient deficiency is a pertinent global challenge that affects billions of people and has deleterious health effects. Large-scale food fortification (LSFF) is a cost- effective way to tackle micronutrient deficiency and improve health outcomes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the success of LSFF in LMICs is often hampered by limited compliance with fortification mandates by the private sector, who supply fortified foods. In this paper, we use a case study of the edible oil produced in Bangladesh to analyze the factors facilitating and impeding this compliance by for-profit actors. We identified four bottlenecks that disincentivize private sector actors’ decision to comply. First, fortified and non-fortified products co-exist in the market, disincentivizing producers to invest in fortification. Second, the lack of traceability reduces the risk for large-scale producers’ non-compliance with the regulation. Third, small-scale producers face economic pressures that prevent them from adequately fortifying oil products. Lastly, law enforcement is currently inconsistent, allowing the supply of under-fortified oil in the market. Given the evidence, we recommend to strengthen the control of bulk item fortification through more frequent and rigorous surveillance at the production level. This will ensure that resource constrained consumers who also have the greatest potential to benefit from added nutrients, remain able to access affordable and nutrient-enriched food. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The Collective Forest Tenure Reform, as a devolved forest tenure reform, was first launched in Fujian, China, in 2003, issuing forestland-use certificates to and increasing forestland access for rural households, allowing households to collateralize forestland for formal credit. This study aims to identify the impact of forestland-use certificates and household forestland and further explain their channels of impact on formal credit access. The conceptual framework in the literature includes two potential channels of impact: household's willingness to formal credit access and the institutional constraint in formal credit access. An econometric analysis was conducted using panel data of household level in Fujian province from 2012 to 2016. The econometric results demonstrated that: (1) forestland-use certificates had a significantly positive impact on the households’ formal credit access when it is measured only as formal credit by collateralizing forestland; (2) household forestland had significantly positive impact on households’ formal credit access when it is measured as total formal credit and formal credit by collateralizing forestland; (3) households’ willingness to access credit was significantly and positively affected by forestland-use certificates and household forestland, although the impact of household forestland is more certain and (4) institutional constraint in formal credit access was significantly and positively impacted by forestland use certificates but not by household forestland. Our study contains implications on the appropriate use of formal credit as a financial instrument in devolved forest tenure reform. © 2021 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland

AB  - Collective action and capacity building locally are key elements in overcoming poverty through agroforestry and community silviculture. Starting from extreme poverty, degraded soils and a reluctance to plant trees, the communities of Zambrana Abajo in the Dominican Republic were able to confront and change repressive forestry policies, obtaining the first legal right amongst smallholders to harvest timber and establish new livelihoods related to forestry and agroforestry. This study was carried out in order to identify the success factors and the lessons learned in this process. Qualitative research methods were used, including participant observation, review of literature, in-depth interviews with key informants, and semi-structured interviews guided by the Community Capitals Framework. It was found that community participation, local knowledge and the authorities’ recognition of it had an impact on forestry policy and overcoming poverty through livelihood diversification thanks to harvesting the species Acacia mangium Willd. The level of understanding about the benefits of trees influenced farmers' decisions to participate in agroforestry and community silviculture projects. The possibility of harvesting timber also influenced farmers' decision to participate and in the diffusion of this initiative to other parts of the country. These findings demonstrate that human capital and its recognition are relevant in improving quality of life for families and improving the natural environment. © 2021, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.

AB  - What role does traditional ecological knowledge play in the lives of smallholder farmers in post-conflict communities as they cope with the destructive impacts of war? In many cases, military weapons, such as unexploded bombs, are left behind in the surrounding landscape, forcing farmers to adapt their livelihood practices to the increased risk of death and injury. We analyze trends in the local production of knowledge in Ratanak Kiri province, Cambodia, an area heavily bombarded by the US Air Force during the Vietnam War. We argue that the system of traditional ecological knowledge has adapted to include basic information on bomb identification, location, and management strategies. This factual approach gives individuals the flexibility to generate their own views on whether they perceive unexploded ordnance as a violent hazard and/or an economic commodity. In a relatively short 50-year time period, the body of knowledge has been quickly accumulated and culturally transmitted to family and neighbors. Our findings suggest that traditional ecological knowledge should not be reduced to a static and ancient form of collective memory. We call for the expansion of the concept of traditional ecological knowledge to include short-term and dynamic processes of knowledge generation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Climate change such as extreme weather, unexpected temperature and rainfall fluctuations cause several significant risks to the agro-economy. This study, therefore, assessed the determinants of climate change perception (CCP), the level of perception and its impact on net farm income of rice farmers. This is imperative as the actual CC communication and policy, therefore, require a good understanding of smallholders' views and acknowledgment of individual's perception about CC. Employing cross-sectional data from 360 rice farmers selected from three States in South-West, Nigeria, a Ricardian model was used to analyse climate change impact on rice production. While accounting for selection bias, the study employed a double-hurdle (DH) model to estimate the determinants of farmers' perception of climate change. The results of DH estimation model show that location, access to credit, educational level and household size of the farmers are statistically significant factors influencing climate change perception (CCP). The result from the second hurdle shows that the perceived intensity of climate change was influenced by farm size, farming experience, marital status and educational level of smallholder rice farmers. The Ricardian model's result shows that farmers' income is influenced by CCP and their socio-economic characteristics. The results further indicate that smallholder rice farmers' net farm income is sensitive to marginal changes in both temperature and precipitation. Thus, this study recommends that government policies and investment strategies should be geared towards the support of education and the improvement of farmers' cooperatives, credit facilities and information about climate change, particularly in respect of smallholder rice farmers in Nigeria. The recommended improvements are imperative for food security. Investment in farmer training programmes is essential for development and may also be a panacea for improving the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies with the overall goal of increasing productivity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agricultural product certifications have proliferated due to the growing concerns in many countries over food safety and environmental sustainability. Encouraging farmers to self-organize was regarded as a useful tool to enhance the adoption of agricultural product certifications in Taiwan. However, previous studies solely focused on the association between membership in a production organization and single food certifications. Moreover, little is known of how different types of organizational participation could improve the adoption of agricultural product certifications. This study seeks to fill this knowledge gap by employing multinomial logistic regression model (MNL) to investigate factors affecting farmers’ decisions to participate in agricultural product certification. Special attention is paid to the role of different types of organizational participation in farmers’ choices for agricultural product certification. The study used a nationally representative sample of core farmers in Taiwan, and its results revealed evident differences in farmers’ organization types. For example, the farm operators who participate in agricultural cooperatives (co-ops) tend to use organic labels. In contrast, farm operators who participate in agricultural production and marketing groups (APMGs) tend to adopt the Traceable Agricultural Products (TAP) label. Moreover, age, education level, farming experience, farm labor, farm type, agricultural facilities, and regional location have a significant effect on farmers’ choices for participating in agricultural product certification across different models. The findings suggest that policymakers should consider these differences in the organizational operation of APMGs and co-ops and provide customized measures by promoting different types of agricultural product certifications. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - CONTEXT: High price volatility in agricultural commodities can be a major issue for value chain actors exposed to its adverse economic impacts. Price volatility results from the interaction of multiple factors linked within dynamic and complex agricultural systems. Therefore, to address price volatility, the approach needs to be capable of analysing feedback that occurs in such complex systems. OBJECTIVE: We integrate a systems thinking approach and value chain analysis to overcome the constraint of other methods to explicitly describe and understand how system structure influences system behaviour observed in price volatility and the assessment of the consequences of ex-ante and ex-post policy interventions based on this understanding. METHODS: The proposed integrated approach involves the active participation of value chain actors and stakeholders to improve their understanding of the complex systems they operate within including the policy environment. The approach takes the Indonesian chilli value chain as a case study. We implemented the first two steps of systems thinking (i.e., articulating problems and formulating dynamic hypotheses). In the group model building processes, we developed causal loop diagrams to represent a dynamic hypothesis that explains the feedback loops that cause price oscillation behaviour and systems archetypes that identify potential intervention points. RESULTS and CONCLUSIONS: The integrated approach was able to link the Indonesian chilli value chain's system structure and the system behaviour observed in price volatility. The causal loop diagram clearly displays the feedback between production, market governance, consumption, and price. The diagram also portrays how these factors impact value chain actors' performance and the influence of time delays and random shocks on the entire value chain system. Limits to growth and shifting the burden archetypes were identified as critical leverage points in formulating fundamental policy interventions to address price volatility. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates the strengths of the proposed approach in developing a comprehensive dynamic qualitative model of a whole value chain system that influences the system behaviour, such as oscillation, which other modelling studies do not consider. The use of system archetypes to identify intervention points is another research contribution in that it improves value chain analysis. The results also highlight the benefits of participatory system dynamics modelling in enhancing the learning of value chain actors in anticipating the consequences of any actions or random shocks on the entire systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is a viral disease of suids that frequently leads to death. There are neither licensed vaccines nor treatments available, and even though humans are not susceptible to the disease, the serious socio-economic consequences associated with ASF have made it one of the most serious animal diseases of the last century. In this context, prevention and early detection play a key role in controlling the disease and avoiding losses in the pig value chain. Target biosecurity measures are a strong strategy against ASF virus (ASFV) incursions in farms nowadays, but to be efficient, these measures must be well-defined and easy to implement, both in commercial holdings and in the backyard sector. Furthermore, the backyard sector is of great importance in low-income settings, mainly for social and cultural practices that are highly specific to certain areas and communities. These contexts need to be addressed when authorities decide upon the provisions that should be applied in the case of infection or decide to combine them with strict preventive measures to mitigate the risk of virus spread. The need for a deeper understanding of the smallholder context is essential to prevent ASFV incursion and spread. Precise indications for pig breeding and risk estimation for ASFV introduction, spread and maintenance, taking into account the fact that these recommendations would be inapplicable in some contexts, are the keys for efficient target control measures. The aim of this work is to describe the 305 outbreaks that occurred in domestic pigs in Sardinia during the last epidemic season (2010–2018) in depth, providing essential features associated with intensive and backyard farms where the outbreaks occurred. In addition, the study estimates the average of secondary cases by kernel transmission network. Considering the current absence of ASF outbreaks in domestic pig farms in Sardinia since 2018, this work is a valid tool to specifically estimate the risk associated with different farm types and update our knowledge in this area. © Copyright © 2021 Rolesu, Mandas, Loi, Oggiano, Dei Giudici, Franzoni, Guberti and Cappai.

AB  - On-farm timber production is an important subsistence and economic activity of smallholder farmers around the world. Farmer investment in wood production and the degree of formality in the sector depends on access to and conditions of the market, the nature of the regulatory frameworks that govern rights to and movement of timber, and access to financing. We evaluate the process of formalization of a thriving and adaptive existing supply chain for small-dimension lumber originating in the fallows of smallholder farmers in the Peruvian Amazon. Through field research over three years based in semi-structured interviews with diverse actors in the Amazon, we found that the supply chain for fallow timber is driven entirely by informal and some illegal transactions. A key reason for this is the lack of an appropriate regulatory mechanism by which producers can gain authorization to harvest and sell this timber. We identify conditions necessary to formalize this sector, and evaluate the degree to which these are met under several scenarios. We recommend that the state develop mechanisms that recognize property rights of long-term residents and establish a simple fallow forestry registration mechanism; and that local governments or non-governmental organizations adopt adaptive and collaborative approaches to support farmers and provide training, information and networking among actors. State recognition of and support for fallow forestry, coupled with producers organizing for collective action on processing and marketing their timber, could result in the formalization of a significant volume of timber, improvements in income security for rural people, and the development of local entrepreneurial activities. © Copyright © 2021 Sears, Cronkleton, Miranda Ruiz and Pérez-Ojeda del Arco.

AB  - Promotion of improved crop varieties is an effective means of increasing farm productivity and alleviating poverty in rural areas. A successful dissemination of such varieties requires a deep understanding of target farmers’ attitudes, preferences and socio-economic status. This study aimed at assessing factors linked to smallholder farmers’ adoption decision for improved sweet potato varieties (ISPVs) in South-Kivu. A household survey was conducted on 360 smallholder farmers from four South-Kivu territories, in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), including Idjwi, Kabare, Kalehe and Walungu, and data were analyzed using a logit regression model. The adoption decision was negatively affected by farmers’ age and the field-to-house distance. In contrast, the ISPVs adoption was favored by farmers’ education level, reduced farm size, off-farm incomes, high monthly income and use of hired farm labor. Besides, farmers’ cooperative membership, access to credit and planting materials, and contacts with extension services were instrumental in adopting improved sweet potato varieties in South-Kivu. This study highlighted the need to strengthen extension services, seed delivery systems, and amending the credit systems for increased impact on improved varieties adoption among South-Kivu sweet potato farmers. © 2021

AB  - In developing countries, producer organizations (POs) are important for achieving women empowerment mainly through promoting women's access to the organization's resources and services. However, by improving access to markets and technologies, household membership in POs often results in commercialization of smallholder farming, leading to women disempowerment as men take over control of the farm. We use data from dairy smallholders in Kenya to explore the impact of membership in bargaining and processing POs on women empowerment. Applying the Women Empowerment Livestock Index, we capture six domains of empowerment: production; nutrition; resources; income; opportunities; and workload. We find that when a household joins any PO, regardless of whether the man or the woman in the household is the registered member, women achieve a higher control over production decisions, buying and selling of land and cows, use of loans and receiving dairy income. Distinguishing by gender of membership, there is stronger women empowerment when the woman in the household is a member. We also find that woman membership in bargaining POs results in greater empowerment, in terms of ownership of cows, than woman membership in processing POs. The paper suggests that women empowerment is affected by the functional characteristics of POs. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The concept of sustainable livelihood garnered a prominent status in humanitarian and international development organizations that aim to calculate and build a livelihood for agroforestry farmers. However, it is difficult to measure and analyze as well as visualize the data of livelihood improvement from agroforestry (AF). This paper comparatively assessed 400 smallholder farmers’ livelihood through AF and conventional farming (CF) systems in the Northern Irrigated Plain of Pakistan. The findings showed that AF has a mixed impact on farmers’ livelihood capital, including human, physical, natural, financial and social capital. Specifically, AF significantly improved financial capital in terms of timber, non-timber and fuel wood income. Furthermore, the physical capital (buffalo plough, generators and sprinklers), natural capital (the extent of cultivated land and land ownership; the number of households (HHs) growing vegetables, fruit crops and medicinal crops) and social capital (the number of social groups that HHs involved and number of HHs sharing crop seeds) of AF farmer HHs were significantly improved compared to those of CF farmers. However, the results show that financial capital gain through crop income, HHs owning high-value vehicles (tractors) and farmers trust and collective activities were significantly higher in CF farmers than AF ones. Therefore, to enhance the contribution of AF to rural livelihood, advanced extension services and government involvement on research planning and implementing are needed. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The value chain comprises several factors and activities useful for strengthening production and distribution by connecting producers with suppliers, intermediaries, and marketplaces and collaboratively creating added value for products or goods. However, the values of agricultural products mostly depend on various factors and actors, which should be linked together for fostering added values. Thus, there may be strong ground for facilitating a smooth transition of the agricultural value chain (AVC) within the prospects of emerging countries. It could be a key means of promoting a profound connection between smallholder farmers and modern agriculture facilities. It could be especially crucial for the highly perishable and high-value product such as fruits. The main aims of the study are to evaluate the factors influencing smallholder apple farmers’ participation in the agricultural value chain and determine whether participation in AVC improves farmers’ production performance. The empirical setup of the study was chosen based on survey data of apple growers in Shandong, China. The propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) models were employed to craft the study’s outcomes. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) Fruit farmers’ gender, total household expenditure, housing value, planting scale, planting years, degree of specialization, days of family labour input, and total days of employment have significant effects on their participation in AVC activities. (2) Fruit farmers’ usage of improved fertilizers and organization participation supports a higher yield and net income per acre. (3) Participating in two kinds of AVC can significantly improve the yield per acre and net income per acre compared with only using one type of AVC (improved fertilizer). Policy makers should improve the existing policy by eliminating institutional barriers and enhancing human factors for farmers to participate in high-value chain activities. Governments should extend technical support, and enhance training facilities, and comprehensively promote the AVC among smallholder farmers. Finally, farmers’ organizations (e.g., cooperatives and credit organizations) should come forward to help facilitate the effectiveness of AVC. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Smallholder commercialization is central to international development policy and prac-tice. As a result, several arrangements to foster market linkages are being implemented. Especially popular are farmers’ organizations, which are believed to be owned, controlled, and financed by smallholders. As such, their design is considered inclusive given every household in a community is theoretically allowed to become a member, and the governance and management structure encourage participatory decision-making. However, even in the context in which farmers’ organizations are actively promoted, a notable proportion of smallholders may not be able to engage in market-oriented production or may opt for the existing alternative marketing arrangements, as dictated by individual households’ socioeconomic characteristics. Focusing on the case of smallholder farming in Olenguruone, Nakuru county, Kenya, where a donor funded dairy farmers’ cooperative marketing arrangement is promoted alongside existing marketing opportunities, the present research investigated the factors that determine smallholders’ commercial farming orientation and marketing arrangements. It employed a case study approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative research methods for a more complete empirical inquiry. The findings demonstrate that irrespective of the external support provided through marketing opportunities such as farmer organizations, smallholders’ engagement in commercial farming and marketing is dictated by the socioeconomic attributes and market perceptions that are heterogeneous among households in a smallholder community. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The welfare of many poor and low-income rural households is vulnerable to earthquakes and secondary geological disasters. The academic literature, however, pays little attention to the livelihood pressure, adaptability, and livelihood strategies of these households. Based on the survey data of 327 rural households in the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquake-stricken areas in the Sichuan Province, the livelihood pressure, adaptability, and livelihood strategy characteristics of rural households were analyzed, and the disordered multi-classification logistic regression model was constructed to explore the correlation between the above-mentioned variables. The results show that: (1) Rural households face the greatest economic pressure and the least social pressure; rural households have the strongest adaptability in social capital and the lowest adaptability in financial capital. The proportion of rural households that chose the aid livelihood strategy was the highest, while the proportion of rural households that chose the adjustment livelihood strategy was the lowest. (2) Compared with the expanded livelihood strategy, (a) When the health pressure is higher, the rural households are more inclined to choose the expanded livelihood strategy, followed by the contractive livelihood strategy and, finally, the aid livelihood strategies; (b), the higher the physical capital, the more often the rural households tend to choose the expanded livelihood strategy compared to the adjustment livelihood strategy; (c), The higher the financial capital of farm households, the more they prefer contractive livelihood strategies compared to the expanded livelihood strategy and (d), compared with the aid livelihood strategy, rural households with greater economic pressure are more inclined to choose the expanded livelihood strategy.This study can provide a reference for the establishment of relevant policies related to the adaptation capacity of rural households in the earthquake hazard zone. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Recent studies have shed light on the emergence of Southern sustainability initiatives in commodity-based value chains. These initiatives position themselves as countering the exclusionary nature of many global multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs), as critically analysed by previous studies. However, a common theoretical perspective on the inclusiveness of MSIs is still lacking. By drawing on the theory of regimes of engagement, we develop a theoretical framework which helps understanding the overt and subtle practices of including or excluding different stakeholders in MSIs. We apply this framework to ‘Trustea’, an Indian MSI for sustainable tea production, to further investigate the ‘inclusiveness paradigm’ of Southern sustainability initiatives. Our findings highlight the complexity of stakeholder engagement across the different phases of Trustea’s development, from initiation and code development to formal launch and roll-out. We find that different types of engagement can exist in parallel. Justifiable engagement is expressed in the participating organisations’ reference to a shared common goal of Trustea, whereas familiar engagement is linked to the rootedness of the individuals involved in the Indian tea industry. Strategic engagement, in turn, comes to the fore through the strong emphasis on developing an Indian code for sustainable tea production and promoting adoption among tea growers. The importance of reaching this objective has led to the replication of exclusionary patterns also noted for global MSIs, as small-scale producers and other weak actors have been largely excluded from decision-making processes, despite informal efforts aimed at substitution of representation. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper we descriptively investigate the Covid-19 pandemic's early impact on the fruit and vegetable supply chain in Senegal, using trade statistics and survey data collected through online questionnaires and telephone interviews with smallholder farmers, agro-industrial companies, agricultural workers, traders, importers, and consumers. Our results point to major differences in how Covid-19 and containment measures disrupt supply chains between the modern export-oriented supply chain that is centered around a few large vertically integrated agro-industrial companies, and the more traditional domestic-oriented supply chain with a large number of smallholder farmers and informal traders—with the former being more resilient to the Covid-19 shock. We show that both the modern and the traditional supply chain innovate to cope with the Covid-19 containment measures. While our study is subject to some limitations, our findings bring nuance in the debate on the resilience of the food system to the pandemic, and have important policy and research implications toward international trade, social safety measures, and food and nutrition security. © 2021 International Association of Agricultural Economists

AB  - Despite the widespread belief that marketing cooperatives’ benefits may extend beyond participating farmers, little is known about the cooperative's effect on nonparticipating farmers. This paper exploits exogenous variation in language spoken at home in Thailand to obtain instrumental variable estimates of the spillover effect of marketing cooperatives. We hypothesize that farmers who sell rice to private intermediaries in the area where there is direct competition between marketing cooperatives and private intermediaries (treated areas) are likely to receive a higher price than those who sell rice in other areas. Using household-level data of rice farmers in Thailand in the marketing year 2018/19, we find strong evidence that farmers in treated areas receive 10.9% higher prices from private intermediaries than those in comparison areas. Our results provide crucial implications for food policy debates regarding the role of marketing cooperatives in agri-food value chains. In particular, evaluating the inclusiveness of marketing cooperatives toward poor farmers should not be limited to sampling and analyzing its members only. Failure to consider the spillover effect could lead to substantial underestimation of the impact of marketing cooperatives on societal welfare. © 2021 The Author(s)

From micro data collected by a survey of poor, rural households living in the mountainous region of Central Vietnam, a structural equation model (SEM) incorporating the six factors of household head characteristics, household characteristics, reputation statuses of households, forest characteristics, willingness to participate in NTFP value chains, and financial effects of NTFP value chains was established. An empirical study of the effects of farmers' behaviors on NTFP financial value chains was also conducted. The results showed that household head characteristics, household characteristics, reputation statuses of households, and forest characteristics were positively correlated with people's willingness to participate in NTFP value chains and increase the financial efficiency of the value chains. However, each factor has a different level of influence. Additional empirical factors affecting farmers' awareness of poverty reduction policies were investigated. It was found that the more farmers understand sustainable poverty reduction policies, the more willing they are to participate in the value chains. The willingness to participate in the value chains strongly affects the financial performances of the value chains. Farmers are expected to be willing to fulfill their obligations and their enthusiasm for participating in the value chains has increased the financial efficiency of the value chains. In the future, the government can cooperate with official financial institutions, policy finance institutions, and local rural intermediaries to increase public financial knowledge, poverty reduction policies and projects in poor areas, and the participation of poor farmers, as well as solve their credit problems. Meanwhile, in developing a financial model of new NTFP value chains, more attention should be paid to the needs of farmers and this model should be built with the aim of the sustainable development of NTFP value chains. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The current agricultural system in China highly depends on chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Consequently, agricultural production activities cause various environmental issues. Carrying out safe production provides vital support for sustainable development of agriculture, which may improve this situation. The past decades have witnessed the fast development of rural cooperatives organization in China. Given the fact that rural cooperative organization plays a crucial role in agricultural production, however, there is little empirical evidence on the relationship between cooperative membership and safe production of smallholders in China. This study aims to investigate whether the participation in farmer cooperatives contributes to safe production in agriculture in China. Using survey data covering 623 rice-producing farm households in Sichuan province in China, this study employs the endogenous switching regression model to examine the effects of the participation in farmer cooperatives on safe production in rice agriculture. The results show that cooperative membership has significantly positive effects on safe production in rice agriculture. In particular, the average treatment effects demonstrate that without the participation in cooperatives, the members’ adoption of the green control techniques would reduce by 74.491%, the application of artificial weeding would reduce by 38.768%, and organic fertilizer input would reduce by 23.448%. Furthermore, the marginal treatment effect is employed to evaluate the heterogeneous effects of the participation in farmer cooperatives on safe production in rice agriculture. Heterogeneous effect analyses suggest that farmers who are more likely to participate in farmer cooperatives are easier to adopt green control technology, while farmers who are less likely to participate in farmer cooperatives are easier to adopt artificial weeding and increase organic fertilizer input. To improve safe production in rice agriculture, the Chinese government is expected to encourage rice farmers to participate in rural cooperative organizations, and to stimulate rice farmers to take collective action to address environment issues arising from agricultural production. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Ending poverty is a top priority of the international development agenda, and governments worldwide have attached great importance to poverty alleviation measures. However, poverty reduction policies have mostly focused on men, which has widened the gap in productivity and income between men and women and increased gender inequality. This paper aims to determine the impacts of a multi-component program on women's empowerment and poverty reduction, and explore the role empowered women play in poverty reduction. The dataset used in this study was collected in nine poor counties of Ulanqab City in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China at the end of 2014, yielding a sample of 900 households. Recall questions were used to reconstruct the baseline data and build a panel dataset. Smaller groups of rural households were further identified to better target the women in the beneficiary group. To control the selection bias, propensity score matching, inverse probability weighting, and the difference-in-differences matching method were used to analyze the effect of the program and undertake robust checks. The results show that the program has positive effects on women's empowerment and poverty reduction simultaneously. Empowering women also has positive effects on poverty reduction, and the women who were the beneficiaries have contributed to increasing the incomes and living standards of households. Training, microfinance, and associations are common means or strategies to empower women to address poverty. This paper provides new empirical evidence that women can benefit from a gender-focus program through portfolio intervention such as training, cooperatives, and credit. Empowered women further improve the livelihoods of poor households and help lift them out of poverty. The results suggest that researchers and policymakers need to pay more attention to poverty issues from the perspective of gender. © 2021 CAAS. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V

AB  - This study investigates the impact of the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) on rural households to escape poverty. We employ the instrumental variable method, the IVProbit model, to analyze the national data from the rural-resident field survey by the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) in 2016. Based on the large-scale data, we found that, first, the hospitalization of family members is the key factor in increasing the risk of the family falling into poverty. The NRCMS has significantly reduced the likely risk of falling into poverty. Second, the impact of the NRCMS on poverty alleviation varies among groups with different levels of income. There is no impact on the upper-middle and high-income groups; in contrast, the NRCMS has substantially improved the capacity of low-income rural families to prevent poverty due to illness, especially for the lower-middle-income group. Third, there exist significant regional differences in the impact of NRCMS on the health poverty alleviation of rural households in China. The NRCMS has successfully reduced the risk of rural households in the western region falling into poverty, simultaneously, no significant impact on those in the eastern and central regions. In order to diminish and eliminate poverty eventually and boost rural residents’ capacity for income acquisition, we propose the following: raise the actual compensation ratio of the NRCMS, control the rising expense of NRCMS by promoting the payment method reform, construct the comprehensive healthcare system in the western region, strengthen the medical security for the poor in remote area, and enhance the living environment for rural residents. © 2021 CAAS.

AB  - The debate on smallholder commodification trajectories tends to be polarised between mainstream approaches that advocate tighter integration of smallholders into global value chains, and alternative approaches that favour localised markets on the grounds that these provide greater autonomy over production and marketing, and allow a greater share of value to be realised for producers and the wider community. This debate obscures the interrelations and possible synergies between them; a critique taken up in this paper. Using a case study on agricultural diversification in the former homeland of Venda, South Africa, we explore the usefulness of the nested markets concept to make sense of smallholders' patterning of markets by combining tree crops for export with seasonal vegetables for local markets. Exploring the drivers of diversification, we show how farmers’ patterning of markets depends on their profiles and corresponding trajectory of accumulation. Local markets are articulated systems that function as hybrid spaces of interaction that enable farmers without any alternative off-farm income to gain and sustain access to global commodity markets. This challenges the framing of nested markets as an act of resistance as well as the dichotomy between local versus global markets as mutually exclusive. Instead, we argue that these markets can be interconnected and mutually supportive and are opportunistically used as such by petty commodity producers to sustain their export-oriented production system. If these relations are better understood, they stand to enable agrarian policy, which currently favours high-value tree crops, to be more inclusive of young and less well-resourced farmers. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Implementing another round of massive collective forest tenure reform in China since in 2008 has not materialized the government's expectation on small-scale timber forestry–improved management practices and resource quality. One underlying cause to this outcome is farmer's risk-averse attitude, which has thus far garnered little research attention. In this study, we combine the prospect theory and a lottery experiment to measure individual risk preferences on timber forestry investment. Based on a sample of 303 households conducted in 2018 in Fujian, China, we find that the ‘household risk preference’ parameter has a significant negative impact on both the decision to invest in timber forestry and the intensity of investment. Further, the ‘loss aversion’ and ‘probability weighting’ parameters affect household investment intensity negatively. These results indicate that the more risk averse rural households are, the less willing they are to invest in timber forestry, and the lower their investment intensities are. Also, the effect of the risk preferences on cash outlay is larger than on labor cost. These insights have direct implications for better designing tenure reform and other policies to promote smallholder forestry in China and beyond. © 2021

AB  - The shock of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disrupted food systems worldwide. Such disruption, affecting multiple systems interfaces in smallholder agriculture, is unprecedented and needs to be understood from multi-stakeholder perspectives. The multiple loops of causality in the pathways of impact renders the system outcomes unpredictable. Understanding the nature of such unpredictable pathways is critical to identify present and future systems intervention strategies. Our study aims to explore the multiple pathways of present and future impact created by the pandemic and “Amphan” cyclonic storm on smallholder agricultural systems. Also, we anticipate the behaviour of the systems elements under different realistic scenarios of intervention. We explored the severity and multi-faceted impacts of the pandemic on vulnerable smallholder agricultural production systems through in-depth interactions with key players at the micro-level. It provided contextual information, and revealed critical insights to understand the cascading effect of the pandemic and the cyclone on farm households. We employed thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with multiple stakeholders in Sundarbans areas in eastern India, to identify the present and future systems outcomes caused by the pandemic, and later compounded by “Amphan”. The immediate adaptation strategies of the farmers were engaging family labors, exchanging labors with neighbouring farmers, borrowing money from relatives, accessing free food rations, replacing dead livestock, early harvesting, and reclamation of waterbodies. The thematic analysis identified several systems elements, such as harvesting, marketing, labor accessibility, among others, through which the impacts of the pandemic were expressed. Drawing on these outputs, we employed Mental Modeler, a Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Mapping tool, to develop multi-stakeholder mental models for the smallholder agricultural systems of the region. Analysis of the mental models indicated the centrality of “Kharif” (monsoon) rice production, current farm income, and investment for the next crop cycle to determine the pathways and degree of the dual impact on farm households. Current household expenditure, livestock, and soil fertility were other central elements in the shared mental model. Scenario analysis with multiple stakeholders suggested enhanced market access and current household income, sustained investment in farming, rapid improvement in affected soil, irrigation water and livestock as the most effective strategies to enhance the resilience of farm families during and after the pandemic. This study may help in formulating short and long-term intervention strategies in the post-pandemic communities, and the methodological approach can be used elsewhere to understand perturbed socioecological systems to formulate anticipatory intervention strategies based on collective wisdom of stakeholders. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper explores the different pathways of technology diffusion and the resulting impacts on technology adoption that can emerge following a strategy to incorporate vulnerable communities of small-scale producers into traditionally top-down governance agribusiness systems. Building on the Contract Farming Arrangements (CFA) literature, we suggest that despite high levels of top-down control and the mono systems of diffusion that these practices imply, diffusion forms can vary considerably according to the motivations that drive different types of producers and the variances in local governance. We summarise these diffusion forms as a diffusion pathway of governance dictated by dominant change agent control and a diffusion pathway of governance dictated by change agent control and user participation. An important contribution of the paper is to highlight the critical role of formal rules in defining the types of governance for the creation of these different pathways. However, additional factors associated with the participation of smallholders such as attachment to land, engagement in collective action and long-term sustainability visions also introduce variations in these pathways and define the results of technology adoption. The study focuses on the Colombian oil palm sector; a key agribusiness sector targeted by policy makers with a strategy to integrate small-scale farmers into the agribusiness value chain as a means to relieve poverty and reduce levels of rural violence associated with conflicts over land and production of elicit crops. © 2020

AB  - Understanding the preferences of smallholder farmers for contracting can help in making contracts more sustainable. This paper presents the results of a choice experiment (CE) among smallholder farmers in Indonesia to assess their preferences for accepting contracts with modern retail. The CE was based on attributes of actual sales transactions in modern retail and traditional retail channels. A total of 301 vegetable smallholder farmers participated, consisting of 173 farmers participating in traditional markets and 128 in modern retail markets. A random parameter logit model estimates that, in general, smallholders do not prefer contracting with modern retail over spot market selling in traditional retail channels. Most contract attributes are perceived as negative by smallholders. A willingness-to-accept analysis shows that farmers are critical of most contract attributes, particularly those related to quality requirements. Producer organizations (POs) reduce transaction costs and increase smallholders' preference toward contracts. Contract designs that reduce transaction cost, mitigate risks for farmers, provide fair prices, and involve POs are more likely to attract smallholders to modern retail channels.

AB  - Food insecurity caused by climate change has become one of the main issues on the global agenda. Worldwide, the importance of digital tools as a means to enhance adaptive capacity and resilience of smallholder farmers (SHFs) in the face of climate variability has long been recognised. Technology-based systems in agriculture frequently neglect to consider the actual context of use and adoption by SHFs in rural and developing contexts. These conditions, as pointed out in the literature, range from high “illiteracy” rates to poor technology infrastructure to a requirement for smartphone-based technology of which very few SHFs in the developing world can take advantage. However, very little is known about the information and communication technology (ICT) literacy levels of SHFs in general in terms of supporting them in their farming decisions. This paper, therefore, explores the ICT literacy levels of Msinga SHFs in order to understand what could enhance their use and adoption of ICT for weather forecasting. Msinga is a hotspot for climate change. Consequently, the means of livelihood of the SHFs in this municipality have been negatively impacted. Volunteering sampling was used, in which 35 SHFs were purposively selected from a population of 100 SHFs who belong to the Asisukume Msinga Agricultural Cooperative (AMAC) – all irrigation farmers. A sequential transformative mixed method design, embedded in an Indigenous research framework, was employed. This paper reports on the quantitative aspects of the study which addressed the following two research questions: (i) What are Msinga SHFs ICT literacy capability levels? and (ii) What is the relationship between SHFs ICT levels and their demographic data w.r.t. their adoption of ICT tools in their agricultural practices? Data were collected using a demographic details questionnaire (examining age, marriage, educational level, and years of farming experience) and an assessment of ICT literacy (assessing 5 ICT literacy skills which included mobile phone symbol identification to advanced ICT literacy). Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics, specifically the use of Spearman rank-order correlation using IBM® Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS®), version 20. The results suggest that for the ICT literacy levels, SHFs were not able to display use of the various ICT related skills, with the exception of ICT levels 1 and 2 where satisfactory display of ICT literacy were displayed among most of the SHFs. When examining the associations between ICT literacy levels and the demographic variables, significant negative associations were found between the ICT literacy levels and age as well as years of experience, while significant positive associations were found between ICT literacy levels and educational level. The results, furthermore, suggest that marital status has no correlation with ICT literacy proficiency. The findings arising from this study highlight the “importance of context” in helping SHFs to mitigate the threats of climate change on food production, an issue that is completely ignored in curriculum policies and policies aimed at integrated national adaptation responses to climate change impact and vulnerability. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Substantial literature exists on household lifestyles and related energy use and emissions in the global north, but little is known for many countries the global south. We estimate household-level energy footprints for Zambia covering direct (traditional and modern energy carriers) and indirect energy use, and adopting energy extended multiregional input–output. We employ final energy consumption, as it is closer to energy services and thus the purpose of energy use than the total primary energy use. The inequality in energy footprints differs from the inequality in incomes: the poorest half of the households have similar energy footprints and only high-income urban households have significant indirect energy footprints, associated with spend on goods and services. We examine the association between energy footprints and basic well-being measured in terms of physical health, education, nutrition and access to clean water using logistic regression, for a sub-sample of households with children under the age of five. We find that access to provisioning systems is more important than income for need satisfaction. Rural households have limited access to modern energy and provisioning systems and as a result fewer of them attain desirable well-being outcomes. We conclude that access to collective provisioning systems such as education, electricity and indoor sanitation is more important for household need satisfaction than individual provisioning in the form of ownership of durables, or even income. Further research is needed to improve the understanding of the association between energy use and needs satisfaction as it is crucial for addressing decarbonisation and human development agendas. © 2021

AB  - Frankincense, gum arabic and myrrh are among the most valuable commercial non-timber forest products in the drylands of eastern Africa. This study examines the frankincense value chain and its contribution to the household economy in southern Ethiopia. The study applied a combination of sustainable livelihood and value chain framework to assess the values and the contribution of frankincense to household economies. Data were collected through a household survey, focus group discussions, key informant interviews and field observations. On average, the annual cash income generated from the harvest and sale of frankincense was estimated at 60 USD per adult equivalent unit (AEU) which was 35% of the total household annual cash income. Our analyses reveal that income from frankincense constitutes the second largest share of the total average household cash income after livestock, which accounted for 60%. The poorer households (44% of the sample) have a relatively higher reliance on frankincense income (49.8%), which is almost as much as the contribution from livestock and non-farm income combined (50.2%). Frankincense income functions as a supplementary source of income for the herders. The value chain analysis shows that the price increases from nearly 1 USD per kg at harvest sites to 5.5 USD per kg at the retail level. Nevertheless, despite the abundance of the resource and a growing domestic market demand, the marketed quantities are low, extraction practices are primitive and both local and national markets are poorly developed. Recommendations for researchers and development practitioners include improving harvesting and processing skills through training, introducing harvesting and post-harvest technologies, improving market access, providing credit services, and training to gatherers and local traders on value-adding activities and marketing skills. These measures could improve the economic returns from frankincense extraction and sale and contribute to increased incomes and more sustainable livelihoods. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Africa's agriculture and food systems were already grappling with challenges such as climate change and weather variability, pests and disease, and regional conflicts. With rising new cases of COVID 19 propelling various African governments to enforce strict restrictions of varying degrees to curb the spread. Thus, the pandemic posed unprecedented shocks on agriculture and food supply chains in Sub Saharan Africa. In this study, we use survey data collected from nine countries in Central, Eastern, and Southern, Africa to understand the immediate impact of COVID-19 on production, distribution, and consumption of common beans, and possible food security implications. Descriptive analysis of data collected from bean farmers, aggregators, processors, bean regional coordinators, and mechanization dealers reveal that COVID-19 and government restrictions had impacted the availability and cost of farm inputs and labour, distribution, and consumption of beans in Eastern and Southern Africa. The immediate impacts were dire in Southern Africa with Central Africa slightly impacted. The production and distribution challenges negatively impacted on frequency and patterns of food consumption in households in Africa. Thus, the pandemic poses a greater risk to food security and poverty in the region. Governments could play a significant role in supporting the needs of smallholder farmers, traders and other actors through provision of subsidized agricultural inputs. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Mobile phone applications (apps) designed to assist smallholder farmers improve decision-making have been revolutionizing the agriculture sector. These apps offer solutions to farmer information needs by providing weather information, crop market trends, pest and disease damage identification, and advice on pesticide and fertilizer use. They also facilitate interaction with fellow farmers, extension workers and other stakeholders in the value chain who are interested in information exchange. Much previous research has investigated the contribution of mobile apps to agricultural production. This study explored the agricultural mobile apps available in Myanmar, analyzed factors affecting their use and assessed the potential for farm-based decision support. Our findings indicate that when introducing mobile-based tools, focus should be given to younger, more educated farmers growing more specialized crops. The main constraints to adopt agricultural apps are lack of access to smartphone and/or internet (63%) and lack of digital knowledge (20%). However, smallholder farmers in Myanmar were optimistic and positive toward agricultural apps for effective utilization. We also found that majority of the surveyed farmers were familiar with information received through Facebook groups. Incorporating useful information and functions from an agricultural mobile app to a Facebook Page could have a more useful and sustainable impact. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Macadamia is an essential commodity crop in Malawi. The nuts are a lucrative commodity and are used for household consumption, income generation among farming families and as a foreign exchange earning crop at country-level. Macadamia production in Malawi has increased significantly in recent years. Malawi is the seventh top producer of macadamia nuts valued at £23.5 million, with a global market share of 3%. In 2018, the country was the fourth-largest exporter of macadamia nuts that were valued at £18.2 million. The majority (90%) of this crop was grown by large commercial estates with smallholder’s production only contributing about 10% of the total crop production. However, the smallholder sector is vital for the future growth of the macadamia sector in the country. Further, Malawian smallholders consider macadamia production as a lowinput crop with large returns per unit area (£10.7 kg-1 ha-1), and it thus a lucrative commodity with high potential for poverty reduction and wealth creation among these farming families. This paper, therefore, explores: (i) the historical and current trends in macadamia nut production in Malawi; (ii) analyses the country’s macadamia value chain focusing on smallholder farmer contributions; and (iii) discusses the constraints of smallholder macadamia production in Malawi for informed policymaking. We conclude that the synthesis of the Malawian macadamia sub-sector provides an understanding of the vital contributions of macadamia to Malawi’s economic growth and improvement of livelihoods. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - While the health impact of COVID‐19 in most African countries appears modest, the impact of social distancing measures, closing of markets and reduced mobility is felt across the board. Domestic, labor‐intensive and traditional food value chains and the smallholders they serve appear to be particularly affected. During a systemic shock where idiosyncratic risk coping strategies fail, collective or organizational resilience becomes of the essence to protect the livelihoods of smallholders. In this study, we have used pre‐ and during‐shock data on agricultural cooperatives from Southeast Africa to understand how resilient these smallholder‐owned organizations are. We find that many organizations could not countervail market‐disruptions and fell into a state of dormancy during the pandemic. One reason for this is that collective decision‐making was heavily affected by the banning of gatherings. Only a few organizations devised innovative solutions to maintain the market linkages of rural smallholders. The lack of resilience demonstrated by most cooperatives appears to be associated with organizational immaturity, large membership size, elite capture and limited business‐orientation, which underscore a general lack of managerial capital. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina, rural poverty is an unresolved issue, despite farming having been a poverty coping strategy for many rural dwellers, especially after the end of the Balkan war. Eradicating poverty is among the priorities of the national government that aims at EU candidacy and accession. Being the most dynamic among agricultural sectors, berry farming is a key agricultural activity at the national level and had been the subject of rural development interventions, including the establishment of agricultural cooperatives. This article provides evidence from the largest agricultural cooperative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to inform decision making and policy planning. The article aims at describing and analyzing the status and dynamics of poverty at the farm household level while highlighting their contributing factors, as well as at proposing possible development strategies based on the voice of local actors. Given the complexity and multifaceted features of the investigated issues, the methodological approach of this study relies on a mixed-methods research design, where the quantitative findings from the analysis of poverty status and dynamics and their contributing factors are complemented by qualitative findings from participatory activities. The results of the study pinpoint the successful contribution of the cooperative to the improvement of farmers' working conditions and market access and suggest that supporting collective action among berry farmers can be an effective rural development intervention to alleviate rural poverty and prevent poverty fallouts. To date, structural characteristics of farm holdings and households and climate and market-related conditions have significantly contributed to the farmers' poverty as well as to farmers’ exposure to poverty. Furthermore, bridging the gender gap is still a challenge in Bosnia and Herzegovina which should be addressed urgently to mitigate the problem of social exclusion and to promote bottom-up innovation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Smallholder farmers in developing countries encounter multiple barriers in access to inputs and technology, which prevent them from reaping the benefits from market participation. Women farmers face additional constraints due to gender norms that further limit their engagement in productive activities. While collective action has been shown to improve access to markets and economic outcomes for farmers overall, the evidence on the effects of cooperative membership for women smallholders remains limited. We investigate empirically the economic benefits of collective action for women farmers in the honey sector in Ethiopia. Relying on a rich data set on women honey producers, both cooperative members and non-members, we evaluate the effects of belonging to a cooperative on three outcome variables through coarsened exact matching and regression analysis. Our results indicate that cooperative membership significantly increases the market price and the production quantity and, while the average effect on the share of product marketed is statistically insignificant, significant differences emerge for women with given characteristics. These results are shown to be robust to a number of tests that address biases from selection on observables and unobservables. An analysis of the heterogeneous effects of household membership in multiple groups finds that membership of self-help groups or farmer associations amplifies the positive outcomes from belonging to a formal cooperative. Finally, qualitative findings derived from the same communities indicate self-reported improvements in agency and self-esteem among women members, thus reinforcing the importance of the quantitative findings. © 2020 The Agricultural Economics Society

AB  - The study aims to explore labor freedom in the agricultural sector for enhancing the efficiency of farming through policy change towards assigning property rights, rental contracts, and better wage-employment options to rural workers. Labor freedom emphasizes land reform and development policy for improving the economic status and capabilities of rural workers. The paper assessed the labor freedom index, weighted through agricultural property rights, labor wage contracts, and rural development policy. Data envelopment analysis is used to assess farm-level efficiency under the framework of Tobit regression for different size-based farm categories. Farm-level information was collected through a primary survey of 336 rural households of an advanced agricultural state in India. The study found a positive association between farm size and intensity of labor freedom, although the extent of freedom differs among farms. Size-specific variation was also observed for allocative efficiency such that marginal and medium-sized farms are more efficient than smaller ones. Tobit regression indicated labor freedom to be positively and significantly related to the efficiency of marginal, small and overall farms with enhancing efficiency of 25, 17 and nearly 20%, respectively; however, estimates of labor freedom insignificantly increased the efficiency of mediums farms, by 4.8%. This result suggests that labor freedom positive and significantly affects the efficiency of farms in general, and marginal and small farms in particular. Of course, the elasticity estimate of enhancing efficiency through labor freedom for medium farmers is found at a lower level. © 2021 Asian Economic and Social Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change has become a critical challenge to land productivity in developing countries. Adaptation strategies can increase farmers’ resilience to climate change in agricultural production. Many studies have explored how farmers adapted to climate change on the underlying premise that they homogeneously have a complete knowledge about climate change adaptation strategies. However, the knowledge of smallholder farmers can be incomplete and heterogeneous particularly under climatic shocks. And the role of social network in farmers’ adaptation decisions cannot be neglected. We specify social network into formal social tie (cooperative membership), and informal social tie (to local farmers and agricultural input retailers). This paper is the first attempt to examine the heterogeneous impact of social ties on farmers’ adaptation decisions, and further assess the effect of adaptation strategies on land productivity under climate change using Augmented Inverse Probability Weights (AIPW) estimator, based on the primary data collected from banana farmers in China. The results show that 55 percent of banana farmers adopted adaptation strategies to mitigate the impact of climate change in farming practices. Out of eight coping strategies, diversifying crops, increasing chemical use, increasing irrigation and planting trees were prioritized measures used by banana farmers. Both formal and informal social ties of farmers exerted a significant impact on farmers’ adaptation decisions. Participation in agricultural cooperatives and tie to agricultural input retailers increased farmers’ uptake rate of adaptation strategies. In contrast, tie to local farmers hindered farmers from taking active actions to combat climate change. We also found that the adaptation strategies significantly increased the land productivity of banana farmers. Interestingly, the land productivity of adopters was more influenced by the formal social tie (cooperative membership); while the informal social tie (to agricultural input retailers) affected that of non-adopters. These findings highlight the importance of different social ties of smallholder farmers in designing policy package to increase their responses to climate change and improve land productivity in developing regions. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The rural land rental market is playing an increasingly important role in the agricultural transformation period for developing countries, including China, where rural farmland rental is highly context-specific with the implementation of the collective-owned rural land system; thus, in turn, the access to farmland rental markets for rural households has profoundly influenced their livelihood strategies and income earnings. This paper investigates the income impact differences caused by rural households’ farmland rental participation activities and explores such impact mechanisms by further evaluating the income impacts caused by rental area and household agricultural productivity. Data from the Chinese national household survey were used for estimating the empirical models. Our results show that farmland renting has positively affected households’ on-farm and total income, but there is no significant effect upon off-farm income. According to income differences across quantiles, we find households with high on-farm income are more sensitive about enlarging their farm size by renting farmland, and households with middle and upper-middle off-income may benefit more from renting out their farmland. Furthermore, the joint effects of renting area and household agricultural productivity on lessee households’ farm income is significantly positive. For lessor households, our results indicate that renting out farmland did not improve their off-farm and total income as it may have a limited effect on farm household labor distribution. Our findings suggest that engaging in farmland rental activity can enhance farming productivity efficiency and poverty alleviation among rural households. Under the collective-owned rural land system, it is urgent and necessary to initiate and design incentive policies to encourage highly efficient large farms to expand the farm size and provide smallholders with equal opportunities to engage in farmland rental activities. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The food security paradigm shifted from diet quantity to diet quality and consumption of a satisfactory amount of micronutrients around the world. Low dietary diversification and imbalance consumption of food groups are the main characteristics of Iranian households. Food production diversity can be a significant determinant of dietary diversity in developing countries such as Iran. Thus, this research tries to examine the impact of food production diversity alongside the socioeconomic and sociodemographic determinants on dietary diversity in rural and urban areas of the country. For this aim, a panel data set is constructed based on all the available data in rural and urban areas of 31 provinces of Iran from 2011 to 2016 and panel quantile regression applied to investigate the impact of the control variables. The main results indicate that food production diversity, household income, the share of food in household expenditure, literacy rate have a positive and significant impact on the dietary diversity in rural and urban regions of the country. Moreover, the food price index has a negative and significant effect on dietary diversity in both regions. Finally, the age of head of household and family size only has a negative impact on diet diversification in rural areas. According to these results, encouraging small farmers to change their production patterns to a more diverse pattern in a short time, and pursuing multidimensional approaches such as the promotion of agricultural value chain should be considered by policymakers to improve the dietary diversity in rural and urban areas. Furthermore, the establishment of rural retirement found and redistribution of current income subsidy can help the elderly and extended family in rural areas to enhance their diet quality. Finally, design a price monitoring approach alongside a flexible trade strategy to manage the food market prices can help households to consume the appropriate diet with enough micronutrients. © 2021 Istituto Agronomico per l'Oltremare di Firenze.

AB  - Payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs use an incentive-based approach to pursue environmental goals. While they are common policy tools, key concepts determining their efficacy are nuanced and hard to grasp. This article presents a new interactive game that explores the functioning and implications of PES programs. Participants play the role of rural households in a developing country, deciding individually or as groups whether to enter into contracts to refrain from reducing local forests in exchange for payment from a forest-based PES initiative. The game explores topics that include PES programs, climate change, tropical deforestation, cost-effectiveness, additionality, illegal harvest and enforcement, and community resource management. Customizable materials, a detailed reading list, and discussion prompts are provided. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The improvement of agricultural productivity using technology is an important avenue for increasing output and reducing poverty in sub-Saharan countries. However, the low adoption of high yield varieties has been identified as one of the main reasons for low productivity in sub-Saharan Africa. Consequently, the study examined the effect of demographic, socioeconomic and institutional factors affecting adoption and adoption-intensity of improved wheat varieties (IWVs), using data obtained from randomly selected farm households in the Arsi Highland of Ethiopia. We estimated a Double hurdle model to analyze the determinants of the intensity of IWVs adoption, as adoption and use intensity were two independent decisions influenced by different factors. The results also show that Double hurdle model is more appropriate than the Tobit model. Empirical estimates of the first hurdle reveal that wheat farming experience, distance to cooperatives, renting a tractor and combine harvester, Urea application, and net income from the wheat grain sale all significantly increased the likelihood of IWVs adoption. Estimates of the second hurdle revealed that the decision to use the optimal intensity of IWVs by smallholder farmers was influenced by seed availability, row planting, and distance to cooperative all significantly and positively. The intensity of adoption was also found to be negatively related to the proportion of farmland allotted for wheat production. Accordingly, policies and interventions that are informed about such factors are required to accelerate the adoption and adoption-intensity of IWVs in Ethiopia to realize a wheat Green Revolution and fight food insecurity in a sustainable manner. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - A sample survey of palm oil smallholders was used to examine the amount of Willingness and Ability to Pay (WATP) and the factors that determine WATP as well as the impact of WATP on the willingness to participate of smallholders in Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certification scheme. Results reveal that the average amount of WATP accounted only half of the certification cost, implying that partial assistance is needed to support the smallholders through government subsidy. The study shows that WATP significantly affects the willingness to participate, and smallholders with higher WATP are more likely willing to participate in ISPO. Both WATP and willingness to participate are significantly determined by social norms (farmers collective impression) and awareness of the consequences of unsustainable farming practices. This result indicates the necessity to improve a positive impression on ISPO and increase awareness of the importance of following the sustainability principles of palm oil farming to increase the smallholders' WATP, and at the same time their willingness to participate in ISPO program. It is suggested for the government to intensify the campaign of the program to a wider range of smallholders to increase their knowledge and awareness of the certification program. © 2021 Dinda Dewi Aisyah et al., published by De Gruyter 2021.

AB  - Market-based initiatives like agriculture value chain (AVC) are becoming progressively pervasive to support smallholder rural farmers and assist them in entering larger market interventions and providing a pathway of enhancing their socioeconomic well-being. Moreover, it may also foster staggering effects towards the post-era poverty alleviation in rural areas and possessed a significant theoretical and practical influence for modern agricultural development. The prime objective of the study is to explore the effects of smallholder farmers’ participation in the agricultural value chain for availing rural development and poverty alleviation. Specifically, we have crafted the assessment employing pre-production (improved fertilizers usage), in-production (modern preservation technology), and post-production (supply chain) participation and interventions of smallholder farmers. The empirical data has been collected from a micro survey dataset of 623 kiwifruit farmers from July to September in Shaanxi, China. We have employed propensity score matching (PSM), probit, and OLS models to explore the multidimensional poverty reduction impact and heterogeneity of farmers’ participation in the agricultural value chain. The results show that the total number of poor farmers who have experienced one-dimensional and two-dimensional poverty is relatively high (66.3%). We also find that farmers’ participation in agricultural value chain activities has a significant poverty reduction effect. The multidimensional poverty level of farmers using improved fertilizer, organizational acquisition, and using storage technology (compared with non-participating farmers) decreased by 30.1%, 46.5%, and 25.0%, respectively. The multidimensional poverty reduction degree of male farmers using improved fertilizer and participating in the organizational acquisition is greater than that of women. The multidimensional poverty reduction degree of female farmers using storage and fresh-keeping technology has a greater impact than the males using storage and improved storage technology. Government should widely promote the value chain in the form of pre-harvest, production, and post-harvest technology. The public–private partnership should also be strengthened for availing innovative technologies and infrastructure development. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Colombia’s Santurbán páramo wetlands are vital water supply sources for highland communities’ livelihoods and downstream cities such as Bucaramanga. Nevertheless, they face strong degeneration because of large-scale mining extraction. Seeking to harmonize divergent interests between conservation policies, domestic water supply and mining–energy development, the national government laid out land-use zones and delimited use of the Santurbán páramo since 2014. This article illustrates how hydro-territorial tensions between the mining company, the government and citizen mobilizations for water end up fencing in the collective assets of smallholder páramo residents. To understand this complex enclosure process, we show how foreign mining capital interests, urban citizens’ claims for water and government ecological boundary-making paradoxically converge. Commensuration of water meanings and values, while bridging diverse worldviews, generates new enclosures of the commons. Engaging with the conceptualization of ‘hydrosocial territories’ and neoliberal reconfiguration politics, we contribute to debates on how modernist commensuration works to commodify water and territory, disqualifying peasants’ territorial self-governance. We conclude that Santurbán páramo residents’ hydro-territorial rights are subject to the interests of social forces competing for control over this páramo territory, whether to transfer rural water to cities or to establish large-scale mining. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper set out to show the impacts of COVID-19 and climate change on smallholders through the lens of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and ways to keep smallholders on the 2030 agenda. Descriptive statistical analysis of quantitative secondary data is applied to investigate the issues in question across world regions. Increasing energy and food demand have triggered greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with effects on the environment, socio-economic and related sectors. If unchecked, climate change will jeopardize progress towards SDGs’ agenda of ending hunger and poverty by 2030. COVID-19 exacerbates the underlying climate change impacts compromising food and water security. The widespread famines of Biblical proportions caused by COVID-19 effects are likely to cause more deaths than the virus. Improvement of water availability and food production is crucial to ending hunger and poverty. There is a need to strengthen smallholders’ adaptation and mitigation capacity through cooperatives’ platforms thereby reach out to smallholders who are the furthest first. International cooperation is urgent to support smallholders’ adaptation of climate-smart agriculture to reduce GHG emissions thereby subdue climate impacts resulting in higher productivity, food security, poverty reduction and sustainable development. Cooperatives need support to facilitate adaptation and mitigation by applying site-specific technology to local needs and possibilities. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this research is to determine the convenience of using a contract model as an integration mechanism for decision-making in a decentralized supply chain of small agricultural producers in a developing country, taking as hypothesis coordinated chain achieves better management. The analysis is based on information obtained by direct inquiry to 99 small producers in the region, about planning, production, marketing and distribution in the chain, supplemented with secondary information sources. Design/methodology/approach: As a methodology an analysis of maturity in the chain based on the Capability Maturity Model Integration is done, whose evaluation is later analyzed as a fuzzy logic model, with the support of the fuzzy logic of the MATLAB toolbox, to study the convenience of the use of the contract against the other mechanisms, and to establish an approximation to the level of readiness of the chain toward integration. Findings: Results obtained show that the small farmer supply chain studied, from a maturity perspective, has a strong disposition for the use of contracts as an integration mechanism. Research limitations/implications: The supply chain for small producers presents a high dispersion, little consolidated offer capacity and lack of coordination. Limitations in terms of information and criteria unification are a challenge for future research. Results have socioeconomic implications for small producers and can serve as a guide to formulate policies by the governments in Latin American countries. Practical implications: As practical implications, it can be stated that the use of supply contracts is a real mechanism that can be implemented in this type of chain, to break the mistrust between the echelons and improve the supply chain performance. This research will allow to establish support programs from local governments for the sustainability and improving income of small producers. In addition, contracts will allow to formalize the linkage of small producers to a sustainable commercial network. Social implications: Small agricultural producers in developing countries live in unfavorable conditions, with socioeconomic limitations. This work offers an alternative for their productive activity development that will allow them access to marketing chains in a safe way and improve their living conditions. Originality/value: Previous studies related to the maturity toward the chain integration and fuzzy logic as a hybrid methodology, were not found in the literature, and less even applied to a chain of small agricultural products. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Şanlıurfa is the province with the third-largest agricultural area in Turkey. However, it has only 0.62% of the total number of cooperatives in the country. This study aimed to determine the perceptionsof farmers in Şanlıurfa regarding agricultural cooperatives and the factors affecting them. The main research material was obtained through face-to-face surveys involving farmers in Şanlıurfa selected by a simple random sampling method. The sampling volume was determined with a 95% confidence limit and a 5% error margin. Multiple regression analysis was used in Stata software. According to the results of the research, 39.7% of the participants were cooperative members and more than half of them were not active members. Of the participants, 30.3% had a positive perception of cooperatives, 36.82% were undecided, and 32.88% had negative opinions. Age, marital status, non-agricultural income, experience, social security, farmer registration system, cooperative membership, and land variables positively affected farmers’ perceptions. However, the variables of education, income, and union membership had negative effects on farmers’ perceptions. No statistically significant relationship was reported between a farmer’s perception and any of the following variables: the number of people that make up the farmer’s household, the number of individuals engaged in agriculture and non-agricultural work in the family, and the status of the farmer’s lease. Conceptual, local, cultural, educational, and structural problems related to cooperatives exist in Şanlıurfa.These issues need to be given more attention by the public. This research is the first study on this subject to be conducted in Şanlıurfa. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main challenge with respect to water in the rural setting, lies in access, control and management. Collective action has been taken up following the International Water Management (IWM) principles and institutionalized in the Kenyan legal framework through water resource users’ associations (WRUAs). We carried out this study to assess whether this collective action has any impact on household poverty using objective poverty measures (consumption and income), a subjective poverty measure and a water poverty measure. We used 2019 household survey data of 652 randomly selected rural households from the Upper Ewaso Ng’iro North Catchment Area. We employed the full information maximum likelihood endogenous probit regression model to obtain the impact of WRUA membership on household poverty status. We find that collective water management can have welfare improving impacts for rural households, especially where there low public investments in water provision, management and access. We recommend that WRUAs be empowered through financial, legal and capacity building interventions to enhance their community impacts. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Rainfed farmers are among the most vulnerable farming communities to climate change in Pakistan because of the heavy reliance of crop farming on rain and of farmers’ livelihoods on crop farming. The best and most timely responses against climate change are suitable adaptation measures. Accurately perceiving the risks associated with climate change is an essential factor for planning and then implementing adaptations. Using farm household-level data of 400 rainfed farmers collected through a well-designed and field-tested questionnaire, this study examines the association between various adaptation stages (climate risk perceptions, adaptation planning, and implementation of adaptation) and their determinants using a multivariate probit (MVP) model. The findings indicate that farmers’ perceptions of climatic changes are in line with historical climatic data. Climate risk management (CRM) trainings and digital agriculture extension and communication (DAEC) services (indicators of formal institutional arrangements) show a highly significant impact on all adaptation stages. Input market distance, farmer cooperative meetings (an indicator of informal institutional arrangement), off-farm income, education, and number of male family members are among the other key determinants. A highly significant association between various adaptation stages indicates that accurate climate risk perceptions lead to planning and implementation of adaptations. When risk perceptions are underestimated or lacking, then adaptations do not occur. The results further indicate that the timely availability of reliable information on advanced agricultural inputs, weather parameters, crop farming advisory services, and market information could help rainfed farmers devise sound adaptations to minimize risks associated with climate change. The study recommends the provision of CRM trainings and DAEC services to provide a better understanding and promote sound adaptation planning through the adaptive capacity enhancement of rainfed farming communities for sustainable production and livelihood security. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - While contract farming and interlocked contractual arrangements (ICAs) are generally perceived to resolve persistent market failures and improve smallholder farmers' welfare in developing countries, uncertainties remain as to whether these arrangements enhance welfare because of farmers' low marketed volumes and margins. To account for potential selection bias, non-Gaussian and missing data problems, a robust two-stage Bayesian instrumental variable approach is used to determine the impact of dairy farmers' participation in ICAs on household income and milk revenue. Data are from smallholder dairy farmers in Zambia. We find that male household heads, wealth, experience selling to milk collection centres (MCCs), livestock holding, milking parlour ownership, landholding, and access to marketing information positively affect farmers' probability to participate in ICAs. However, increased off-farm income and distance to MCCs limit their participation. While some socioeconomic variables have significant positive effects of affecting ICA participation on household welfare, we find no sufficient evidence of causal effects of ICAs on household incomes and milk revenue among dairy farmers. Thus, while ICAs enhance smallholder farmers' access to markets, they may not address high rural poverty rates in developing countries. We provide some insights by which performance of ICAs in the dairy sector may be improved. © 2021 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.

AB  - This study examines the dynamics of integrated aquaculture-agriculture (IAA) value chain participation and assess the determinants of participation (non-participators, continuing participators, and leavers) using three wave panel data obtained from small-scale indigenous farm households in Northern and North-eastern region of Bangladesh. We employ panel estimation strategies to control for omitted variables and endogenous regressors. The results confirm some previous findings that educated, larger family size with better access to extension, market information and community-based organisation (CBO) are more likely to participate and continue in IAA value chain activities. Importantly, farm size and farm income does not matters for IAA value chain continuous participation, suggesting that IAA value chain activities are appropriate for resource-poor households who are only able to afford low-input technology. The results also indicate that the factors influencing continued participation and dis-participation of the IAA value chain activities especially for up and downstream activities are different. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The formation of agricultural cooperatives has been widely promoted as an agricultural development policy initiative to help smallholder farmers cope with multiple production and marketing challenges. Using a nationally representative survey dataset of smallholder maize producers from rural Nigeria, this study assesses the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on technical efficiency (TE). We based our estimation approach on the combination of a newly developed sample selection stochastic production frontier model with propensity score matching to control for possible selectivity biases from both observables and unobservables. We estimate stochastic meta-frontiers to examine TE differences between cooperative members and non-members. Our results reveal that TE levels of members are consistently higher than that of non-members. This calls for continued policy incentives targeted at encouraging farmers to form as well as participate in agricultural cooperatives. Copyright: © 2021 Olagunju et al.

AB  - This mixed methods study investigates the impact of introducing participatory intrahousehold decision making in Ugandan agricultural households on multiple dimensions of women’s empowerment, including more subjective aspects of sense of agency and achievements by examining how impact aligns with women’s perceptions of the process, meaning and value of their empowerment. Participatory intrahousehold decision making is expected to empower women through increasing their voice and decision-making power and reducing collective action problems within households, which compromise efficiency and equitable sharing of costs and benefits of household farming. Couple seminars raising awareness about participatory intrahousehold decision making promoted women’s involvement in strategic farm and household decisions, highly aspired and valued by women to actively contribute to their households’ welfare. This may facilitate the pathway to empowerment where women have some leeway to participate in strategic household affairs. Couple seminars made improvement in household welfare more likely. This is an achievement in itself with great meaning to women as it answers to their priorities and sense of agency. Introducing participatory intrahousehold decision making by an additional intensive coaching of couples contributed to women’s priority of enhanced access to household coffee income, only feasible in the pathway with room for participation in household affairs. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Contract farming is typically seen as a useful mechanism to help smallholders in overcoming market access constraints. However, in spite of economic benefits, high smallholder dropout rates from contract schemes are commonplace. We use quantitative and qualitative data from Ghana to show that smallholder farmers benefit from a resource-providing contract in terms of higher yields and incomes, but that most of them still regret their decision to participate in the contract scheme and would prefer to exit if they could. The analysis underlines that research focusing on narrowly defined economic indicators alone cannot explain farmers’ satisfaction with contracts and their dropout behaviour. The main problem in the contract scheme is insufficient information provided by the company. Farmers do not understand all the contract details, which leads to substantial mistrust. Farmers believe that the company behaves opportunistically, for instance during the output weighing procedure, and these beliefs are significantly correlated with the farmers’ wish to exit. We conclude that issues of mistrust and lack of transparency can contribute to breakdowns of smallholder contract schemes and that such issues should receive more attention in future research on contract farming. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Farmers globally are facing challenges associated with climate variability and change. In Haiti, where agriculture is predominantly non-mechanized and rainfed, smallholder farmers are severely affected by reduced yields and increases in operating costs. We evaluate the Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture (PICSA) approach with farmers who live in mountainous areas outside of Port-au-Prince ahead of the 2019 spring growing season. We use quantitative surveys and qualitative case studies to measure farmers' understanding and use of PICSA information and tools, and perceived effects on their farming and households. Seventy percent of survey respondents (63% women) reported that training in PICSA led them to make positive changes in their farming and livelihood enterprises. While most of the changes pertained to the management of existing farming enterprises, farmers also made changes in scale and started new enterprises. The analysis of qualitative case studies provides an in-depth understanding of perceived benefits on farmers' income, food security, confidence and their attitudes towards farming and climate risk. PICSA builds farmers’ self-efficacy by enabling them to focus and reflect on their individual context while collectively analyzing and interpreting relevant information on climate and livelihood options. This study has important implications for future adaptation interventions where extension services and climate information are limited. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Extraction of environmental resources and migration are closely related livelihood strategies of rural households in developing countries. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the relationship between environmental income and remittances is needed to lower the existing pressure on environmental resources and to promote rural development. This study aims at investigating this relationship by using panel data at the household and village levels collected in 2013, 2016, and 2017 from three provinces in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. A Heckman model is applied to identify the factors of the decision to send remittances. A fixed effects two-stage least squares analysis is conducted to investigate the determinants of environmental income and a quantile regression shows the distribution of effects. The findings reveal differences between asset-poor and -rich households. Since the former are often more dependent on labour-intensive livelihood strategies such as extraction, a decrease in household labour due to migration leads to reduced extraction. For asset-rich households who are normally less capital-constrained, remittances lead to more extraction of natural resources. The findings support the claim for encouraging rural labour markets and education, especially for asset-poor people, and for a sustainable and collective natural resource management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Contract farming schemes have recently been portrayed by global development agencies as an alternative to ‘land grabs’, promoting processes of inclusive development through the integration of smallholders within global agro-industrial production complexes. The paper takes issue with such argument, using the case-study of contract farming scheme at Kakira Sugar Works in Uganda as empirical terrain for this investigation. It argues that despite contract farming schemes at first sight appear not to generate dispossession or displacement, they lead to forms of expulsion and/or marginalization of poor smallholders from sugar agro-poles through social differentiation. It also maintains that rather than being the antithesis to land enclosures, contract farming represents one instance of global neoliberal agricultural restructuring, functional to the expansion of the sugar frontier at cheap costs. This process, which I term sugarification, involves the maximization of value extraction from farmers, its appropriation by agribusiness and finance capital, and a regime of production which devaluates labour (wage and family) and nature, while dramatically affecting existing livelihoods and landscapes. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The expansion of monocultures across New World tropical landscapes threatens an Afrodescendant smallholder farming system that has long prioritized agrobiodiversity and agroecological practices. These practices emerged during the plantation era, when slaves leveraged subsistence precarity for the right to food plots, independent production, and partial autonomy over their labor. Historical continuities connect this subaltern food system to the agricultural repertoires maintained by present-day Afrodescendant smallholders. The landscapes that collectively embody the plants, practical and cultural knowledge, and social memories held by these communities are recognizable as bio-cultural refugia, extending to the New World tropics a concept validating European heritage landscapes. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The inevitable desire for productive and remunerative agriculture with zero negative impact both on the environment and the natural resource base (natural systems) in the quest to mitigate the impact of climate extremes on the agri-food ecosystem, farming households' welfare, and food security status in Nigeria, necessitates farmers' adoption of eco-friendly agricultural practices (conservation agricultural practices) which are adjudged to be climate-smart. These practices are confluence in nature, interrelated and mutually enabling, with specific trade-offs. Households' survey data from the randomly selected 350 smallholder farmers were analyzed with heterogeneous treatment effect econometrics model to investigate farmers' adoption status of eco-friendly agricultural practices, and to find out if farmers' adoption decision have impact on their welfare gains. Bearing in mind that, many of the previous related studies on adoption of improved agricultural practices in South-west Nigeria seemed not to have accounted for the possible selection and hidden bias usually associated with non-experimental research of this nature. The findings indicated that adoption is still largely partial. Similarly, the results revealed that adoption had a welfare-increasing impact for every change in the rank of the propensity score. However, years of formal education, trust index of social capital, active involvement in collective action, and frequent extension delivery system were found to significantly predict adoption of these practices. These important dynamics also differentiated the adopters and non-adopters of these practices by welfare-gains. Importantly, rosenbaum sensitivity test used for robustness checks revealed that the negative effect of adoption on farmers' welfare-gains was insensitive to selection bias. Hence, the ATT estimate from HTE model was a pure impact effect of the adoption. The study concluded that a large proportion of the farmers with a high propensity to adopt these practices were perhaps the ones with high comparative advantage as regards access to productive resources, which included: farmland holdings, labour, capital, social networks, and institutional supports. This also permits to infer that there is a possibility for the farmers to perform better to experience positive effects, if efficient enough to stay within the production possibility frontier. © 2020.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic had an enormous impact on the vegetable supply chain in China. Effective evaluation of the pandemic's influences on vegetable production is vital for policy settings to enhance the security of vegetable supply. Based on first-hand data from 526 households, we explored regional differences in different types of loss and potential factors affecting the severity farmer households suffered during the pandemic. The results underline that sales contraction and price volatility in the context of interruption of supply chain dominate the total losses during the pandemic. Such losses differ across provinces and are more substantial in provinces with stricter confinement measures. Farmer households' participation in local market and modern marketing methods helps mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 shock, while labor hiring and facilities adoption in production widen the losses due to the shortage in the workforce. In the future, the vegetable industry practitioners and relevant government departments should work together to coordinate the development of short and long supply chains and strengthen the stability and security of the vegetable supply chain. © 2020 CAAS.

AB  - With the increasing participation of women in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) across many sub-Saharan African countries, the ASM sector offers women artisanal miners considerable income that gives them better opportunities at household decision-making. While the existing literature has widely studied intrahousehold dynamics in domains such as agriculture and health, very little is known about the bargaining power of women in ASM and their household dynamics. Through in-depth interviews with 49 women artisanal miners in Prestea-Bondaye mining area in the Prestea-Huni Valley Municipality of Ghana, this paper considers how women's engagement in ASM changes the dynamics within their households and impacts their bargaining power. Findings showed that most women artisanal miners were not in support of pooling income with their husbands with most of them using their income to alter the dynamics of household decision-making concerning food to cook for the family, children's education and family size. Extended family relations as a form of social norm were found to determine women artisanal miners' decision not to pool income with their husbands. The findings, therefore, problematise the unitary model of household decision-making and provide a nuanced analysis of rural household power dynamics in a mining context, which is grossly unexplored. However, various aspects of intrahousehold bargaining models – cooperative, non-cooperative and collective – were found under different circumstances depending on the household needs and artisanal women miners' relations with husbands and their extended family. Findings also showed that women's participation in ASM was changing household dynamics, particularly sexual interactions with their partners and childcare responsibilities. Although women's participation in ASM results in higher levels of bargaining power, the Minerals Commission of Ghana, gender advocacy institutions and other relevant stakeholders must engage in policy discussions to streamline women's activities and find possible ways of dealing with their challenges in the sector. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Papua New Guinea is an economic leader in the Pacific region via its extractive resources. However, these industries do not provide employment opportunities for the country's 6.4 million (80% of total population) rural inhabitants. Rural nonfarm enterprises (NFEs) could offer an additional source of structural change, whereby benefits are capitalized by domestic rural and urban households along the value chain. In 2018, we administered a survey to over 1000 households to gauge whether households with NFEs afford better diets. We examine the factors associated with NFE ownership using a multinomial logit (MNL) framework. We then evaluate whether welfare effects differ by the sex of the NFE owner using nearest neighbor matching to address selection into NFE ownership. Results suggest households with a NFE obtain greater levels of consumption on the order of 26% for protein per person, 11% for kilocalories per person, 13% for total yearly expenditures per person, and 10% for household dietary diversity. Results point to the resounding limitations of female-owned NFEs primarily created to cope with income risk. The findings highlight the relevance of NFEs as a poverty reduction strategy and the importance of targeting when promoting in-country entrepreneurship. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Brazilian small-scale farmers are seeking new types of collaborations and economic opportunities amid a changing world. Market opportunities, however, have incurred demanding environmental, financial and labor requirements, and created trade-offs between expanding cash crops and maintaining livelihood security. We analyze the Tomé-Açu region in the Brazilian Amazon, where different collaborative models between small-scale farmers and other social agents (industries, government, non-governmental organizations) have emerged. Local farmers are engaging in collective actions and pursuing different types of partnerships, which facilitate knowledge exchange and access to market niches, also helping them overcome the infrastructural and logistical deficiencies that have historically limited rural development in the region. In particular, we discuss the diffusion and adoption of agroforestry and oil palm production systems among small-scale farmers. We examine the challenges and opportunities these partnerships and social innovations have created for local farmers, who are part of heterogeneous groups with distinct roles, assets and contexts. The state-led oil palm program posed challenges to small-scale farmers who experienced asymmetrical relationships within their partnership with private companies. On the other hand, the farmer-led agroforestry model opened new opportunities for farmers who had more flexibility in deciding their production arrangements, developing new agroforestry techniques, and pursuing commercialization pathways. Despite their limited power, small-scale farmers have been able to overcome some structural barriers through innovations, entrepreneurship, and renegotiation of oil palm contract farming. Thus, their ability to engage in both farmer-led agroforestry and state-led oil palm programs provides concrete examples of the potential of local governance based on collaborative arrangements to support sustainable farming production systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study analyzed the adequacy between credit supply and the expectations of rice farmers in Central Benin to define policies for improved agricultural-oriented financial services. A survey was conducted in October 2016 among 120 rice farmers randomly selected from six rice-farming villages. Data collected through structured and semi-structured interviews included the financial services offered by Microfinance Institutions, socio-demographic characteristics of rice farmers, their expectations and perception. Multivariate analysis combining hierarchical ascending cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to define the distinct groups of rice farmers according to their credit expectations. The unmet expectations of rice farmers for a credit scheme that suits their needs were identified based on the gaps between their expectations and perception. There were three rice farmers’ clusters with distinct characteristics based on their expectations. These farmers were not satisfied with all the attributes of the current credit scheme. Pending the effectiveness of the agricultural bank, the approaches such as the inventory credit system are useful in facilitating credit access to smallholder farmers. It is also essential to combine credit supply with financial education and technical support in a system such as contract farming. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Smallholder farmers in developing countries often suffer from high risk and limited market access. Contract farming may improve the situation under certain conditions. Several studies analyzed effects of contracts on smallholder productivity and income with mixed results. Most existing studies focused on one particular contract scheme. Contract characteristics rarely differ within one scheme, so little is known about how different contract characteristics may influence the benefits for smallholders. Here, we address this research gap using data from oil palm farmers in Ghana who participate in different contract schemes. Some of the farmers have simple marketing contracts, while others have resource-providing contracts where the buyer also offers inputs and technical services on credit. A comparison group cultivates oil palm without any contract. Regression models that control for selection bias show that resource-providing contracts increase farmers’ input use and yield. Resource-providing contracts also incentivize higher levels of specialization and an increase in the scale of production. These effects are especially pronounced for small and medium-sized farms. In contrast, the marketing contracts have no significant effects on input use, productivity, and scale of production. The results suggest that resource-providing contracts alleviate market access constraints, while simple marketing contracts do not in this context. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The rapid development of information communication technology (ICT), represented by mobile phones and the Internet, allows capitalizing to a greater extent on the wealth of information and knowledge available for agriculture knowledge and can be used to increase production, conserve the environment, etc. This study analyzes the current market-oriented behavioral effects of information communication technologies on farmers, based on data of 1263 rural households in two highly environmentally affected and major vegetable producing provinces—Shandong and Hebei. A probit model was used to analyze the impact of information communication technology on the choice of farmers’ sales channels. The results show that the differences between the farm households with and without access to ICT, as well as those who actively or passively acquire information, have a significant impact on the choice of sales channels. Using ICT increases the probability that farmers choose sales through middlemen and cooperatives and reduces the probability of self-sales. Actively acquiring information has a positive impact on the cooperative channel choice and a significant negative impact on self-sales. Accordingly, we recommend that the government should increase the penetration rate of ICT, strengthen the information technology in rural areas, emphasize the construction of information sources, such as the collection and distribution of market information, enhance information literacy among farmers, reduce their transaction costs, and increase overall farmer participation in the market. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The study assessed the impact of climate change adaptation strategies on technical efficiency of smallholder rice farmers in South-west Nigeria. An endogeneity corrected stochastic frontier model which account for the endogeneity of adoption of adaptation strategies that is likely to depend on inefficiency was employed for the study. The result of the study revealed that adoption of adaption strategies is endogenously determined with rice productivity and hence, failure to account for endogeneity, the parameter efficiency estimates would be inconsistent. The empirical results from the model show that quantity of labour, herbicides and the interaction of labour with both farm size and insecticides were statistically significant in explaining the variations in the efficiency of rice production in the study area. In addition, the study identified the combined effects of climate change adaptation strategies and some socioeconomic characteristics such as age, gender, education, farming experience, access to credit, access to information, membership of farmers in agricultural based cooperative and location of rice farmers as sources of technical inefficiencies. The study concluded that increase implementation of climate change adaptation strategies could enhance rice productivity and technical efficiency of rice farmers through timely access to climate change information and other related institutional support. Based on farmers' knowledge and understanding of changes in climatic conditions and the adaptation strategies to mitigate its effect, it is therefore important for the government, stakeholders and donor agencies to involve farmers in the climate change adaptation planning process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The government of Kazakhstan is currently developing strategies and policies to stimulate milk production at an industrial production level to increase milk processing capacity. We use and expand the reasoned action approach as a framework to study the factors underlying the rural household’s motivation to participate in a governmental programme aimed at increasing rural cooperative production in Kazakhstan to increase milk production using primary data acquired from 181 randomly selected dairy households in the Akmola region of Kazakhstan. We account for the rural household’s psychological factors and socio-demographic characteristics along with the household’s risk attitudes, production structure, level of information about the government support programme and cooperatives, cultural aspects as well as the household’s proximity to the main market. A bivariate probit model is used to jointly estimate the impact of these factors on the rural household’s intention to join and create a cooperative. The results show that rural households which hold positive views towards cooperatives, have a relatively high production capacity, are aware/know of cooperatives, and do not have a dairy business as a source of household income are relatively keen to participate in collective actions. Perceived social norms and household risk attitudes also play a significant role in the rural household’s intention to participate in collective actions. Finally, gender and nationality are found to be positively associated with joining and creating a cooperative, while higher educated rural households are found to be less motivated to participate in the programme. In order to stimulate milk production at an industrial production level through a policy that encourages collective action, we recommend a policy that (a) supports rural households which have the capacity to produce and are in need; (b) is attractive to rural households which consider dairy as a source of income; and (c) is well disseminated and well explained to the targeted rural households. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food and nutrition security and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. This requires that small-scale producers be included in, and benefit from, the rapid growth and transformation under way in food systems. Small-scale producers interact with various actors when they link with markets, including product traders, logistics firms, processors and retailers. The literature has explored primarily how large firms interact with farmers through formal contracts and resource provision arrangements. Although important, contracts constitute a very small share of smallholder market interactions. There has been little exploration of whether non-contract interactions between small farmers and both small- and large-scale value chain actors have affected small farmers’ livelihoods. This scoping review covers 202 studies on that topic. We find that non-contract interactions, de facto mostly with small and medium enterprises, benefit small-scale producers via similar mechanisms that the literature has previously credited to large firms. Small and medium enterprises, not just large enterprises, address idiosyncratic market failures and asset shortfalls of small-scale producers by providing them, through informal arrangements, with complementary services such as input provision, credit, information and logistics. Providing these services directly supports Sustainable Development Goal 2 by improving farmer welfare through technology adoption and greater productivity. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The objective of this study is to identify and explain the underlying patterns for rural collective action based on the practices of rural construction land consolidation (RCLC) in contemporary China. To that end, an analytical framework is developed to decompose rural collective action into diagnostic attributes, design attributes and outcomes. Then, an archetype analysis is performed, and a total of eight patterns regarding the collective action for RCLC are extracted from 30 first-hand cases in eastern, central and western China. These patterns jointly demonstrate that the alignment between the diagnostic attributes of rural construction land and rural households and the design attributes of institutional mechanisms contributes to the collective action for RCLC. The research findings corroborate the classic theoretical propositions of rural collective action, including small group size, coercive power, exclusive incentives and unequal interest. More importantly, several distinctive implications are drawn: 1) the sizes, locations and quality of rural construction land raise governance demand or create favorable conditions for rural collective action; 2) despite the small group size, the government and enterprises, as external actors, still engage in RCLC motivated by their political and economic goals in the transitional context of China, and they contribute to divergent pathways to rural collective action; 3) self-governance mechanisms consisting of community control, decision-making and coordination differ to prevent opportunistic behavior, mitigate conflicts of interest and reach consensus, depending on group sizes, whether RCLC is implemented within a village group or an administrative village as well as the extent to which the social capital accumulates in a rural community; 4) given the small group size but the large area of rural construction land involved, government participation or the formal and institutionalized self-governance mechanisms with powerful rural leadership can overcome “the tragedy of the anticommons”. In general, this study provides new insights into land-related rural collective action and references for subsequent research on other types of rural collective action or in other transitional countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rice production is an increasing source of income and food security for smallholder farmers in many parts of Tanzania. Improving market access for rice farmers is essential to raise rural incomes and reduce poverty. This paper aims to determine the most efficient rice marketing channel and analyse the factors affecting marketing channel choices by smallholder rice farmers. Marketing efficiency was tested using Acharya and Aggarwal's composite index method. A multinomial logit model was used to analyse the marketing channel choices. The results showed that the miller–wholesaler marketing channel is the most efficient. The results show that most farmers in rural areas still sell their rice to local collectors because of failure, fear or inability by farmers to venture out of the farm gate into the markets. The findings suggest that there is a need to improve rural infrastructure, market information systems, smallholder access to productive assets, prudent use of credit and strengthening collective action through well-organised farmer groups in the country. © 2020 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.

AB  - Purpose: This document analyses farmers' preferences and willingness to pay (CAP) for microcredit, in order to facilitate their access in rural areas. Design/methodology/approach: Data are based on a discrete choice experiment with 400 randomly selected farmers from 20 villages of the 7 Benin agricultural development hubs (ADHs). The preference choice modelling was performed using mixed logit (MXL) and latent class logit (LCL) models. Farmers' willingness to pay for each preferred attribute was estimated. The endogenous attribute attendance (EAA) model was also used to capture attribute non-attendance (ANA) phenomenon. Findings: The results indicate that, on average, farmers prefer individual loans, low interest rates, in kind + cash loans, cash loans, disbursement before planting and loans with at least 10-month duration. These preferences vary according to farmers' classes. Farmers are willing to pay higher or lower interest rates depending on attribute importance. The estimate of the EAA model indicates that, when taking the ANA phenomenon into consideration, people will show stronger attitudes regarding WTP for important factors. Research limitations/implications: Based on these results from Benin, microfinance institutions (MFIs) in developing countries can, based on the interest rates currently charged, attract more farmers as customers, reviewing the combination of the levels of the attributes associated with the nature of the loan, the type of loan (individual or collective), the disbursement period of funds, the waiting period of the loan and the loan duration. However, the study only considered production credit, ignoring equipment or investment credit. Practical implications: The document provides information on the key factors that can facilitate producers' access to MFI products and services. Social implications: Facilitating small farmers' access to financial service will contribute to poverty reduction. Originality/value: This research contributes to the knowledge of the attributes and attribute levels favoured by farmers when choosing financial products and the amounts they agree to pay for these attributes. The implementation of the results would facilitate small producers' access to financial services; thus contributing to poverty reduction. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Rapid transformation of agrifood value chains because of population growth, urbanization, rising consumer incomes and increased demand for food quality and safety has resulted in the need for smallholder farmers to coordinate horizontally through group formation and collective marketing to improve farm performance in developing countries. This paper aims to examine the factors that influence farmer group membership and collective marketing decisions and their impacts on smallholder farm performance in rural Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from a recent survey of 447 rice farmers in rural Ghana, an endogenous switching regression model is employed to account for selection bias arising from both observable and unobservable farmer attributes. Findings: The data reveal that group members and collective marketing participants obtained higher prices and also incurred lower input costs. The econometric estimates show that age, access to credit, mobile phone ownership, distance to market and road status are the main drivers of group membership and collective marketing decisions. The authors also find positive and significant impacts of farmer group membership and collective marketing on farm net revenues. Research limitations/implications: The findings from this study suggest that government and donor support for the formation of farmer groups during implementation of agriculture and value chain interventions should as well incorporate strategies to facilitate collective marketing. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to examine the role farmer groups and collective marketing play in improving smallholder farm performance. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study is focused on understanding sources and patterns of vulnerability of wheat smallholder farmers in Northeast Iran. We conducted a farm household survey and recorded multiple environmental and socio-economic attributes of 391 wheat smallholder farmers. A Vulnerability Scoping Diagram and Principal Component Analysis served to identify key factors determining wheat farmer's vulnerability. Also, we performed a cluster analysis to classify wheat farmers into three vulnerability types. Although drought affects all types as main environmental stressor, only for Cluster 2 was it the key vulnerability factor. For Clusters 1 and 3 socio-economic vulnerability components prevailed: for farmers categorized in Cluster 1 land consolidation was the main problem, while the current wheat import policy was the key problem for Cluster 3 farmers. Multiple tailored policies are needed that reduce the vulnerability of wheat farmers in all clusters. Supportive government policies should for example focus on avoiding price distortions from wheat imports for Cluster 3, land consolidation for Cluster 1 and collective tackling of pests and weeds for Cluster 2. Simultaneous provision of farm advisory services will benefit farmers of Clusters 1 and 3, while availability of improved seeds (drought-tolerant varieties) and other inputs will lower the environmental vulnerability of all farmers. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Private sustainability standards are spreading rapidly in global value chains, especially in the coffee sector, and commonly aim at promoting environmental, economic and social sustainability. The social sustainability component is often overlooked in studies on the impact of private standards. In this paper, we investigate a particular social outcome and analyse how adoption of private sustainability standards affects the welfare of children in coffee-producing farm-households in Ethiopia and Uganda. We specifically analyse school enrolment and schooling efficiency of primary and secondary school-aged children. We find that participation in Fairtrade certification schemes increases the likelihood of children to be enrolled in secondary school and improves their schooling efficiency, although it is not associated with higher incomes nor with a reduced child labour time in the farm-household. We find that participation in Rainforest Alliance certification schemes has no effect on schooling outcomes of boys and slightly reduces the schooling of girls, while it does correlate with higher incomes and a reduced workload of children. Results suggest that effects on schooling emerge through social capital and awareness-raising about the importance of schooling among Fairtrade certified households, rather than from the mere prohibition of child labour and the enforcement of a child-labour-free production process. © 2020

AB  - Land tenure security, especially customary residence systems, is found to influence the agricultural investment decision-making and productivity of smallholder farmers across sub-Saharan Africa. However, as country-specific customary residence systems and farming models evolve over time, their impact on food security and livelihood remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of customary residence systems on both agricultural investment (in tea shrubs and agroforestry) and productivity among contracted smallholder tea outgrowers in Southern Malawi. A survey of 228 farmers was conducted in 2018, and a linear probability and ordinary least squared (OLS) models were used for the analysis. The results suggest that matrilocal residence practices positively influence agricultural investment. The study concluded that despite the dominance of matrilineal-matrilocal systems in Southern Malawi, there is a need for policy to address gender gaps in the region because women are still vulnerable and insecure even in these assumed women-friendly customary systems. It is recommended that future research explores other prevailing tenure security systems. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Risk management is an essential way for farmers to reduce uncertainty. In this research, a stratified random sampling method was used to survey 350 maize farmers in four different agro-ecological regions in Bangladesh. Using the multivariate probit model, this study explored the possible correlation between farmers’ perceptions of catastrophic risks and their attitudes towards risk sources—as well as the possible correlation between contract farming, diversification and precautionary savings as risk management strategies. The results confirm the relevance of risk management adoption decisions and reveal that the use of one risk management tool may simultaneously influence the use of another risk management tool. In addition, the research results also show that age, education level, extension experience, monthly household income, farming areas, land ownership and risk aversion nature are the most important factors that affect the adoption of risk management strategies. The research results provide further explanation and information and provide a platform for decision-makers to predict appropriate risk management strategies. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Developing a conceptual model is vital for small-scale organic farmer's credit access to sustain the livelihoods. However, smallholders continually face severe problems in getting finance that lead to reduce investment and in turn, challenges the livelihoods. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to establish and empirically test a theoretical model to explore how agility and innovativeness in organic food value chain finance are achieved through ITI, TRST, CG, ICT, and IS, and how these, in turn, can accelerate financial flow in the value chain and enhance competitiveness. The present study used a survey method and collected data from small-scale farmers, traders, and financial institutions. The model and hypothesis are tested using data obtained from 331 respondents through partial least square structure equation modeling techniques. We argue that development of theoretical model show potential to increase creditworthiness of smallholders and overcome uncertainties that impede traditional value chain credit arrangement. Thus, the present study could provide new ways to integrate the value chain partners, through information and communication technology and governance arrangements in the organic food value chain financing. This study demonstrates that the mediations of innovativeness and agility significantly affect the development of new financial products to make agile the financial flow, which in turn positively influences value chain competitiveness. Significant judgments are required for trustworthy relations among the value chain partners to positively harness innovative product development for swifter value chain finance. Therefore, this theoretical model should not be regarded as a quick solution, but a process of testing, error, and learning by doing so. © 2020 Abid et al.

AB  - As the result of prohibitively high transaction costs, smallholder farmers are only partly integrated into agricultural and forest commodity markets, a situation that may leave them in a lower level of development equilibrium (i.e., a poverty trap). For the most part, many users of forest commons extract forest products, typically non-timber products, for subsistence use or safety net purposes. To overcome this problem, in recent years, collective vertical integration (VI) of forest product marketing cooperative structures have been promoted and, in some cases, adopted by users of forest commons. Although this type of program has been observed to raise smallholder incomes, there is little evidence available on saving/investment responses to such income gains. This paper investigates precautionary saving and investment responses to collective forest product marketing programs among users of forest commons in Ethiopian villages. To identify the causal effects of the program, I applied propensity score matching, difference-in-difference (DID) and change-in-change (CIC) estimators to household survey data collected from randomly selected households in the Gimbo district (south-western Ethiopia). I find strong evidence that participation in the program reduces savings in the form of livestock holdings and that effect is limited to non-poor households. When interpreted in terms of the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH), the results imply that participants felt the current income gains to be non-transient, which led to reduced precautionary savings and to a gain in consumption/welfare. Moreover, I found that the program has spurred investment in child education and participation in off-farm self-employment. These results point to the importance of the safety net/insurance channel of the program. Overall, the findings underscore the program's potential to raise the standard of living via ancillary mechanisms beyond directly raising income outcome. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Farmer cooperatives may promote technology adoption in agricultural production, which, in turn, increases crop productivity and farmers' income. However, empirical evidence of how and to what extent cooperatives facilitate the technology adoption extensity, defined as the number of technologies adopted by a farmer from a wide range of agricultural technologies, remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we examine the impact of cooperative membership on the technology adoption extensity using cross-sectional data collected from 413 farm households in Sichuan province of China. We use propensity score matching combined with an instrumental variable approach to address the sample selection bias associated with voluntary cooperative membership choice. The statistical results suggest that cooperative membership has a positive effect on the technology adoption extensity when all 13 surveyed technologies are considered. However, the separate analyses on the adoption of production and post-harvest technologies reveal that cooperative membership has an insignificant impact on the number of adopted production technologies, but it significantly increases the number of post-harvest technologies adopted. These empirical findings are in line with the new institutional economics theories and our observations on the ground. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: Even though many studies identify positive effects of contract farming (CF) on the livelihood of farmers, the use of CF as a tool to increase farm performance is unsettled debate. Information on CF is relatively not available in staple food chains. Theoretical considerations have shown that there are challenges in employing CF in staple food chains such as rice. With the increasing trend of rice CF in Ghana, it is very critical to establish its performance in rice production in Ghana. It is therefore imperative to analyse the impact of CF on the performance of smallholder rice farmers. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted where 350 rice farmers selected through a stratified sampling technique using structured questionnaires were interviewed. Descriptive and inferential statistics including stochastic frontier analyses and endogenous treatment effect regression were used to analyse the data. Findings: The results from the endogenous treatment effect regression model show that CF improves rice farmers' technical, allocative and economic efficiencies by 21, 23 and 26%, respectively. Farm size and CF were identified as common factors influencing technical, allocative and economic efficiency measures of the farmers positively. It further identified age of farmer, educational level and household labour as factors influencing farmers' participation in CF positively. Research limitations/implications: It is recommended that CF is a good tool to enhance rice production efficiency, and hence, farmers should be encouraged to participate in CF as strategy to enhance the local rice production in Ghana. Social implications: The outcome of this study has the potential to influence rice production in the country. The country is a net importer of rice and just about 35% self-sufficient in rice production. Originality/value: This study is the first to assess performance of CF in rice crop production in Ghana and also one of the few to use efficiency as a performance measure. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Commercial transformation of smallholder agriculture entails production decisions based on market signals and significant participation in output markets. Consequently, this research attempts to contribute to the understanding of smallholder commercialization of mango production and analyzing factors determining the extent of smallholders’ participation in output market. The study was based on the cross-sectional data collected from 150 sample households which were randomly selected from 6 rural kebeles. Both descriptive statistics and econometric analysis were used to identify and analyze factors that determine the extent of smallholders’ participation in output market. Accordingly, out of the included 16 variables, 10 were found to significantly influence the quantity of mango sold. The Tobit truncated regression model results showed that the determinant of mango volume of sale includes resources ownership (land allocated for mango and land fragmentation), households assets ownership (number of productive mango trees and mango seedling availability), access to institutions (farmers club membership), social-network (critical support from non-relatives within the village and brokers), and economic (previous income from mango sale, Income from livestock sale, and mango market price) are the significant determinants of mango market participation. Given the current high market demand for Assosa mango, there is a room to enhance the level of mango commercialization, thereby enhancing mango market participation. To improve quantity of mango sold policies and development, endeavors must target at improving household resource endowment, creating market linkage and synergy among mango value-chain actors, and strengthening the existing mango nursery sites and infra-structure. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Food security, at national and household levels, is on the decline because traditional capital (physical, natural, human and financial) has not fully led to its improvement. There is an increasing shift of attention to social capital as an element that explains household food security, but there is a lack of adequately documented information on this. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of social capital on food security, using data collected on a cross-section of 775 cassava farming households from four zones of Nigeria. About 58% of the respondents (cassava farming households) fall under the intermediate category in terms of the benefits received from belonging in social groups. Age and educational level increased the probability to receive benefit from group activities (p < 0.05), while membership density, labor contribution and decision making significantly affected the level of benefit received (p < 0.10). Based on the estimated food security line, 41% of the cassava households were food secure, while 59% were food insecure. Membership density, cash and labor contribution significantly affected food security. Membership density (p < 0.10) and cash contribution (p < 0.05) increased the probability of being food secure. It was recommended that cassava farming households should be encouraged or aided to form cooperatives or farmers' groups, participate in the activities, and make financial contributions to investments that reduce manual labor-input in the farming activities to enhance household food security. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate identification of crop varieties grown by farmers is crucial, among others, for crop management, food security and varietal development and dissemination purposes. One may expect varietal identification to be more challenging in the context of developing countries where literacy and education are limited and informal seed systems and seed recycling are common. This paper evaluates the extent to which smallholder farmers misidentify their wheat varieties in Ethiopia and explores the associated factors and their implications. The study uses data from a nationally representative wheat growing sample household survey and DNA fingerprinting of seed samples from 3,884 wheat plots in major wheat growing zones of Ethiopia. 28-34% of the farmers correctly identified their wheat varieties. Correct identification was positively associated with farmer education and seed purchases from trusted sources (cooperatives or known farmers) and negatively associated with seed recycling. Farmers' varietal identification thereby is problematic and leads to erroneous results in adoption and impact assessments. DNA fingerprinting can enhance varietal identification but remains mute in the identification of contextual and explanatory factors. Thus, combining household survey and DNA fingerprinting approaches is needed for reliable varietal adoption and impact assessments, and generate useful knowledge to inform policy recommendations related to varietal replacement and seed systems development. © 2020 Jaleta et al.

AB  - The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has and continues to have far-reaching global economic and environmental implications. In developing economies and regions, the pandemic's disruption of the agriculture commodity supply chain has made it difficult for smallholder farmers to exist. Smallholder farmer's traditional struggles have worsened. However, technology may provide promise of improving conditions for vulnerable farmers even in a period of crises such as the COVID-19 period. In this article, we draw on lessons learned in developed and developing countries to propose critical digital transformation for building a resilient and sustainable post-COVID-19 supply chains for developing countries, especially for smallholder farmers operating in global value chains. We discuss how digital technologies and specifically digital inclusion of smallholder farmers can prevent major disruptions from damaging the livelihoods of society's most vulnerable. We discuss feasibility and provide some caveats for a post-COVID-19 digital inclusion in developing countries. © 1973-2011 IEEE.

AB  - The Chinese government applies the term ‘tree crops’ (jingjilin) to a bundle of tree species with uses other than timber production, defining this category as a component of national forest statistics. Tree crops may displace either farmland or forestland, and can be a promising livelihood option for smallholders. The overall impact of this particular policy on natural forest growth remained unanswered. In the general expansion trend of tree cover in southern China, tree crops could compete for land with natural forests, their cultivation may pose environmental trade-offs with natural forest cover. However, in a context of large labor flows from countryside to cities, tree crops could provide promising opportunities for dealing with on-farm labor shortages and generating income for disadvantaged populations remaining in rural communities, then promoting remaining natural forest quality through alternative livelihoods process. There is a knowledge gap to thoroughly investigate tree crops’ impact on natural forest change both conceptually and empirically, especially a mechanism verification of the alternative livelihood hypothesis. Thus, we construct a framework assessing land use competition and alternative livelihood effects together to assess overall impacts of tree crop cultivation on natural forests. Our dataset combines forest resource inventory data and provincial social-economic factors for a panel analysis of contributions to change in natural forest cover, density, and stock in China's biodiversity-rich southern provinces. Results show tree crop cover is negatively associated with natural forest extent, but positive associated with change in natural forest density, while the relationship with change in natural forest stock is insignificant. Further tests of mechanisms support the hypothesis that tree crops benefit disadvantaged rural populations, providing an alternative livelihood. Defining tree crops as forest in China obscures important patterns, particularly a trade-off between tree crops and natural forest cover and a possible synergy with natural forest density mediated by alternative livelihood processes. Policy makers should enact specific policies to incentivize natural forest recovery in the southern collective forest zone and reconsider the appropriateness of defining tree crops as forest. Concentration and intensification of tree crop production on suitable lands may have the potential to benefit both forests and impoverished populations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate borrowing motivation, credit access barriers and their impacts on income of smallholder farmers engaging in cinnamon value chain development in Northwestern Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach: A multistage sampling technique using a structural questionnaire and in-depth interviews was applied for collecting primary data from farmers and relevant stakeholders. The Propensity Score Matching was employed to analyze access barriers and examine whether relaxing these barriers can improve farmer income. To deal with the issue of model uncertainty and further increase the robustness of results, Bayesian model average and the bootstrapping approach were applied. Findings: To fulfill the certain quality standards of cinnamon products which are later used in the medicinal and food industry, farmers as primary producers need credit for intensive investment to increase the value of their products. Still, there are 25.36 percent of farmers who have access constraints to formal credit. In the credit received group, 24.56 percent have not received full credit as demanded. Access problems are relevant to lack of collateral, lack of bank account holdings, inconvenient access to roads, weak chain linkage and limited organic farming. Removing credit access barriers can improve the income for farmers from cinnamon farming activities. Research limitations/implications: More detailed information on the conditions under which credit serves a more important role in creating value addition for cinnamon products can help the government establish more effective credit policies. Social implications: Great attention should be paid to smallholder farmers as primary producers in the chain for sustainable value chain development in developing and emerging economies. Policy interventions should facilitate access to bank accounts, speed up the process of granting residential land use certificates, certify organic farming and upgrade the road system. Strengthening the chain linkage can enhance smallholder farmers’ capacity to obtain credit through value chain lending development. Originality/value: Empirical studies on agricultural credit from the perspective of value chain development remain scarce. A better understanding of credit access constraints allows for the positing of recommendations for policy makers to facilitate value chain lending and a medicinal plant-based agro-forestry system in similar situations. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of rice value chain participation and social networks on smallholder farmers' market performance outcomes (paddy price, quantity of paddy traded, and net returns), using data from a recent survey of 458 smallholder rice farmers in northern Ghana. We employed a treatment effects model to account for potential selection bias associated with observable and unobservable factors. The empirical results reveal that smallholder farmers' participation in a rice value chain is associated with increased paddy price, quantity traded, and net returns. We also find that value chain participation decisions and market performance are positively and significantly influenced by social networks. The empirical results also suggest that sex, farm size, mobile phone ownership, and access to credit significantly increase paddy prices, quantity traded, and net returns of smallholder rice farmers in the value chain. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Mozambique is characterized by low agricultural productivity, which is associated with low use of yield-enhancing agricultural inputs. Fertilizer application rate averaged 5.7 kg ha-1 in Mozambique during the period 2006 to 2015, considerably low by regional targets, yet constraints that affect fertilizer use have not been thoroughly investigated. This study examined the constraints on fertilizer value chains in Mozambique to contribute to fertilizer supply chain strengthening. We used a combination of multivariate analysis and descriptive methods. Our findings indicate that fertilizer use has both demand and supply constraints. Key demand-side constraints include liquidity challenges, limited awareness about the benefits of using fertilizer, and low market participation, while the main supply-side constraints include high transaction costs, limited access to finance, and lack of soil testing results and corresponding fertilizer recommendations by soil type and crop uptake. These results suggest that scaling up the input subsidy program through vouchers (either paper-based vouchers or e-vouchers) with demonstration plots and effective targeting could drive up smallholders' demand for fertilizer and fertilizer supply by strengthening a sustainable network of wholesalers and retailers. This would likely boost agricultural productivity. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Global trade in niche commodities has increased the influence of consumers' choices on land use change and livelihoods in developing rural areas. New niche commodity markets for fine cocoa—produced by old tree varieties frequently grown in shaded agroforestry systems—create more direct linkages between producers and buyers. We explored the socioeconomic and environmental outcomes for cocoa smallholders that participated in direct trade relations compared with smallholders that sold through mainstream markets. Household interviews were conducted with cocoa smallholders in northern Ecuador. Biodiversity conditions at farm level were monitored for 75% of surveyed households. Using a counterfactual based on genetic matching, we found that smallholders engaged in direct trade (a) captured superior prices for cocoa sales; (b) had greater access to agricultural training, technical assistance, and improved social networks; and (b) applied more nature-friendly management practices, compared with smallholders selling through mainstream markets. However, a strong overlap between direct trading practices and organic certification made attribution of environmental benefits difficult. This overlap likely explained why farmers engaged in direct trade used more organic fertilizers and less herbicide. Shade level and plant species richness and abundance in plantations were unrelated to market participation. Additional qualitative analyses suggest that certification facilitates engagement in direct trade and that some direct buyers request certification. This study provides insights on the potential of developing value chain innovations for high-quality commodity trade. The success of value chain innovations hinges on the competitiveness of farmers' cooperatives and involvement of governments, nongovernmental organizations, and private actors. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

AB  - Producer organizations (POs) provide benefits to smallholders by alleviating market access challenges. However, whether all farmers benefit from a PO is still a question. Limited evidence is available on whether POs are inclusive of poor farmers. Even if the poor join, do they participate in decision-making? We conducted interviews with 595 smallholder dairy farmers in Kenya. We distinguish three groups; members of a bargaining PO, members of a processing PO and non-members. We show that membership is related to the structural characteristics of the organization: processing POs favor membership of farmers that are wealthier, more educated and more innovative. As to participation in the decision-making process: older, male and specialized farmers have a higher chance of being involved than poor farmers. Factors distinguishing farmer participation in decision-making between bargaining and processing POs are highlighted. We find that a bargaining PO is more inclusive of all groups of farmers, while women and poor farmers are excluded from decision-making in a processing PO. Our findings contribute to policymaking on inclusive development. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Valorising the biocultural heritage of common goods could enable peasant farmers to achieve socially and economically inclusive sustainability. Increasingly appreciated by consumers, peasant heritage products offer small farmers promising opportunities for economic, social and territorial development. Identifying the obstacles and levers of this complex, multi-scale and multi-stakeholder objective requires an integrative framework. We applied the panarchy conceptual framework to two cases of participatory research with small quinoa producers: a local fair in Chile and quinoa export production in Bolivia. In both cases, the “commoning” process was crucial both to bring stakeholders together inside their communities and to gain outside recognition for their production and thus achieve social and economic inclusion. Despite the differences in scale, the local fair and the export market shared a similar marketing strategy based on short value chains promoting quality products with high identity value. In these dynamics of biocultural heritage valorisation, the panarchical approach revealed the central place as well as the vulnerability of the community territory. As a place of both anchoring and opening, the community territory is the privileged space where autonomous and consensual control over the governance of common biocultural resources can be exercised. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Agroforestry is recognized as a sustainable land use practice. However, the uptake of such a promising land use practice is slow. Through this research, carried out in a Terai district of Nepal, we thoroughly examine what influences farmers' choice of agroforestry adoption and what discourages the adoption. For this, a total of 288 households were surveyed using a structured questionnaire. Two agroforestry practices were compared with conventional agriculture with the help of the Multinomial Logistic Regression (MNL) model. The likelihood of adoption was found to be influenced by gender: the male-headed households were more likely to adopt the tree-based farming practice. Having a source of off-farm income was positively associated with the adoption decision of farmers. Area of farmland was found as the major constraint to agroforestry adoption for smallholder farmers. Some other variables that affected positively included livestock herd size, provision of extension service, home-to- forest distance, farmers' group membership and awareness of farmers about environmental benefits of agroforestry. Irrigation was another adoption constraint that the study area farmers were faced with. The households with a means of transport and with a larger family (household) size were found to be reluctant regarding agroforestry adoption. A collective farming practice could be a strategy to engage the smallholder farmers in agroforestry. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Integration of smallholders in outgrower schemes has been advanced as a strategy for poverty reduction in the global south, but how terms and conditions of inclusion and exclusion shape divergent outcomes, and processes underpinning these local dynamics remain an under-researched area. This study, set in Zambia's southern ‘sugarbelt’ region of Mazabuka, draws on two contrasting outgrower schemes to examine determinants of smallholder inclusion in sugar value-chains, and consider how various terms and conditions underpining inclusion shape various interests, reactions and pathways for value capture among different local groups. Our study reaveals terms and conditions are important in shaping divergent outcomes for smallholders included in sugar value-chains. It shows determinants of inclusion and exclusion are complex and go beyond market imperatives that are production related (structural) to include social-cultural dynamics (non-structural). The centrality of the paper points to lived realities and experiences for different groups and political reactions from below, underlining how socially contested intersection of global–local value-chain produces diverse but interdependent hierarchies of inclusion and exclusion. For an early stage in planning of outgrower schemes by state and non-state actors, recognition of the various social groups and their complex engagement and reactions to changes in land-use and land control will not only expose competing interests but should inform polices, institutions and investments to improve value-chain impacts. This paper hopes to contribute towards a more nuanced understanding of the complex engagement of smallholders in changes in land use and land control in developing countries in the era of land-grabbing. © 2020

AB  - On-farm diversification is a promising strategy for farmers to adapt to climate change. However, few recommendations exist on how to diversify farm systems in ways that best fit the agroecological and socioeconomic challenges farmers face. Farmers' ability to adopt diversification strategies is often stymied by their aversion to risk, loss of local knowledge, and limited access to agronomic and market information, this is especially the case for smallholders. We outline seven steps on how practitioners and researchers in agricultural development can work with farmers in decision-making about on-farm diversification of cropping, pasture, and agroforestry systems while taking into account these constraints. These seven steps are relevant for all types of farmers but particularly for smallholders in tropical and subtropical regions. It is these farmers who are usually most vulnerable to climate change and who are, subsequently, often the target of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) interventions. Networks of agricultural innovation provide an enabling environment for on-farm diversification. These networks connect farmers and farmer organizations with local, national, or international private companies, public organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and research institutes. These actors can work with farmers to develop diversified production systems incorporating both high-value crops and traditional food production systems. These diversified farm systems with both food and cash crops act as a safety net in the event of price fluctuations or other disruptions to crop value chains. In this way, farmers can adapt their farm systems to climate change in ways that provide greater food security and improved income. © Copyright © 2020 van Zonneveld, Turmel and Hellin.

AB  - The smallholder tree-farm resources of Southeast Asia are generating substantial benefits for growers and support many successful domestic wood processors. They could provide even greater benefits at all levels of the supply and value chains if they enjoyed a sympathetic policy framework; technical and specialised support and training to promote productivity gains; and greater knowledge of market trends and access requirements. This paper reviews current forest certification systems as applied to smallholder tree-farmers in Southeast Asia, with a focus on the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Thailand and Viet Nam, and questions whether perceived benefits match operational realities. A critical issue in any form of transactional relationship between two or more people or institutions is to answer to mutual satisfaction the question, ‘Who benefits?’ This is particularly important in transactions between relatively weak and vulnerable and relatively strong and powerful individuals and groups, such as the relationships between smallholder tree-farmers in Southeast Asia and purchasers of certified wood products. We explore factors that drive certification and how they intersect with salient characteristics of smallholder tree-farms restricting the adoption of certification. We argue that new approaches are required to deliver the benefits necessary to expand smallholder participation in wood production supply chains, such as national codes of practice for small-scale forestry and agreed standards that encourage mutual recognition between verification systems. Innovative approaches should be adopted to deliver a fair, equitable and inclusive model that is relevant, practical, feasible and cost-effective for smallholder tree-farmers. As currently practised, certification has many positive aspects for some types of forests and wood producers but rarely for smallholder tree-farmers. A new approach to smallholder forest certification is required to ensure that the answer to the question, ‘Who benefits?’ is, ‘All participants in the supply and value chain, including smallholder tree-farmers’. To achieve this outcome, certification organisations and forest products businesses should remove existing barriers to smallholder participation and develop initiatives to more fairly link smallholder tree-farmers with others in the supply chain, based on enabling and mutually supportive partnerships. © 2020, © 2020 Institute of Foresters of Australia (IFA).

AB  - Considering the contraction of land under cotton cultivation in Pakistan due to low economic incentives, the present study is intended to estimate the cost and revenue along with different factors affecting the cotton production in southern Punjab. The primary data from 480 cotton growers was collected by adopting a multistage random sampling technique in person interviews by using a well-designed pretested questionnaire. The cost-benefit ratio was calculated by estimating the total production cost, total revenue, net farm income, and gross margins. The present study applied data envelopment analysis to evaluate the technical, allocative, and cost-efficiency of the cotton farmers. The second stage regression analysis was also conducted to explore the factor affecting cotton production by using the Cobb-Douglas production function. The regression results revealed that farming experience, education, land preparation cost, and irrigation cost has a positive impact on total revenue, whereas, chemicals and fertilizers cost showed a negative effect. According to BCR, medium farmers obtained 1.27 by investing one rupee in cotton production followed by large and small farmers 1.11 and 1.07, respectively. The results suggested that there is a dire need to fill the gap between extension workers and cotton growers. Moreover, the agriculture department should guide and train the farmers about the optimum utilization of inputs to reduce the production cost. © 2020, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

AB  - Rice production is considered an increasing source of income and food security for smallholder farmers in many parts of Tanzania. Improving market access for rice farmers is essential to raise rural incomes and reducing poverty. This study aims to determine the cost-benefit efficiency of different rice marketing channels and factors affecting marketing channel choices of smallholder rice farmers. The analysis has been conducted using various efficiency indicators and Multinomial Logit Model on quantitative data collected from 213 rice farmers in Mbeya, one of the main rice production regions in Tanzania. The results showed that out of the studied channels, the miller-wholesale marketing channel is the most efficient market. Regarding the factors, the results show that although most farmers in rural areas still sell their produce to local collectors, favorable prices and reduced transaction cost due to ownership of transportation and storage facilities, access to market information, credit access, transportation infrastructure improvement, and collective action through associations influences farmers to choose better marketing channels. The findings suggest that policies aimed at improving extension services, access to productive assets, access to formal credit, improvement of rural infrastructure and post-harvest facilities, reducing transaction costs, promoting the use of farmers’ production and marketing groups to access appropriate marketing information could enhance marketing efficiency and inclusion of smallholder farmers in markets. © 2020, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

AB  - Experts expect that climate change will soon have a severe impact on the lives of farmers in the region surrounding Kerala, India. This region, which is known for its monsoon climate (which involves a distinct temporal and spatial variation in rainfall), has experienced a decrease in annual rainfall over the last century. This study is aimed at investigating how smallholder farmers perceive climate change and at identifying the methods that these smallholders use to adapt to climate change. We use data collected from a survey of 215 households to compare the climate vulnerability of three watershed communities in Kerala. We find that the farmers perceive substantial increases in both temperature and the unpredictability of monsoons; this is in accordance with actual observed weather trends. The selection of effective adaptation strategies is one of the key challenges that smallholders face as they seek to reduce their vulnerability. The surveyed households simultaneously use various adaptation methods, including information and communication technology, crop and farm diversification, social networking through cooperatives, and soil and water conservation measures. The results of a binary regression model reveal that the household head's age, education and gender, as well as the farm's size and the household's size, assets, livestock ownership, poverty status and use of extension services, are all significantly correlated with the households' choices regarding adaptations to cope with climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Despite the fact that contracting facilitates farmer participation in agrifood value chains, evidence on farmers’ participation in different forms of contracts and the impact on farm performance is still limited. This study examines the determinants and impacts of vertical coordination mechanism-spot market transactions, written, and verbal contract-on-farm performance of rice farmers in northern Ghana, using a multinomial BFG model to account for selectivity bias. The findings indicate that vertical coordination participation decision is significantly influenced by age, access to credit, labor, association membership, and sales to institutional buyers. The empirical results also reveal significant gains in farm performance outcomes from participating in written and verbal contracts, relative to spot market transactions. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The main purpose of this work was analyzing how an innovation platform can foster and provide a basis for multi-actor collaboration in order to enable climate-smart agriculture (CSA) implementation at the local level. Using a mix of social (interactions between stakeholders, knowledge changes, adoption of practices) and technical indicators (income, fulfillment of caloric requirements of the household, farm resource use, planned biodiversity or greenhouse gas emission changes), we monitored the collaboration between an NGO, local civil authorities, associations, and farmers that aimed to achieve a common goal linked to the participatory and contextualized development of CSA in Colombia. We found that multiple stakeholder engagements led to improved interactions between members of the platform and their local environment, a proactive participation in the platform meetings and a significant increase in farmer knowledge levels on the challenges posed by climate change and the resultant extreme events. The platform also facilitated the adoption of best-bet practices that contribute towards CSA when farmers both diversify their production and decrease the use of mineral fertilizers. Our findings suggest that innovation platforms can facilitate the collective understanding and use of CSA options corresponding to local conditions and priorities. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Climate variability is a key source of livelihood risks faced by smallholder farmers in drier environments in many developing countries. Climate information provided on seasonal time-scales can sometimes improve agricultural decision-making. However, there are many barriers to the effective dissemination, communication and use of such information on farm and across the value chain. We used a case study in southern India to explore ways of overcoming some of these barriers such as those limiting access to information and effective communication of probabilistic forecast information. Firstly, we used social network analysis at the village level to identify particular individuals, groups or/and institutions who are central in information networks so as to be able to support them to increase the efficiency, effectiveness, equity and robustness of information transfers. This allowed us to identify potential opportunities and challenges around access, communication and forecast use. Close linking of formal and informal networks appeared to be a common, positive influencing factor. Secondly, we used value chain analysis to assess how pre-and post-farm decision-makers could use seasonal climate forecasts (SCF) in their own businesses and how this may propagate up and down the value chain. We found that the motivation for using SCF varied across the value chain and was likely of limited use to smaller, off-farm value chain players who take a short-term adaptive management approach to planning. However, it was seen as having significant potential for larger businesses who take a more strategic approach. This identified a possible risk of increased competitive inequality between businesses of different sizes. Thirdly, we addressed the challenge of translating probabilistic climate forecast information into support for decision making by using decision analysis with intermediaries enabling them to structure clearly problems with embedded climate probabilities. The construction of decision-trees enabled farm advisers and local researchers to explore the potential value of SCF by using the decision trees as a “boundary object” around which farmers and other decision makers, agricultural scientists, climate scientists, economists, social scientists and policy-makers could have thoughtful discussion leading to useful strategies to better manage climate risk. This paper outlines approaches and outcomes associated with these three activities as a way of exploring effective application of seasonal climate information and identifies additional research to enhance applicability. © 2018

AB  - Although many studies analyzed effects of sustainability standards—such as Fairtrade or Rainforest Alliance—on smallholder farmers in developing countries, most did not sufficiently account for systematic differences between certified and noncertified farmers. Certified farmers are typically organized in cooperatives. When sampling only from a small number of cooperatives, as previous studies did, it is not easy to disentangle certification effects from possible cooperative effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by randomly sampling from a large number of cooperatives, thus better capturing existing institutional heterogeneity. In particular, we collect and use data from cocoa farmers in Côte d'Ivoire who are organized in Fairtrade-certified and noncertified cooperatives. Regression models with instrumental variables show that Fairtrade has positive and significant effects on cocoa yields, prices, and living standards. These effects remain significant also after controlling for cooperative characteristics, but the magnitude of the estimates changes. We draw two conclusions. First, in Côte d'Ivoire, Fairtrade certification benefits farmers economically. Second, and more generally, cooperative characteristics are jointly correlated with certification and relevant outcomes, which needs to be accounted for to avoid bias when evaluating the benefits of sustainability standards in the small farm sector. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - A common and driving assumption in agricultural research is that the introduction of research trials, new practices and innovative technologies will result in technology adoption, and will subsequently generate benefits for farmers and other stakeholders. In Lao PDR, the potential benefits of introduced technologies have not been fully realised by beneficiaries. We report on an analysis of a survey of 735 smallholder farmers in Southern Lao PDR who were questioned about factors that influenced their decisions to adopt new technologies. In this study, we have constructed measures or states of adoption which identify key elements of an adoption decision-making nexus. Analysis was conducted to statistically group explanatory factors of adoption. The key explanatory factors represented attributes of the farmer, the factors considered when undertaking production decisions and elements of the agricultural value chain that present as opportunities or constraints. We describe the combination of farmer’s personal attributes, perceptions of the value chain, and the introduction of new technologies by external actors as an “agricultural research value chain”, where agricultural research activities intervene to derive greater benefits for local farmers. A generalised linear model, via Poisson (multiple) regression analysis on the identified explanatory factors, was applied to explore how they influence adoption measures and we found several significant relationships. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Purpose: Paddy farmers form the backbone of food security. However, poverty plagues them despite having linked them to the rice value chain. To overcome this, the concept of involving smallholders in post-farm value chain stages is promoted. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of upgrading smallholder involvement in rice value chains through the adoption of a sustainability standard. Design/methodology/approach: The authors built a system dynamic model to capture both conventional and certified sub-value chains. The latter deviates from the conventional one and capitalizes on compliance to a sustainability standard. Findings: When compared to conventional farm gate sales methods, the simulations revealed obvious profitability of direct marketing with respect to certified sustainable rice. Although coupled with productivity growth, the simulations indicated the shift to standard adoption would likely to be both limited and slow. Originality/value: The findings suggest that the profitability of a certified rice value chain will remain fettered. In order to enhance both farmer livelihood and food security, given the limited prospect of moving smallholders up that chain, the authors conclude that national policy should be rationalized and concentrated on the possibility of diversifying the end-use of rice through research, development and subsequent commercialization. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The concept of resilience gained traction in academic, policy, and development discourse in recent years, yet its conceptualization and application at the farm level has received little attention. For instance, recent policy recommendations present farm resilience as a silver bullet in dealing with agricultural risks and uncertainty, and in achieving sustainable agri-food systems. Yet, the question of what determines farm resilience in a smallholder farming set-up remains fuzzy. To address this knowledge gap, we firstly develop a novel conceptual framework based on determinants of farm resilience and farmer adaptive capacity as a pathway through which farm resilience is strengthened. The emphasis on adaptive capacity responds to a conceptual weakness inherent in studies that present socio-ecological systems as static systems. Secondly, based on a literature review, we propose mechanisms through which farmer entrepreneurship, membership in farmer organization, and farmer-buyer relationships may influence farmer adaptive capacity and thereby farm resilience. Based on our conceptual understanding of the determinants of farm resilience, we recommend approaches that augment farmer entrepreneurship, support farmer organizations, and strengthen farmer-buyer relationships. © 2020 by the author.

AB  - The implementation of new agricultural technologies has become a driving force for cleaner production on smallholder farms. Particularly, identifying technologies could enhance the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production, both of which are serious challenges. In this context, evaluating the adoption of certified seed and its impact on efficiency gains and waste reduction is highly fundamental for sustainable smallholder food production. This perspective was not always considered in previous studies. We address this research gap using cross-sectional data from wheat farmers in northern Kazakhstan. A multi-stage sampling procedure is employed while the sample-selection stochastic production frontier (SPF) is applied for a robust estimation. Results reveal that increased crop income, access to credit and education positively influence the adoption of certified seed while membership in cooperatives and distance from the market are negative determinants. We also find that adopters are 10.3% "cleaner in production" than non-adopters. A comparison was made between the conventional SPF and the sample-selection SPF to evaluate the credibility of the estimation. It was found that the estimates from the conventional SPF were biased by 10%. This study provides insights into two policy and scholarly questions, namely, how effective the adoption of certified seeds is in promoting cleaner production among wheat farmers and how it can be promoted among wheat farmers. Therefore, our study presents substantial empirical evidence to encourage investment in or to promote certified seed adoption in wheat production. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Investigated in this work is the impact of contract farming participation on smallholder farmers' income and food security in rice crop production in Northern Benin using 400 randomly selected rice farmer households. Unlike previous studies, we corrected for both observed and unobserved biases by combining propensity score matching (PSM) and the local average treatment effect parameter (LATE). The results showed significant negative consequences of partaking in rice contract farming. We found evidence of significant negative effects on rice production income at a 1% level. The more the rice farmers join in contract farming, the lower the farm income became. Decreased food consumption was also a result of contract farming participation for potential participants by a score of 60.64, placing their households at the food security status level of poor food consumption because the quantity and nutritional quality of the food consumed were inadequate. Contract farming is, therefore, not a reasonable policy instrument that can help farmers increase their income and improve their food security level in the Alibori Department, Benin if farmers do not diversify their crops. The necessary resources and economic environment are not yet in place to allow contract farming to take full advantage of its potential benefits. To prevent the wasting of scarce public resources, expanding contract farming would not be appropriate in marginal areas with markets and other infrastructure. Additional measures are needed for contract farming to be profitable for contracting actors and to ensure sustainability and the large-scale participation of farmers. © 2020 by the author.

AB  - The increasing population pressure in the rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa has caused land degradation as well as an increase in the number of landless farmers. To promote a conservation-oriented utilization of communal lands and increase the livelihood of poor farmers, the Ethiopian government introduced a program to distribute less-utilized communal lands to landless farmers. This study identified the social norms related to natural resource conservation that affect the participation in this program. Using data from 477 farmer households in northern Ethiopia, we estimated probit models with endogenous regressors for the determinants of social norms and their impacts on program participation. The results show that social norms related to conservation positively affect program participation. Regarding policy implication of the findings, an intervention to improve the social norms of local farmers leads to sustainable resource conservation without reducing intrinsic motivation of the local people. A conservation-oriented utilization of the communal lands would be more effective if the land distribution program was accompanied by other programs to improve the social norms in the villages. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Globally, 38% of the land area is agricultural land, of which 45% are located on drylands, mainly in Africa and Asia, constituting the basis for about 60% of the world's food production. Of all farms worldwide, 83% are smallholder farm systems, whose livelihoods depend on effective land management and allocation. While land is often cultivated by the various members of a farm household, land allocation decisions depend on the approval, the ambition and the abilities of influential household members, likely affecting all other household members, too. While intra-household decision-making processes have been described to depend on the interplay of prevailing interests and power positions, so far knowledge on interests and power positions is based on individual reports rather than actual observations. With the aim to explore the process of land allocation in a socially complex smallholder farm system, we invited members of a smallholder community in Northern Ghana to join a closed, experimental serious game, simulating a negotiation process between a male household head (HHH), a wife and the eldest son of a hypothetical local farm household. We observed an integrative negotiation style, resulting into high levels of satisfaction with the negotiation process and outcome by all parties, who reported a high level of similarity between simulated and real-life negotiations. Power was observed to be actively deployed, withheld or passively overruled depending on decision domains and process dynamics. While the HHH was the key decision maker acting as a strategic gatekeeper in a funnel-like process, the wife and the son had a significant influence on ‘his decision’ i.e. the household-level negotiation outcome. Model-based analysis also showed that the household-level outcome was more profitable as well as agro-biologically and nutritionally more diverse and productive as compared to the HHHs’ suggestion. The proposed game proved to be a culturally adequate, simple, cost and time effective tool to capture how household-level land use decisions may come about and whose interests they represent. Our study provides a powerful framework for further research and for policies to foster more equitable land use decisions and therewith more sustainable socio-ecological systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the greatest challenges humanity faces is feeding the world's human population in a sustainable, nutritious, equitable and ethical way under a changing climate. Urgent transformations are needed that allow farmers to adapt and develop while also being climate resilient and contributing minimal emissions. This paper identifies several illustrative adaptation and development pathways, recognising the variety of starting points of different types of farmers and the ways their activities intersect with global trends, such as population growth, climate change, rapid urbanisation dietary changes, competing land uses and the emergence of new technologies. The feasibility of some pathways depends on factors such as farm size and land consolidation. For other pathways, particular infrastructure, technology, access to credit and market access or collective action are required. The most viable pathway for some farmers may be to exit agriculture altogether, which itself requires careful management and planning. While technology offers hope and opportunity, as a disruptor, it also risks maladaptations and can create tradeoffs and exacerbate inequalities, especially in the context of an uncertain future. For both the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2015 Paris Agreement to be achieved, a mix of levers that combine policy, technology, education and awareness-raising, dietary shifts and financial/economic mechanisms is required, attending to multiple time dimensions, to assist farmers along different pathways. Vulnerable groups such as women and the youth must not be left behind. Overall, strong good governance is needed at multiple levels, combining top-down and bottom-up processes. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Poverty is prevalent in the small-farm sector of many developing countries. A large literature suggests that contract farming—a preharvest agreement between farmers and buyers—can facilitate smallholder market participation, improve household welfare, and promote rural development. These findings have influenced the development policy debate, but the external validity of the extant evidence is limited. Available studies typically focus on a single contract scheme or on a small geographical area in one country. We generate evidence that is generalizable beyond a particular contract scheme, crop, or country, using nationally representative survey data from 6 countries. We focus on the implications of contract farming for household income and labor demand, finding that contract farmers obtain higher incomes than their counterparts without contracts only in some countries. Contract farmers in most countries exhibit increased demand for hired labor, which suggests that contract farming stimulates employment, yet we do not find evidence of spillover effects at the community level. Our results challenge the notion that contract farming unambiguously improves welfare. We discuss why our results may diverge from previous findings and propose research designs that yield greater internal and external validity. Implications for policy and research are relevant beyond contract farming. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coffee farmers are already experiencing the impacts of climate change, yet recommended resilience strategies are often cost-prohibitive for smallholder producers and/or maladapted to local conditions and contexts. We collaborated with smallholder coffee cooperatives in Latin America to assess the feasibility of climate change resilience strategies they selected: crop diversification; rainwater collection systems; pest monitoring and management; collective coffee seed banks and nurseries; and solar coffee dryers. Data was collected through key actor and cooperative leader semi-structured interviews and focus groups with cooperative members. Our results provide criteria that can be used to determine if these five resilience strategies are appropriate for given environmental, socioeconomic, and political contexts. They also demonstrate the need for tailoring resilience strategies to fit local conditions. The framework we applied serves to select appropriate, effective and equitable resilience strategies, combining a participatory action research approach to incorporate local knowledge, capital assets analysis for a holistic and realistic understanding of feasibility, and access analysis for an assessment of who will benefit and who will not. This framework can be applied to assess the feasibility of climate change resilience strategies with smallholders in a wide variety of geographies, contexts and agroecosystems. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study examined factors that influence farmers’ participation in malt barley contract farming and West Arsi zones of Oromia region, Ethiopia. Data were collected from 384 (190 contract and 194 non-contract) randomly selected farm households. The probit model showed that age, livestock ownership, credit access, distance to the main market and cooperative membership had positive and significant effects on decision regarding contract farming participation. Propensity score matching technique was used to estimate the impact of participation in contract farming on farm households’ income. And it revealed that contract farming resulted in an increased annual gross farm income of Birr 24,302.20 for contract, which is 27.80% higher than the gross annual income of non-contract malt barley farm households. The finding of this study highlights that contract farming is viable to increase farm household’s income, which policy makers and other concerned agencies may consider as an alternative rural development approach so long as it is tailored to contexts alike. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The value chain extension strategy of Sasakawa Africa Association focuses on improving the capacity of national agricultural extension systems and follows various thematic areas along the value chain to address key challenges accountable for low income households and poverty in Africa. Farmer learning platform is a model designed to increase crop productivity and encompasses demonstration plots where technological packages demonstrated significantly outperformed other technology plots in crop productivity and average profit margins. Enterprise-oriented production, postharvest and trading centers are value adding models designed to improve the effectiveness of extension and adoption of postharvest and agricultural processing technologies by producers. The use of the above along with necessary capacity building has facilitated the development of profitable business linkages of smallholder farmers with financial institutions and reliable market opportunities. The community association trader-trainer model is a market-oriented business approach applied in combination with other extension models. In 2018, 297 community-based commodity association trader-trainers were mobilized and capacitated to improve farmer group dynamics and developed collective input and output access and cluster aggregation centers at community level where various agricultural produces were mobilized and collectively aggregated, and valued at about 3.9 million USD. The supervised enterprise project model is an innovative agricultural extension model developed along with above models for capacity development of extension agents and transfer of technologies to smallholder farmers. Over 6000 supervised enterprise projects have been introduced into 27 universities in 12 African countries for training front-line extension officers and extension delivery to farming communities. © 2020.

AB  - This article examines the nature of contractual relations between sugar outgrowers (contract farmers) and Tongaat Hulett Zimbabwe (THZ). Drawing from a research study conducted at Hippo Valley Estate, using a mixed-methods approach, findings reveal asymmetrical power relations in favour of THZ as reflected by its domination in price determination, monopsony control and risk sharing. Despite radicalisation and attempts by the state to curb the powers of international finance, the article argues that monopoly capital continues to wield significant control in Zimbabwe, leading to growing farmer indebtedness. Thus, the state–capital alliance presents a stumbling block for accumulation by sugar outgrowers. © 2020 ROAPE Publications Ltd.

AB  - Food systems face pressures related to global environmental change and agricultural intensification that make access to productive resources difficult for many actors. Social self-organization is one of the measures taken by actors to enable them to increase their capacity to mitigate challenges and increase their influence as well as build resilience against risks. The objectives of this study were to assess the level of social self-organization in food systems, to identify forms of social self-organization and the motivations behind them, and to analyze the benefits to food systems social-ecological resilience. We collected data from various actor groups at different levels of food systems using mixed methods. Analysis involved six indicators that were scored on a Likert scale. The study observed that smallholders in Kenya organized in women’s self-help groups, agro-ecological movements, and cooperatives, while in Bolivia the Guaraní indigenous people organized in movements addressing territorial integrity. Social self-organization was found to be important in resilience building at a community level and has potential to contribute to more sustainable food systems. However, more research on the link between social self-organization and policy change across scales would provide additional interesting insights. © Common Ground Research Networks, Mukhovi Stellah, Johanna Jacobi, Aymara Llanque, Stephan Rist, Freddy Delgado, Boniface Kiteme, Chinwe Ifejika Speranza Some Rights Reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of transactional costs on smallholder avocado farmers’ participation in the export market and the extent of participation in Murang’a County, Kenya. Design/methodology/approach: Data was collected from 384 avocado farmers in Murang’a County, following stratified sampling. The Heckman two-stage model was used for analysis. Findings: Results showed that the cost of information search was an important variable that impedes smallholders’ participation in export marketing while harvesting costs inhibits the extent of participation in export marketing. Research limitations/implications: This study used data at the farm level. Therefore, insights on transaction costs among other marketing agents in the export market value chain would be an issue for future studies. Originality/value: Following the debate on transaction costs and market participation among farmers in Sub-Sahara Africa, this paper models transactional costs and export market participation among avocado smallholders and measures the extent of participation with the inclusion of harvesting costs, negotiation costs, monitoring costs and information search costs that are not common in previous studies, thus contributing to the development of literature. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - We outline preliminary results of an ongoing research project conducted in collaboration with traditional erva-mate (yerba mate) producers in Southern Paraná and Northern Santa Catarina, Brazil. The multidisciplinary project includes researchers in the natural and social sciences, forest engineers, historians, rural outreach workers, and farmers and is the result of a long-term engagement with smallholder erva-mate producers. Previous research on forest conservation and use in the region had highlighted the important role smallholder farmers play in maintaining forest cover, but knowledge about how farmers and their families perceive traditional erva-mate production systems and understand their environment were needed. Taking a participatory action research approach, our goal is to work with communities to cocreate and share knowledge, ensuring that the research is based on collectively defined goals. Herein, we focus on some of the major themes identified through oral history interviews, particularly in terms of tensions between smallholder farmers and legal frameworks, as well as insecurity in terms of the continuation of traditional, agroecological practices and their importance for the forest. The project aims to engage a range of stakeholders and actors and incorporate a variety of perspectives in understanding forest conservation through use in agroforestry and agroecological systems, particularly in terms of erva-mate production. © 2020 by the author(s).

AB  - Rice production in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam (MRD) is endangered by sea-level rise and an associated increase in the incidence of salinity intrusion. This paper examines the diffusion of salt tolerant rice varieties in the MRD that were promoted through Consortium for Unfavorable Rice Environments (CURE) activities. Factors associated with adoption of CURE-related varieties are estimated using a random utilty model and a dataset of 800 farm households with rice fields in salinity prone areas of the MRD. Results suggest that there has been widespread adoption of CURE-related varieties in salinity-prone areas. Further, multivariate analysis reveals that environment and location characteristics, rather than household characteristics, are the most important determinants of adoption. In particular, CURE-related varieties are more likely to be adopted in high-salinity-risk areas that are not protected by salinity barrier gates. Neighbhors’ adoption decisions also strongly influence household decisions to adopt CURE-related varieties. The contracting of mechanization, particularly for land preparation and harvest, requires the coordination of village households in timing of planting, harvest and varietal duration. This coordination appears to extend to choice of CURE-related varieties. Finally, CURE-related varieties and other varieties generate similar net revenues in a year with low salinity exposure, suggesting that CURE-related varieties are a low-cost insurance policy against salinity inundation in high risk areas. Combined, these results highlight the need to address complex factors beyond current economic profits, like environment, community choices, and risk mitigation, when designing technologies and policies that support farmer adaptation to climatic change. © 2020 Paik et al.

AB  - The purpose of this research is twofold. First, analyzing smallholder famers' selection of high value marketing channels to boost self-sufficiency in the Pakistani Citrus industry, and second, to identify the issues of greater importance pertaining to famers' selection of high value market channels in the Pakistani citrus industry. The study employed survey technique to collect data from 300 citrus farmers in Punjab, and multinomial treatments effects were used to analyze the data. The results indicated though participation in traditional marketing channels (with intermediaries) is still profitable, high value marketing channels appeared more attractive alternative, having been shown to offer increased net income to smallholder citrus growers. Findings showed the importance of production experience and know-how of quality issues are the significant determinants of farmers' reliance on high value marketing channels. To this end, policy makers need to give due consideration to certain exogenous factors such as price expectation, delay of payment, trust in buyer, price fluctuation, and provision of farm services. © ResearchersLinks Ltd.

AB  - This paper reports results of a quasi-experimental study designed to assess the impact of an information and communication technology (ICT) –enabled ecosystem, led by the social enterprise eKutir, on household fruit and vegetable consumption in Odisha, India. eKutir aims at providing self-sustaining solutions to poverty and undernutrition in developing countries by leveraging ICTs through ecosystem development anchored into a distributed micro-entrepreneurial strategy. eKutir's farming micro-entrepreneurs (FME) provide agricultural knowledge, inputs, and market linkages at household and community level, followed by progressive integration of other micro-entrepreneurs at different points along the value chain on both supply and demand sides. The present case examined core FMEs along with retail micro-entrepreneurs (RMEs) deployed in low-resource rural and urban communities. Structural equation modeling was used to compare rural outcomes and the role of homegrown consumption as a mediator. Multivariable linear regression and ANOVA were used to test group differences in the urban sample. Positive β coefficients represent an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption in communities exposed to the eKutir ecosystem in contrast to the comparison group. Farmers in rural communities exposed to the eKutir ecosystem consumed more overall fruit and vegetables (β = 0.30, p < 0.001) and fruits alone (β = 0.53, p < 0.05) than those farmers in comparison villages unexposed to the eKutir ecosystem. This effect was concentrated in households exposed to both FMEs + RMEs (β = 0.60, p < 0.0001) and was mediated by homegrown consumption. A non-significant directional effect was observed in comparing fruit and vegetable consumption in rural households exposed to RMEs only over comparison communities. Urban consumers, exposed to the eKutir ecosystem through access to RMEs operating in their neighborhood community, did not increase their fruit or vegetable consumption compared to non-intervention communities. The results reveal the potential of reaching nutritional impacts through homegrown consumption and with farm-level support outside of governmental/philanthropic interventions through an ICT-enabled social enterprise. They also underscore, however, the challenges of both changing eating behaviour and intervening along the agri-food value chain. Implication for more effective digital ecosystem design and intersectoral policies are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - New data and new methods have provided many new insights into rural households in the past 50 years. We analyze what we have learned from household models since Boserup and Becker, using this to frame more recent findings about household behavior from three types of studies: observational studies, experimental games, and impact evaluations. More sex-disaggregated data, as well as data that are collected at smaller units, such as agricultural plots, have allowed us to better understand agricultural productivity, risk sharing, and spousal cooperation. However, the focus on bargaining within households has often led us to ignore the cooperation that occurs within households. Many resources are owned and managed jointly by household members and many decisions are made jointly, although not all parties necessarily have equal voice in these decisions. Research demonstrating that households often do not reach efficient outcomes suggests that we still have much to learn about rural household behavior. Understanding both individual roles within households and the levels of cooperation, including joint decision making and ownership of resources, is essential to analysis of households, especially in rural areas where households engage in both production and consumption. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The impacts of land titling on investment incentives among farmers with different land reallocation experiences are studied in this work. Ordered Probit model and 2SLS are employed to estimate the survey data collected from 2704 households in rural countries in China. We find that, generally, land titling can substantially promote investment incentive among farmers. However, the impacts vary among farmers with different land reallocation experiences. Specifically, land titling positively affects farmers without land reallocation experience, but it negatively affects those farmers who experienced big reallocation. Land titling has an investment incentive effect on China's special agricultural land system, where farmers only have contract rights of land. However, big reallocation should be heavily restricted to guarantee the investment incentive effect of land titling. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study analysed farmer's perceptions on climate change, their willingness-to-insure their farms and their recovery from or resilience to climate shocks. This involved 209 farmers that were selected through a multistage sampling procedure in the Northern region of Ghana. The data was analysed using double hurdle and ordered probit regressions. From the result, the study established that most of the farmers were willing-to-insure their farms and were willing-to-pay a positive price for farm insurance. The decision to insure farm was significantly influenced by education, farmer group membership and floods. On the other hand, farmer group membership, remitters, windstorm, climate perception and location in a rich class district, extension access, commercial production, floods, drought and off-farm diversification significantly influenced the premium farmers were willing to pay. It is concluded that most of the farmers recover faster from climate shocks as nearly all the farmers indicated an ability to recover from climate shocks with shorter time periods. Generally, the factors that had significant effect on the recovery period of the farmers were age, education, number of children, access to extension service, contract farming, farmer group membership, farm size, sex, number of household adults, access to credit and farm insurance. Therefore, farm insurance is an important strategy of making farming households recover faster from climate shocks. As such, there is the need to introduce farm insurance policies to crop farmers in the region at an agreed price between farmers and insurance providers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Since the 1990s, Argentinean dairy-processing cooperatives have lost considerable amounts of members and market share. We analyse their current role by investigating the characteristics of farmers who continue delivering to them and price differentials between cooperatives and investor-oriented firms (IOFs). A probit regression model applied to 917 farmers suggests that cooperative farmers are more disadvantaged than farmers delivering to IOFs in terms of education, farm size and productive technology. Moreover, t-tests applied to data representing 70 per cent of national volume indicate that farmers delivering to cooperatives are between 11 per cent and 29 per cent smaller than those delivering to IOFs, depending on province. A hierarchical multilevel regression model applied to 9,720 transactions among farmers and processors shows that, after controlling for quantity and quality, cooperatives pay lower (3.5%) but more stable prices than IOFs. In a context of rapid structural change, we observe a market in which larger farmers deliver to IOFs and smaller farmers deliver to cooperatives and conclude that, at the expense of paying lower prices, cooperatives may act as buyers of last resort for otherwise disadvantaged farmers. © 2019 The Authors Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics © 2019 CIRIEC

AB  - Smallholder farmers are excluded from efficient and effective participation in high-value agro-food market chains due to major competitiveness constraints and several market failures along these chains. The purpose of this study is to contribute to the competitiveness of smallholder farmers in a more coordinated and sustainable way that promote their effective and efficient participation in high-value agro-food market chains. In particular, the study aims at determining the main role of households’ capitals, institutional, and access-related factors in conditioning the decision of smallholder farmers of African indigenous vegetables (AIVs) to access pillars of competitiveness in high-value market chains (HVMCs). For this purpose, a unique household-level data from a total of 1232 rural and peri-urban AIV-producing households were surveyed, and the data obtained were analysed by using a multivariate probit model. The results suggest that about two thirds of smallholder AIV farmers had access to at least one pillar of competitiveness in HVMCs. The model results show the presence of inter-dependency of household level decisions to access multiple pillars of competitiveness in HVMCs. Furthermore, the results also reveal that coping with shocks, coupled with access to information on market prices and warnings of unexpected events, contract farming, certification and modern irrigation technologies are the main conditioning factors to the access of the pillars of competitiveness by smallholder farmers. The promotion and implementation of a well-founded mobile phone-based information access platforms, as well as effective and efficient livelihood strategies that support smallholder farmers to access pillars of competitiveness, is of critical importance towards overcoming the major competitiveness constraints along high-value agro-food chains. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The global demand for cashew nuts continues to increase steadily. However, many African countries face difficulties in marketing and adding value to the product. Using recent survey data of 391 cashew farmers in Ghana, this paper contributes to the growing evidence on the significance of contract farming (CF) in improving the welfare of rural households in developing countries. Specifically, the paper analyzes the factors that influence cashew farmers’ decisions to participate in CF, and the impact of participation on farmers’ performance. We employ a recently developed switching regression model with endogenous explanatory variables and endogenous switching to control for selection bias caused by observable and unobservable factors. The empirical results show that participation in CF significantly increases labor productivity and price margins, as well as cashew yields, and net revenues. A disaggregated analysis of the sample into farm size categories reveals that small-sized cashew farms tend to benefit more through CF, compared to medium- and large-sized farms. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Cooperatives are increasingly advocated as a means to improve incomes, livelihoods and the sustainability of smallholder farmers. This study analyzes the impact of commercial vegetable cooperative membership on smallholder agricultural performance in Cambodia. Institutional heterogeneities are considered across cooperatives and various econometric techniques are used to control for potential selection bias. The impacts of horticulture on agricultural outcomes are also analyzed. The results indicate that membership of commercial vegetable cooperatives has so far had no effect on agricultural incomes or the value or amounts of agricultural inputs. However, results indicate that membership has affected technology choice, access to credit services and information transmission through technological training. Additionally, there is evidence that horticulture, as a component of overall agricultural diversification, can augment farm income. The results suggest that much of the benefit of cooperative membership stems from the cooperative's provision of services, which might not be easily inferred from measures of member incomes. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - This paper analyzes smallholder farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) for the purchase of scale-appropriate farm mechanization in the hill ecologies of Nepal using the case of mini-tiller technology: a small, 5–7 horsepower two-wheel tractor primarily used for agricultural land preparation. Using primary survey data from 628 randomly-selected households, we find that farm size, local wage rates, out-migration, access to credit services, and associations with agricultural cooperatives positively influence the WTP for mini-tillers while the number of draft animals owned negatively influence the WTP for mini-tillers. On average, farmers were willing to pay 31% less than the actual price of a mini-tiller. Results also exhibited a heterogeneous demand in which the lowest quartile farm size households, typically the poorest farm households, were willing to pay 26% less for the mini-tiller than the top quartile of farms. In the context of labor scarcity and rising rural wages, agricultural policy on farm mechanization in Nepal should aim to prioritize small farms through robust service provision models in order to increase the level of farm mechanization in the country. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Mariculture Sci-Tech parks promote modern mariculture and help improve China's mariculture industry. A park consists of a core area and a radiation area. The core area includes a farm, a cooperative, or a company, and the radiation area consists of many small farmers. Stochastic frontier analysis is employed to analyze the performance and its influencing factors of different governance structures in mariculture Sci-Tech parks. Results indicated the following: 1) Core areas show diminishing returns of scale, indicating that the increase in the scale of mariculture production can decrease the output. 2) The average technical efficiency of the core area is 0.4728, with the large family farms having the highest (0.4907), followed by the mariculture companies (0.4777) and the fish farmer cooperatives (0.4499). Several reasons can explain the difference in technical efficiency. First, family farms can better apply the new technology and new varieties to the mariculture production through moderate scale management. Second, companies have a higher operating cost, and the construction of mariculture Sci-Tech park has little effect on companies' performance. Third, cooperatives' advantage is not obvious in the organization management and the repeated construction of the infrastructure decreases utilization. 3) When the radiation area is considered, the input of large family farms has the most significant impact on the performance of the entire Sci-Tech park, with the highest driving efficiency. However, the cooperatives' driving efficiency is very poor, and the company performance is only reflected in the capital investment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper develops a farm household model of heterogeneous Malaysian rice farmers. The model determines the domestic price of milled rice in equilibrium. The model is simulated to analyze the effects of free trade, self-sufficiency achieved through trade policy, and the impact of free trade and self-sufficiency when rice productivity expands. The ex ante results for free trade predict that total rice supply rises as the increase in imports offsets the decrease in domestic production, causing the domestic price of milled rice to fall by 15.8 percent. While this price decrease generates negative income effects for rice farmers, it leads to an expansion of consumption of milled rice by both the farm and urban populations. The results for self-sufficiency through heightened tariffs predict that production for domestic rice farmers increases. However, with fewer imports, total rice supply falls, causing the domestic price of rice to increase by 41.5 percent. Because free trade is politically unfeasible and trade-driven self-sufficiency policies contract total rice consumption, boosting rice production through research and development is an effective way for Malaysia to increase the total supply of rice while limiting its dependence on imports. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The New Rural Development program (NRD) is among the top developmental policies of Vietnam’s government to cope with imperative issues in the rural regions, especially a widening income gap between the urban and rural regions. This paper is the first trial for studying on key social, economic, and natural conditions affecting communes’ adoption of the NRD and factors impacting on rural households’ income based on the NRD’s implementation criteria using a Heckman Selection model to substantiate the NRD’s performance of increasing rural households’ income. The estimation model signifies that the poverty rate has a negative impact on the NRD’s adoption in contrast to geographical aspects, average ages, and cooperative variables. At the outcome estimation, rural infrastructure development and technology transfer exert a strong influence on rural households’ earnings. This implies that promoting investments in infrastructure and technology transfer are crucial for rural development, especially with the income increase purposes. © 2019, © 2019 The Korean Association for Public Administration.

AB  - The introduction of EU mandates for biofuel use in the transport sector initially led to high expectations that African countries would benefit from biofuel exports to the EU. This market opportunity has not been realised, however, due to regulatory requirements for the production of biofuels that act as non-tariff barriers to the acceptance of African biofuels in the EU. This benefits producers of biofuel crops and processors in the EU by providing economic protection. In particular, the EU import regime fails to acknowledge the challenges faced by African (or other) developing countries in satisfying the requirements. Using a computable general equilibrium model for Malawi, we quantify the foregone potential benefits from biofuel production for exports to the EU arising from non-tariff barriers (NTBs) embedded in the sustainability criteria. Our results show that sugarcane-ethanol production under smallholder outgrower regimes would lead to both economic growth outcomes and rural development, whereas jatropha-biodiesel fails to increase rural incomes due to low profitability. While there is widespread agreement on the latter today, our study is the first to explore the failure of jatropha in Malawi in an economy-wide framework. The ethanol results, however, also hold if land clearing is forbidden, thereby preserving biodiversity as stipulated under the sustainability criteria in the EU Renewable Energy Directive. The EU NTBs embedded in the Renewable Energy Directive thus play a much larger role for countries in Sub-Sahara Africa than simply inhibiting investment opportunities and should be refashioned to lower the entry costs for developing countries. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Indemnifying smallholder farmers against crop loss is thought to play an important role in encouraging the adoption of new technologies and facilitating productivity growth, but to be infeasible due to information problems. Consequently there is interest in developing alternative, partial, insurance products. Examples include rainfall insurance and the limited liability inherent in credit contracts. I argue that although these products may reduce information asymmetry, ambiguity averse farmers struggle to assess whether the contracts reduce risk. This problem is most pronounced when the production technology is ambiguous, as is likely the case for new technologies. I formalize this argument and test the theory using data from two RCTs, conducted in Malawi and Kenya. Comparative statics from the theory are consistent with both sets of data, and I argue that income losses from ambiguity aversion may be substantial. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Among the array of structurally and toxicologically diverse mycotoxins, aflatoxins have attracted the most interest of scientific research due to their high toxicity and incidence in foods and feeds. Despite the undeniable progress made in various aspects related to aflatoxins, the ultimate goal consisting of reducing the associated public health risks worldwide is far from being reached due to multiplicity of social, political, economic, geographic, climatic, and development factors. However, a reasonable degree of health protection is attained in industrialized countries owing to their scientific, administrative, and financial capacities allowing them to use high-tech agricultural management systems. Less fortunate situations exist in equatorial and sub-equatorial developing countries mainly practicing traditional agriculture managed by smallholders for subsistence, and where the climate is suitable for mould growth and aflatoxin production. This situation worsens due to climatic change producing conditions increasingly suitable for aflatoxigenic mould growth and toxin production. Accordingly, it is difficult to harmonize the regulatory standards of aflatoxins worldwide, which prevents agri-foods of developing countries from accessing the markets of industrialized countries. To tackle the multi-faceted aflatoxin problem, actions should be taken collectively by the international community involving scientific research, technological and social development, environment protection, awareness promotion, etc. International cooperation should foster technology transfer and exchange of pertinent technical information. This review presents the main historical discoveries leading to our present knowledge on aflatoxins and the challenges that should be addressed presently and in the future at various levels to ensure higher health protection for everybody. In short, it aims to elucidate where we come from and where we should go in terms of aflatoxin research/development. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - With the spread of sustainable thinking, people have come to recognize that profitability is not the only element for the long-term success of businesses. Of equal importance is the issue of the use of natural resources and people's living conditions. Within this realization, consumers' interest in knowing the implications of their consumption is increasing through information on how products and services are produced. This increasingly leads organizations to seek to differentiate their brands through Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS). In this context, the aim of this paper is to present a taxonomy of value chain upgrading types through VSS adoption by farmers. Empirical evidence to test the proposed framework is presented focusing on the adoption of the 4C system by coffee farmers in Brazil. Although all five types of upgrading were identified in the field research, most of the improvements can be characterized as environmental. Furthermore, the results indicated that the adoption of the 4C standards was an upgrading form for farmers to enhance the coffee production process, as well as to control management activities within the production unit. The paper is innovative in integrating and proposing a framework for the value chain by adding value through VSS. It also empirically applies the proposed framework in the context of the Brazilian coffee chain. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper contributes to the debate on peasant differentiation and market integration in the food sovereignty literature by examining the smallholder-oriented oil palm sector in Ghana's eastern region. Against the background of loosening entry barriers in global value chains, and through an analysis of farmers' different positions in palm oil's multiple markets, we witness peasant-like patterning of production and strategic market participation among well-situated non-contract farmers. We propose that such interface settings where commodity relations are present, but do not penetrate fully offer valuable entry points for revisiting the role of global markets in peasant reproduction in the Global South. We consequently argue the need to replace the idealized category of “peasant” with an analytical category that can recognize social differentiation and reproduction through partial engagement with commodity markets. © 2019 The Authors Journal of Agrarian Change Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - In Uganda, the tree seed sector is largely centralized, limiting access by farmers to high quality seedlings due to distant supply locations. This has left suppy of most of the tree germplasm to the informal sector, characterized by road-side tree nurseries and seed dealers who have limited knowledge on seed sourcing and collection and seedling production. Through semi-structured and key informant interviews, a sample survey involving 73 smallholder tree seed collectors, processors and tree nursery operators, this study investigates the role of government, smallholder tree seed collectors, processors and suppliers, nursery operators and the private sector in Uganda’s tree seed and seedling production and supply system. The study also identifies constraints in the seed and seedlings distribution system in Uganda and suggests key policy and institutional reforms. The source of tree germplasm is found to be heavily influenced by ease of access. About 60%) of the germplasm is purchased by individual farmers for their own planting. Low quality seed, limited seed sources and overgrown seedlings remain key deficiencies in the tree seed sector. Potential business opportunities in the tree seed and seedling production and supply value chain are identified, including production and sale of high quality germplasm. These will enhance availability of tree germplasm of high quality to meet the growing need for afforestation and reforestation in Uganda. © 2019, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.

AB  - This study uses data from 1,024 coffee producing households to address two critical questions regarding the role of cooperatives in Rwanda’s coffee sector: Does cooperative membership increase adoption of best practices and coffee productivity? and do cooperatives improve farm household welfare? Using a propensity score matching technique to account for selection bias, we find that cooperatives are a critical institution for building farmer capacity, promoting adoption of improved technologies and inputs, and increasing productivity. We discuss the role that cooperatives can play in increasing farmer welfare and reestablishing the coffee sector as a pillar of growth in the country. © 2019, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Themes of inclusion, empowerment, and participation are recurrent in development discourse and interventions, implying enablement of agency on the part of communities and individuals to inform and influence how policies that affect them are enacted. This article aims to contribute to debates on participation in rural development and environmental conservation, by applying a structure-agency lens to examine experiences of marginal farm households in three distinct systems of resource allocation in Lao PDR’s northern uplands—in other words, three institutional or (in)formal structures. These comprise livelihood development and poverty reduction projects, maize contract farming, and a national protected area. Drawing on qualitative data from focus group discussions and household surveys, the article explores the degree to which farmers may shape their engagement with the different systems, and ways in which agency may be enabled or disabled by this engagement. Our findings show that although some development interventions provide consultative channels for expressing needs, these are often within limited options set from afar. The market-based maize system, while in some ways agency-enabling, also entailed narrow choices and heavy dependence on external actors. The direct regulation of the protected area system meanwhile risked separating policy decisions from existing local knowledge. Our analytical approach moves beyond notions of agency commonly focused on decision-making and/or resistance, and instead revisits the structure-agency dichotomy to build a nuanced understanding of people’s lived experiences of interventions. This allows for fresh perspectives on the everyday enablement or disablement of agency, aiming to support policy that is better grounded in local realities. © Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University.

AB  - A major obstruction in the development of sustainable agriculture is the weakness of the financial and banking sectors in supporting smallholder farming. While farmers need to invest in their farms, they struggle to find credit schemes adapted to their specific needs. This study explores the literature on a range of credit systems applied in different geographical and historical contexts to analyse the underlying drivers of their successes or otherwise. In light of this review, the study investigates a farmers' association, Alfredo Namitete (AN), in Mozambique, offering a range of agroecology credit modalities. It is then assessed as to whether a new business model initiated with seed funding could be self-managed by the association itself and lead to greater autonomy. The AN pilot tested three schemes between 2015 and 2019. Based on the findings, i.e., better production, increased revenue and greater self-determination, the study combines elements for a new business model for small-scale lending. It concludes that to be effective, a credit scheme needs to meet several conditions simultaneously: believe in the genuine will to repay, abolish the lender-borrower distance, ensure a role for women in decision making, add a savings mechanism, combine individual and collective investments and, finally, reserve funds for solidarity and climate issues. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Reliable estimates of price and wood yield as well as the calculation of economic criteria that include uncertainty are necessary to make the decision-making process more robust when analysing a long-term activity such as forestry. Through extreme value theory EVT combined with Bayesian inference it is possible to predict probability densities for inputs used in economic evaluation criteria like wood yield and prices. With it, uncertainties regarding the inputs can be taken into account in the economic analysis, improving the way they are obtained. Therefore, this study aimed to use Bayesian approach and EVT to estimate future price and yield to carry out an economic evaluation of a forestry project. Yield, maximum and minimum price were estimated in the form of probability density. Considering 95% of probability, the NPV calculated for the minimum price situation ranged from R$ 2050.11 to R$ 5409.07 ha−1, with a mean of R$ 3771.60 ha−1. The NPV calculated for the maximum price situation ranged from R$ 7766.77 to R$ 9070.29 ha−1, with a mean of R$ 8398.13 ha−1. These results serve as best and worst-case scenarios for managers in the case of a eucalyptus plantation established in 2017 under an outgrower scheme in Brazil. The presented methodology provided good results when estimating the variables of interest. It incorporates probability levels and/or prior information. With it, the economic performance of the project and its risks are better visualized and understood by researchers and managers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forested landscapes around the world are owned, governed, and managed by many small owners and collectives. The management decisions that these owners and collectives make aggregate into measurable impacts on forest cover, fragmentation, carbon storage, biodiversity, and on the ecosystem services these forests provide to owners and broader society. Conversely, large scale processes such as climate change, globalization of markets, changes to laws regarding land tenure and access, and labor migration and remittances dramatically affect individual forest owners and the activities they are able to do on their land. Using NVivo 11.0, I coded and analyzed 456 papers describing research in the intersection of private or communal owners, forests, and landscape-scale impacts or influences. This analysis identified several prominent themes. Forested landscapes are increasingly split into smaller managed segments among more owners, in some cases facilitating deforestation. Global-scale processes such as labor migration and globalized forest product systems influence management decisions of family forest owners in most countries, particularly the choice of growing exotic species plantations and converting forests to cash crops. Programs and policies aimed at family and communal forest owners can be better targeted to incentivize these owners to protect and enhance forest benefits for broader society, and to better support owners’ adaptations to climate change, invasive species, biodiversity loss, and population demographics. Forest-based tourism and non-timber forest products are important but undervalued incentives for forest conservation. Given the large proportion of forests owned and managed by smallholders, landscape-scale planning and conservation goals cannot be met without engaging these forest owners. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Mental disorders, particularly depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, are common long-term psychological outcomes in emergency contexts arising from conflicts, natural disasters, and other challenging environmental conditions. In emergencies, people suffer not only from the lack of external resources such as drinking water and food but also from poor mental health. Mental disorders can substantially impair daily activities in vulnerable individuals. However, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) behaviors are daily activities that require effort, time, and strong internal motivation. Therefore, questions arise: whether there is a relationship between mental health and safe water behaviors, and if so, whether the motivational drivers of these behaviors are affected by mental health. Methods: Our cross-sectional study conducted face-to-face interviews with 638 households in rural Malawi. We used a quantitative questionnaire based on the risks, attitudes, norms, abilities, and self-regulation (RANAS) approach to measure motivational psychosocial factors. Mental health was assessed using the validated Chichewa version of the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20). Results. Almost a third of the respondents reported poor mental health. We found significant negative association between mental health and self-reported safe water collection (p =.01, r = -.104) but not between safe water transportation and storage behavior. The moderation analysis revealed significant interaction effects of mental health with some psychosocial factors and therefore on WASH behaviors. Poor mental health changed the influence of three psychosocial factors - perceived others' behavior, commitment, and remembering - on safe drinking water collection behavior. The influence on water transportation and storage behavior of the perceived severity of contracting a disease, the belief that transporting and storing water requires substantial effort, and others' approval depended on the mental health condition of the respondent. Conclusions: These results imply that populations with a significant proportion of individuals with poor mental health will benefit from interventions to mitigate mental health before or parallel to behavioral change interventions for WASH. Specific population-level interventions have been shown to have a positive effect on mental well-being, and they have been successfully applied at scale. This research is especially relevant in emergency contexts, as it indicates that mental health measures before any WASH interventions will make them more effective. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - This study attempts to uncover the truth behind an increasing number of smallholder farmers participating in sustainable coffee farming in Vietnam. Using stochastic frontier and cost-benefit analysis, a sample of 316 smallholder farmers in Dak Lak was chosen to analyze the economic impacts of sustainable and conventional coffee farming on farmers’ welfare. In addition, we conducted field observation and key informant interviews to describe several farming practices. The results highlight the fact that farmers’ decisions to participate in sustainable coffee farming are mainly driven by economic benefits. Sustainable farming is more cost-effective and profitable than conventional farming, despite the insignificant difference in production efficiency. Improvement of education, farming knowledge, and collective actions could mitigate negative effects of small-scale production for sustainable coffee farmers. Pesticide management, shade coffee encouragement, and reduction of excessive fertilization, over-irrigation, and unproductive coffee varieties are recommended for sustainable development of the sector. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Globalization of the food market is associated with the possibility of selling products into newer markets. However, it is also associated with the necessity to ensure proper quality products. Quality defined by the ISO 9001:2015 standard consists of factors that are part of customers' expectations concerning the safety of products and the technology of their manufacture. Currently, consumers are looking for products with defined and reproducible sensory properties, in which the content of harmful substances is below the critical values specified by legislation. This is observable particularly in developed countries. The second quality factor is the use of a production technology where negative environmental impacts are reduced. Recently, issues associated with protecting workers' rights and social needs have also become very important. In successive versions of quality management systems, such as GLOBAL G.A.P. or SAI Platform, social issues are becoming more and more important. The aim of this study was to assess the role of risk analysis for social practices in small farms in building a quality management system. Surveys were conducted in 2018. The surveys covered 62 vegetables or fruit farms with a cultivated area of up to 20 ha. Their lack of staff was due to the character of production. Where mechanic production is possible in small farms, family members can secure workforce demand. To achieve the research objective, a risk analysis was carried out for the implementation of social practices according to the guidelines of the ISO 31000:2018 standard. The criteria and inventory of identified risks were carried out, based on the guidelines of GLOBAL G.A.P. Risk Assessments on Social Practice (GRASP). Based on the identified risks, the areas relating to social practices, which require improvement in order to satisfy compliance with the GLOBAL G.A.P. standard, were indicated. The results of the conducted research pointed to a high risk of good social practices not being carried out and not meeting compliance with the requirements of the GLOBAL G.A.P. standard. The most important identified problems are associated with the deficiency of competent workers as well as the lack of facilities where workers can rest, eat and drink. A considerable problem is the conformity of employment contracts with local legislation and ensuring that work time and rest time are consistent with the law. In conditions of small farms in Poland, the problem with ensuring compliance with the standard in question is often the small number of workers. Creating an organized quality management system in the area of social practices is difficult in these cases, and sometimes even impossible. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Double blind field experiments and experimental auctions were conducted with bean and cowpea farmers in Tanzania and Ghana to gauge the relative demand for three types of seed products that differ in price and quality: certified, quality declared, and recycled. Whether the cost differential makes these seeds qualitatively different products as reflected in their perceived performance, and whether that translates into farmers’ willingness to pay price premiums, are the research questions addressed by this study. Results indicate that, all else equal, there were significant differences in the perceived quality of the seed products evaluated. Farmers were willing to pay significantly more for their higher rated seed relative to their lower rated seeds. However, for a majority of farmers the magnitude of the premium they are willing to pay for a higher quality seed is less than the current price differential between certified seed and grain. Research and policy implications of these results for legume seed system are discussed. © 2019 International Association of Agricultural Economists

AB  - Over the course of just a few years, shrimp farming has become a major aquaculture production system in coastal areas of several developing countries across the globe. However, farmers are facing a variety of risks related to disease, market, and climate, which influence risk management strategies and adoption of new technologies. This paper looks at three practices related to pond management: (1) water quality management to ensure a good environment for shrimp growth; (2) adequate feed input; and (3) disease control practices in order to mitigate the risk of disease outbreak in the pond. We investigated adoption of these three practices in smallholder shrimp farms in the Mekong Delta, by exploring how and whether membership into a producer's cluster influences access to knowledge and perception of risk in the adoption process. The results show that, after controlling for farm characteristics, farm clustering has a positive relationship with the adoption of water quality management, feed inputs, and disease control practices. Results also indicate that increasing interaction frequency with public sector and private sector's actors, as well as the perceived degree of market risk, positively influences the adoption of the three pond management practices under study. Mediation analyses show that being a member of a farmer cluster influences adoption of farming practices via two underlying processes: frequency of interaction with public and private sector's actors, and perception of market risk, both of which ultimately promote the adoption of practices. We conclude that clustering is a promising avenue for fostering interactions between farmers and key supporting actors in aquaculture, and impacts both the formation of specific aqua-related risk perceptions and subsequent practice adoption. As such, clusters – by fostering linkages and facilitating interactions between different knowledge sources – can promote adoption of practices toward sustainable intensification. However, to more effectively deploy a cluster approach a key policy and practice implication is to take into consideration local idiosyncrasies defined by their social interactions, risk perception and spatial dimensions in order to better facilitate local linkages between farms (horizontal coordination) and a better integration with the value chain (vertical coordination). © 2019 The Authors

AB  - One of the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 2 is to double agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers through, among other things, improving access to financial services including credit. However, designing appropriate mechanisms for increasing access to credit by poor households remains a challenge, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper argues that technology adoption and collective action could provide pathways to enhancing access to credit. Evidence from milk-producing households in Tanzania suggests that group membership increases the probability of borrowing and the amount of funds borrowed by households, while adoption of artificial insemination increases the amount of funds borrowed. Two major conclusions are that public policy for increasing rural households’ access to credit should promote collective action, and that the likely increase in amount of funds demanded by households due to technology adoption and collective action will require policy to address issues pertaining to credit rationing of rural households. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on farmers’ decisions to adopt integrated pest management (IPM) technology and to estimate the impact of IPM adoption on farm economic performance. Design/methodology/approach: An endogenous switching probit model that addresses the sample selection bias issue arising from both observed and unobserved factors is used to estimate the survey data from a sample of 481 apple households in China. A treatment effects model is employed to estimate the impact of IPM adoption on apple yields, net returns and agricultural income. In order to address the potential endogeneity associated with off-farm work variable in estimating both cooperative membership choice specification and IPM adoption specifications, a control function approach is used. Findings: The empirical results show that cooperative membership exerts a positive and significant impact on the adoption of IPM technology. In particular, farmers’ IPM adoption decision is significantly associated with household and farm-level characteristics (e.g. education, farm size and price knowledge). IPM adoption has a positive and statistically significant impact on apple yields, net returns and agricultural income. Practical implications: The findings indicate that agricultural cooperatives can be a transmission route in the efforts to proliferate the adoption and diffusion of IPM technology, and increased IPM adoption tends to improve the economic performance of farm households. Originality/value: Despite the widespread evidence of health and environmental benefits associated with IPM technology, the adoption rate of this technology remains significantly low. This paper provides a first attempt by investigating to what extent and how agricultural cooperative membership affects IPM adoption and how IPM adoption influences farm economic performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Using a logistic model, this paper empirically investigated farmers' perception of climate change and its determinants based on a field survey of 1 350 rural households across five major grain producing provinces in China. The results show: i) There is an apparent difference in perception levels for long-term temperature and precipitation changes. Specifically, 57.4% of farmers perceived the long-term temperature change correctly, but only 29.7% of farmers perceived the long-term precipitation change correctly; ii) The factors influencing the farmers' perceptions are almost completely different between precipitation and temperature, the former are mostly agriculture related, while latter are mostly non-agriculture related, except for farm size; and iii) Farmers are not expected to pay more attention to long-term precipitation changes over the crop growing seasons, because less than 30% of farmers can correctly perceive long-term precipitation change. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of farmers' perceptions of climate change, the government is recommended to: i) enhance education and training programs; ii) speed up land transfer and expand household land farm size; iii) develop farmer cooperative organizations; iv) invest more in agricultural infrastructure, specifically in major grain producing regions; and v) improve the agricultural environment and increase farming income. © 2019 CAAS.

AB  - Global livestock husbandry provides ecosystem goods and services but also emits 7.1 Gt CO 2 -eq. of greenhouse gases (GHGs) per year. To lower GHG emissions intensity, appropriate production management systems should be identified. Since the 1980s, grassland livestock husbandry in China has transformed gradually from pastoralism into individual household management under the Grassland Household Contract System Policy. However, little is known about how this transition influences GHG emissions. We selected two case study sites representing two different forms of rangeland management systems in Ruoergai county of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, viz. 1) household-based all year continuous grazing under the individual use of rangeland with fences demarcating boundaries; 2) community-based seasonal grazing under the common use of the whole rangeland. The objective was to examine the differences in greenhouse gas emission intensity between the two systems using life cycle assessment (LCA). The results showed that the transition from community-based seasonal grazing into household-based continuous grazing increased the GHG emissions intensity from -0.62 kgCO 2 -eq/kg meat to 10.51 kgCO 2 -eq/kg meat. The increase was primarily attributed to changes in soil carbon storage. Findings suggest that to minimize GHG emissions and environmental degradation, community-based seasonal grazing in the pastoral area of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau should be maintained. Enhancing soil carbon sequestration by adopting appropriate practices would further reduce the GHG emissions intensity arising from the livestock system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Collective action through rural producer marketing organizations can be significant for improving smallholder welfare thus contributing to rural economic growth and poverty alleviation. The purpose of this paper was to examine the impact of farmer group membership on smallholder welfare and poverty. The study compared farmers in producer-marketing organizations and non-members involved in growing mango from the eastern part of Kenya. Propensity score matching method was used to estimate the average treatment effect of group membership on smallholder welfare and poverty. The heterogeneity across propensity score and farm size for the estimated impact were also determined using the smoothing differencing method. A total of 600 households were interviewed comprising of 400 non-members and 200 members. The study shows that group membership significantly improves smallholder total household income and asset holdings, and reduces poverty. This effect is significant for medium-scale farmers participating in collective action as compared to poor small-scale and large-scale farmers. The important factors which determine smallholder participation in collective action include human capital such as age and education level of the household head, market access, natural and physical capital such as total farm size and number of other crops grown. This study expands on the current literature about the effect of collective action on smallholder welfare by investigating the impact on asset holdings and poverty in addition to the total household income. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Climate variability is a major source of risk to smallholder farmers and pastoralists, particularly in dryland regions. A growing body of evidence links climate-related risk to the extent and the persistence of rural poverty in these environments. Stochastic shocks erode smallholder farmers’ long-term livelihood potential through loss of productive assets. The resulting uncertainty impedes progress out of poverty by acting as a disincentive to investment in agriculture – by farmers, rural financial services, value chain institutions and governments. We assess evidence published in the last ten years that a set of production technologies and institutional options for managing risk can stabilize production and incomes, protect assets in the face of shocks, enhance uptake of improved technologies and practices, improve farmer welfare, and contribute to poverty reduction in risk-prone smallholder agricultural systems. Production technologies and practices such as stress-adapted crop germplasm, conservation agriculture, and diversified production systems stabilize agricultural production and incomes and, hence, reduce the adverse impacts of climate-related risk under some circumstances. Institutional interventions such as index-based insurance and social protection through adaptive safety nets play a complementary role in enabling farmers to manage risk, overcome risk-related barriers to adoption of improved technologies and practices, and protect their assets against the impacts of extreme climatic events. While some research documents improvements in household welfare indicators, there is limited evidence that the risk-reduction benefits of the interventions reviewed have enabled significant numbers of very poor farmers to escape poverty. We discuss the roles that climate-risk management interventions can play in efforts to reduce rural poverty, and the need for further research on identifying and targeting environments and farming populations where improved climate risk management could accelerate efforts to reduce rural poverty. © 2018

AB  - Rural households in developing countries face a range of pressures to secure their livelihoods. Households feel the effects of changing rainfall patterns, droughts, cyclones, floods and increased temperatures, and draw on a wide range of resources to adapt but some households are better equipped than others. We explore the extent to which smallholder rural households might be able to adapt to the processes of increased climate variability or climate change through assessing their adaptive capacity using elements of the rural livelihoods framework. We involved almost 600 participants in discussions and interviews in India, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Lao PDR to explore the factors that condition their ability to adapt. We identified 36 key indicators of adaptive capacity, half were specifically related to climate change or climate variability, with others recognized as important in terms of overall livelihoods. “Experience”, “health” and “labour” (Human capital), “access to market” and “farmer networks/groups” (Social capital) were considered strongly enabling of adaptation, whereas “lack of training” (Human capital) and “soil quality/condition” (Natural capital) constrained adaptation. It takes time for households to recover from climatic events, but, households with better access to diverse resources, and a more balanced livelihood portfolio were better able to cope. Mechanisms to support adaptation involved supporting farmer groups, novel information networks, better access to markets and value chains, land ownership, improved financial and economic management, and credit options. © 2018, © 2018 CSIRO Agriculture & Food.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the social institutions of trust, accountability and corporate shared value in creating an enabling environment for private sector investment in African agricultural and food systems. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses mixed methods. A value chain framework models interactions among stakeholders in the agriculture, agribusiness and food sectors. The social institutions of accountability and trust are introduced into the model, followed by a Rwanda premium coffee value chain case study. Findings: The conceptual and case study results show that best practices can increase smallholder farmer, agricultural service provider, financial intermediary, and food processor investments in and benefits from the agriculture sector. Research limitations/implications: Further research is needed on the economic foundations of development cooperation based on trust, accountability and shared values, best practices and the link with desired societal outcomes, such as the sustainable development goals. Social implications: Mutual accountability processes, as they are maturing in Africa, are at the cutting edge of creating processes where multiple stakeholders, including agribusiness, can come together to make joint commitments to a shared development agenda, and where stakeholders hold themselves and others accountable for meeting these commitments. Originality/value: This is the first paper to bring together cutting-edge advances in corporate shared values, trust and accountability in the context of African agricultural and agribusiness development. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Although climate change is a universal phenomenon, its indicators and manifestations are entirely local, as are adaptation choices, strategies, and practices. Based on face-to-face interview data from 427 randomly selected pastoral households of the Hulun Buir grassland in northern China, this study investigated perceptions and impacts of historical climate change and the associations of these perceptions with observed climate change. Meanwhile, we identified pastoralists’ responses to climate change, as well as barriers to the adaptation process. We used binary logistic regression models to determine the factors that influence climate change adaptation strategies. The results show that pastoralists’ perception of the inter-annual variability in climate variables is relatively consistent with the observed meteorological data. Pastoralists’ adaptive strategies for climate variability comprise primarily livestock and pasture management interventions, such as “purchasing fodder”, “reducing livestock”, “part-time grazing”, and “renting pasture”. In addition, pastoralists identified several barriers that are allied with adaptation practices, such as limited grassland tenure, an absence of credit, and limited access to agricultural markets. Furthermore, the sex, age, and education level of the head of household and the household livelihood capital and location were found to be the key factors determining the choice of adaptation strategies. This knowledge helps to assess the needs for action and information and to improve the credibility of policies that shape collective actions based on a unified plan or goal. Combined, these efforts aid in adaptation to reduce the vulnerability of the livestock sector, especially the livelihood security of smallholder pastoralists in grassland ecosystems. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Efforts to slow down and eventually reverse the trend of climate change will take time, and in some cases, the negative impacts of climate change will be felt long before long-term solutions to this problem can bear fruit. Adaptation and mitigation strategies constitute the front line of attack for rural households in developing countries that rely on agricultural production and natural resource use as their main source of income and growth, and whose livelihoods are threatened by climate change. This study models the determinants of adoption of sustainable production practices by coffee producers in the department of Matagalpa, in northern Nicaragua. Using primary survey data, we analyze the extent to which cooperative membership impacts adoption of ten different practices. We find that coffee farmers who belong to cooperatives have adopted sustainable practices at higher rates than non-members, and that the odds of adoption are higher for members than for non-members. A factor analysis was conducted to determine the underlying structural differences between the ten practices, and from this analysis three factors emerged and were modeled. We find that cooperative membership is a significant determinant of practices that promote water conservation, yet not significant for practices that promote soil and plant health, nor for practices related to field management. These findings are valuable for policy makers, donors, and development and extension practitioners in the coffee sector, as they can better inform and guide policies toward more efficient and effective paths of long-term climate change adaptation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Integrating smallholders within global agricultural value chains through contract farming has regained momentum in the development agenda, particularly in Africa. Governments, corporate agri-business, and global development institutions have embraced sugarcane as a suitable commodity to promote the integration of smallholders within commercial agricultural circuits so as to improve the prospects of rural development and reduce rural poverty. Influenced by the new institutional economics paradigm, win-win scenarios in which agribusiness companies and smallholders reciprocally benefit—the former by getting regular and standardized quantities of produce; the latter through secure access to the market—are advocated. However, little evidence of success in contract farming has been provided. By exploring the socio-ecological implications of contract farming within two major agro-industrial complexes (in Uganda and Tanzania), we demonstrate that the incorporation of smallholders in these schemes is spearheading dispossession from below, selection of most competitive producers, ecological degradation, social differentiation, and conflict. © 2019 SAGE Publications.

AB  - An extensive body of theoretical work has advocated the use of multiple human wellbeing indicators to assess the outcomes of agricultural investments in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). However, few studies have actually achieved it. This study investigates the human wellbeing outcomes of involvement in industrial crop production in Ghana by comparing the levels of different objective and subjective wellbeing measures for groups involved in industrial crop production as plantation workers and smallholders, and groups not involved (i.e. control groups). We use household income, adult consumption and the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) as indicators of objective wellbeing. We measure subjective wellbeing through self-reported levels of satisfaction with life, worthwhileness, happiness and anxiousness. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) analysis is used to assess whether involvement in industrial crop production increases household income and consumption. Overall, for most indicators of objective wellbeing industrial crop outgrowers, smallholders and independent smallholders are better off compared to other groups in their respective sites (in terms of mean scores), but involvement does not necessarily brings human wellbeing benefits (PSM analysis). On the other hand plantation workers are either worse off or have similar level of objective human wellbeing with control groups in their respective sites (in terms of mean scores), but involvement sometimes brings human wellbeing benefits (PSM analysis). However, workers tend to benefit from access to plantation infrastructure, which has a positive effect to their multi-dimensional poverty. In most cases the objective wellbeing measures do not correlate well with self-reported levels of subjective wellbeing. It is important to combine such indicators when evaluating the human wellbeing outcomes of agricultural investments in order to obtain a more comprehensive outlook of whether industrial crop production can become a valuable rural development strategy in SSA. © 2019 Ahmed et al.

AB  - Multi-sited households—which straddle rural and urban realms—are increasingly prevalent in riverine Amazonia. Although research on this collective livelihood strategy has focussed on the consequences for tropical forests, less attention has been given to riverine people’s welfare, or the fish and aquatic resources on which they often depend. Based on research conducted in protected area communities and a major urban centre in the Peruvian Amazon, we detail the sources and forms of capital on which dispersed households draw to jointly make a living. Our findings show that natural capital (specifically fisheries resources) drawn from in and around the Pacaya Samiria National Reserve plays a critical role in facilitating and sustaining household dispersal to urban areas through both direct consumption and nature-human capital substitution. These results indicate that meeting social, economic, and environmental sustainability targets on Amazonian floodplains requires accounting for human mobility and diversified livelihoods across expansive geographic areas. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Better management practices (BMPs) for shrimp farming are a standardized set of farming practices to ensure the environmental and financial sustainability of shrimp farming systems. Uniform implementation of the BMPs poses a challenge if most of the shrimp farms in a given region are small (<2 ha). The adoption of BMPs and the associated economics were studied in two districts of Andhra Pradesh, the state that leads India's shrimp production. The overall rate of adoption was approximately 73%. Using factor analysis, all the partly adopted BMPs were categorized into six thematic factors: optimized input supply, improved management practices, routine maintenance, social responsibility, group approach, and culture-system-related and other practices. The ordinary least square regression model explained the factors that influenced the decision to adopt a given practice. These factors included key socio-economic variables such as age, education, and membership of farmers associations. Partial budget analysis revealed that adopting all the recommended BMPs in full would decrease the net returns from each crop by 16.6%. Although adopting the BMPs is voluntary, the practices crucial to the success of a crop were adopted by all the farmers (almost as if it were mandatory to adopt them), whereas those that involved significant costs were left out. Although small farmers can be persuaded to adopt the BMPs through awareness programmes, upgrading their holdings to a size at which a standardized farming system is feasible needs substantial investment. The governments of shrimp-exporting nations should improve their regulatory structure to embrace an inclusive governance model involving all the key actors in the value chain to make the small scale shrimp farming sustainable. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In developing countries contract farming faces numerous challenges that many times lead to its failure. Innovations that help overcome the difficulties of contracting with a large pool of small farmers in such settings can enhance the viability of such schemes. We use a randomized control trial design combined with high frequency data to investigate the impact of adding a nutrition-based incentive in contracts between a Senegalese dairy processing factory and its semi-nomadic milk suppliers. The incentive rewarded suppliers for consistent milk deliveries with daily delivery of a micro-nutrient fortified yogurt for each young child in corresponding households. Findings show large and significant impacts on the frequency and amount of milk delivered, albeit limited to the dry season. We also find larger impacts on milk deliveries when contracts are managed by women. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This study aims at investigating profitability of rice contract farming in Vietnam's Mekong delta. We used data from a farm-household survey comprising of 70 contract and 96 noncontract respondents, and apply the Student's t-test and ordinary least square regression model for data analysis. We found that farmers with larger rice plantations are unlikely to engage in contract farming, and that market outlets and output price for contract growers tend to be ensured compared with noncontract ones. The findings reveal that contract farming has a significantly positive impact on rice-farming profitability in terms of average return and average rate of return on variable cost when controlling for observable characteristics of household and farm. The results suggest that contract farming may enable rice farmers to raise their rice income as well as household income. The policy implication may be that contract farming may not be feasible for all rice farmers and rice business firms. © 2019, Faculty of Economics and Management.

AB  - Agricultural productivity is particularly low in developing countries. Outputsharing rules that make farmers less-than-full residual claimants are seen as a potentially important driver of low agricultural productivity. We report results from a field experiment designed to estimate and understand the effects of sharecropping contracts on agricultural input choices, risk-taking, and output. The experiment induced variation in the terms of sharecropping contracts. After agreeing to pay 50% of their output to the landlord, tenants were randomized into three groups: (i) some kept 50% of their output; (ii) others kept 75%; (iii) others kept 50% of output and received a lump-sum payment at the end of their contract, either fixed or stochastic. We find that tenants with higher output shares used more inputs, cultivated riskier crops, and produced 60% more output relative to control. Income or risk exposure have at most a small effect on farm output; the increase in output should be interpreted as an incentive effect of the output-sharing rule.

AB  - Productivity and cropping intensity on non-tidal wetland in South Sumatra are considerably low and has been underutilized up to now. The majority of farmers in this ecosystem are smallholders with limited adoption capacity on introduced technologies and modern agricultural practices. The objectives of this research were (1) to comprehensively capture multidimensional constrains that restrained local farmers in increasing their agricultural productivity; and (2) to identify, assess, and develop substantially-relevant, financially-affordable, and socially-acceptable agricultural technologies and practices for smallholder farmers to increase productivity. This research was organized in three main activities: qualitative research employing Grounded Theory procedure, quantitative questionnaire-guided survey, and a series of laboratory and field experiments. The research results indicated that the main constraints in increasing productivity and cropping intensity on the non-tidal wetland in South Sumatra include (1) unpredictable flooding occurrence and low soil nutrients content (agronomic constraint), (2) low financial and technology adoption capacity of local farmers (economic constraint), and (3) public policy has not significantly escalated farmer’s motivation to increase food production (social and institutional constraint). This research suggests that multidimensional (technical, financial, ecological, and socio-cultural) approaches should be integrated in collective efforts for sustainably intensifying food production on the non-tidal wetland. © 2019, Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University.

AB  - The Indian government has made significant efforts to promote dairy cooperatives to link the milk producers with consumers. Despite this, milk marketing is still dominated by traditional outlets. This paper examines the impact of modern dairy value chains on food security indicators such as net returns from dairying and consumption expenditures. Using a large, national, farm-level dataset from India and a multinomial endogenous switching regression model, results reveal that Indian dairy farmers’ integration with the modern dairy value chain has a positive and significant impact on their food security (measured by net returns and household consumption expenditures). Participation in modern milk-marketing outlets significantly increases net returns per year, regardless of whether farmers choose one outlet or a combination. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - When the agricultural value chain involves profit making, it results in changes in the production and distribution relationships among men and women in terms of access to and control of markets, resources and benefits emanating from product value chain participation. This affects not only individual incomes but also gender equality. This study examined gender relationships in the cassava value chain in the Kigoma region of Tanzania. The aim was to assess gender participation in the cassava value chain. Multi-stage sampling was used to select the respondents in four districts. A structured questionnaire was administered to 384 randomly selected household heads. A chi-square test was used to test for significant relationships among the variables. Results indicated that gender was significantly related to socio-economic characteristics. About 34% of the women participating in the cassava value chain were young, some below 17 years of age. There were significant relationships between gender and access to resources (land, extension services and markets), control over resources (land, house and household assets) and benefits (revenue) generated from cassava value chains. Overall, there was gender disparity in participation along the cassava value chain. These results suggest that any intervention in the cassava value chain should consider gender relations to benefit men and women and alleviate household poverty. © Cambridge University Press 2017.

AB  - Agricultural households face collective action dilemmas when making decisions about investments in their common household farm and the allocation of resources and benefits derived from it. We relate intrahousehold decisions, as measured in a lab-in-the-field experiment conducted with spouses in agricultural households in western Uganda, with actual investments and intrahousehold resource allocation. Intrahousehold decision-making that supports cooperation and equitable sharing is associated with greater investment in the intensification of cash and food crop production, and more equitable access and control over income. Freeriding behaviour by husbands is associated with the intensification of cash crop production, but not with equitable sharing. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The rise in transnational land deals has brought nationally inflected concerns about foreign land acquisition into uneasy tension with longstanding scholarly and popular concerns about dispossession. Using the case of Chinese rubber plantation promotion projects in northern Laos, we examine the intersection of these two processes during the boom decade of the 2000s, as well as the aftermath during the 2010s, when global rubber prices have fallen. We describe a ‘long’ land grab from upland communities in northern Laos that cannot be blamed on either ‘the Chinese’ (whether private, state or both) or Lao government policy, which has long mobilized political and legal authority to enclose smallholder lands for national development. Rather, what is significant is the interaction of regulatory politics and market dynamics under conditions of both unequal international relations and internally competing policy agendas on both sides of the border. Examining a case where the initial regulatory impulse from the host government was for the protection of smallholder land tenure, the paper demonstrates the need to examine the interaction of local land governance and international relations in a way that treats the latter as the product of internal struggles rather than coherent national strategy. © 2017, © 2017 Regional Studies Association.

AB  - A growing demand for the highly nutritious baobab fruit pulp from Europe and North America raises the question whether the marketing of baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) products could be an opportunity as an income source for rural communities in Kenya, or if the increased demand from overseas would disturb domestic baobab use. To gain an idea of domestic baobab use, a value chain analysis of edible baobab products was performed, using qualitative methods. By using a non-probability sampling, 134 baobab value chain respondents from producers to retailers of baobab products were interviewed on sales data, volumes and profits. Results from an additional household survey, key informant interviews and participatory research were used to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of and to the baobab business. The main actors of the baobab value network were farmers, collectors, wholesalers, processors and retailers; 72 % of the respondents were female. The products most traded were unprocessed pulp-covered seeds and mabuyu, a candy made out of baobab pulp-covered seeds, sugar and food colour. The average value of the product along the mabuyu value chain increased from 0.07 USD per kg of raw pulp-covered seeds paid to the farmer to up to 1.50 USD per kg paid by the end consumer for the mabuyu candy. For farmers, the harvesting and trading with baobab products is an additional source of income during the dry season. Increased commercialisation of baobab products and better integration of farmers into value chains may enhance income, particularly of women. © Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Contract farming (CF) is increasing been used as a strategy in rice production in Ghana while there is no empirical data supporting it. This study investigated the importance of CF in rice production. Cross-sectional farm household level data collected from 350 rice farmers randomly selected across the rice production areas of Ghana was used. The adoption and casual impact of CF was estimated using endogenous switching regression and propensity score matching methods. Results revealed positive and significant relationship between CF and farm performance measures (yield and gross margins). Results indicate that, CF increases yield and gross margins significantly. It further identified educational level, rice farm size and ISFM as positive determinants of contract participation. This evidence provides strong support for efforts to promote CF in Ghana. Educated farmers should be targeted for CF participation because their propensity to participate in CF is high. Sensitising our illiterate farmers to participate in CF should be vigorously pursued. CF should also be encouraged as a means to promote the adoption of ISFM technology. CF is recommended as a good tool for developing the local rice value chain in Ghana. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Agricultural production faces several types of risk, and risk management tools vary by place, season, and crop type. Most farmers use multiple risk-minimizing tools to reduce the effects of various hazards. However, previous research has overlooked the potential connections between different risk management tool utilization decisions. This study examines farmers' decisions of adopting risk management tools (contract farming and precautionary savings) and investigates the impacts of various factors on farmers' risk management decisions by using bivariate and multinomial probit models. The study was carried out in four different agro-ecological regions of Bangladesh with 350 farmers chosen through multistage stratified random sampling procedures. The findings revealed that the farmers' decisions towards adopting risk management tools are correlated, and the adoption of one risk management tool may induce farmers to adopt other risk management tools at that time. Moreover, the results revealed that age, education, income, and land ownership are the major factors affecting the adoption of risk management tools, and most farmers are risk-averse in nature. Both models provide interpretation and information for the development of a better understanding of the current situation of rural farm households, which may serve as a platform for policymakers who are anticipating appropriate risk management tools for the farmers. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Although still controversial among some fisheries management stakeholders, marine protected areas (MPAs) are used worldwide to address fisheries crises. This study focused on the perspectives of fishers in evaluating the effectiveness of an MPA to address their management propositions. The study analysed the drafting and implementation of a multiple-use MPA management plan in the southern coast of Brazil. It evaluated the outcomes in fulfilling the small-scale fishers' proposals, raised and collectively agreed to in a participatory drafting process. Four years after the release of the MPA management plan half of the fishers' proposals were fulfilled. Most of the fishers' fulfilled proposals were related to regulations within the MPA and to strategies to improve their political representativeness, while the majority of the proposals on fishing licensing and on public policies to foster the activity have not yet been achieved. Scale mismatches, authority limitations, and options for innovative institutional arrangements are discussed here as key elements of the results. Additionally, fishers and managers agreed on the increased management performance and learning opportunities created through the participatory process of drafting the management plan, enabling an environment for fulfilling the proposals over the medium and long terms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Facing the challenge of huge population and prominent contradiction between land supply and demand in China, improving the land use efficiency will be a crucial way to solve this contradiction. Based on microscopic sampling data for 703 forestland plots, maintained by 290 rural households, in 30 villages in Liaoning province, and using forestland plots as the decision making unit, the influencing factors of forestland production efficiency were analysed by means of econometric analysis. The results show that increasing household labour and mechanical services helps to improve the production efficiency of forestland. Rural households’ willingness to transfer forestland is weak and the frequency of forestland transfers is relatively low; without action, forestland transfers can be expected to continue to fail to fulfil their potential in stimulating production efficiency. Collective forestland (predominantly public welfare forest) made a limited contribution to forestry production efficiency. From the perspective of property security, although the certification work has more or less been implemented, the factors of property rights certificates, management duration and forestland rights exerted no significant effect on forestland production efficiency. The security and stability of households’ forest property rights urgently need to be consolidated. Moreover, although forest insurance has an important effect on forestland production efficiency, the proportion of households purchasing forest insurance is still low and needs to be improved. The development of forest rights mortgage loans is blocked, and these have not played a significant role in forestland production efficiency to date. Forestry subsidy mechanisms were not sound, and non-subsidized forestland production efficiency was far higher than that of subsidized forest. As such, we conclude that forestry subsidies have failed to play a positive role in increasing efficiency. In order to promote forestland production efficiency and the sustainable growth of forestry, it is essential that emphasis be placed on forestland inputs, plot characteristics, property security and policy subsidies for micro-plots. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Understanding barriers to market access for smallholder farmers and their marketing efficiency when they participate in agricultural value chains is key to unlocking the market potential and overcoming market failures. This study aimed at determining factors limiting farmers’ market access, the break-even point for undertaking postharvest value addition activities by the farmers, and the market efficiency of the Uganda potato market chains in which the smallholder farmers are participating. Our study was based on the hypothesis that market access and efficiency are higher where farmers have contract arrangements with buyers, and where they are directly linked with the buyers at the end of the value chain. The study was carried out in the popular potato growing districts of Kabale and Mbale in Uganda. The survey involved purposive selection of the study areas and random selection of potato farmers and traders. We used an Ordinary Least Square model to determine factors that influence potato smallholder farmers’ market access. We also used break-even analysis to determine the break-even point for potato farmers to take up postharvest value addition activities, and a value addition approach to determine market efficiency. Results indicate that having a contract with buyers, size of land owned, number of forked hoes owned and variety grown positively and significantly influenced farmer market access. We found that adding value to potato on farm earns farmers relatively more income. A farmer would earn 25% higher than when no value addition was done. Market chains where farmers sell to local rural traders were more efficient than selling to other alternatives. We recommend farmer involvement in value addition, collective and/or contractual marketing, and selling directly to the nearest actor in the value chain. © 2018

AB  - The JYNNR – a Ramsar Site, Biosphere Reserve and important wintering ground for 15–18% of the world's Red Crowned Cranes – faces major pressure from regional development. This paper uses choice experiments to assess farmer preferences for an “eco-compensation” program targeting pesticide use by rural communities in and near the Jiangsu-Yancheng Coastal Wetlands Rare Birds National Nature Reserve (JYNNR). “Eco-compensation” is a China-specific term encompassing many incentive-based environmental management approaches. To identify options to reconcile rural welfare improvement with conservation, data was collected from 311 rural households in and near the JYNNR assessing perceptions of the JYNNR, wetland birds, use and impact of pesticides, and preferences for contracts to mitigate pesticide impacts. Results suggest that conflict with the JYNNR is growing, and that pesticide management could be an effective entry-point for engagement. The analysis finds several options for cost-effective contracts: granting rights to leave the program without penalty and increasing share of household land enrolled significantly reduce willingness-to-accept-payment (WTA), while longer contracts and larger reductions in pesticide use increase WTA, which interact meaningfully with farmer characteristics. Providing communities with training and technical support on proper pesticide use could, under specific contract structures, be sufficient to induce 100% enrollment without subsidies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The peanut is the world's second most important legume, and peanut and peanut-based products have a large potential in the Philippines and other tropical developing countries both in terms of import substitution and export promotion. This study used survey data to describe the socioeconomic and technological level of peanut farmers in major peanut-producing areas in the country, and determine the adoption factors and constraints for selected technologies. A total of 296 farmers in 10 provinces were interviewed in 2015. The binary logit model was applied to explore the farm-level factors affecting the adoption of selected technologies (seed inoculant, seed treatment, chemical fertilizer and pesticides) for peanut farming. Results indicate that decision factors vary per technology but relatively consistent drivers to technology adoption are farmer gender, attendance to seminar or training in peanut production, availability of irrigation source, and membership in organization. Household size was an adoption constraint in select technologies. Technology uptake was also influenced by regional differences. Implications are increased provision of seminars and trainings for peanut farmers; facilitation of farmers’ organizations; support by local government units (LGUs) in technology promotion, and ensuring adequate irrigation. Informing decision makers on the factors and constraints to adoption of these technologies will largely make for evidence-based policymaking. The adoption of the selected technologies covered in this study will not only improve farmers’ yield and income, but may eventually contribute to lower production cost per unit and lower prices in the long run, which has implications to the whole value-chain of peanut and peanut-based products. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Low-return livelihood strategies are crucial drivers of food insecurity that may cause irreversible long-term damage to livelihoods. Experiments and survey results were used to examine the relative importance of risk preference and socio-economic characteristics for households' decision to engage in specific livelihood strategies in rural Ethiopia. Agricultural intensification and diversification are prevailing strategies, and farming households who participate in non-farm activities are better off than others. Education, information access, household income and cooperative membership correlate significantly with high participation rates in non-farm activities and on-farm diversification. Risk preference is an especially important barrier to households' participation in these strategies. Therefore, policy interventions that help to expand farmers' asset base and reduce entry barriers to these strategies are required to improve smallholders' welfare.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: This is the first study of global trade in fruits of the widely used traditional medicine, Helicteres isora L. It is used in Ayurvedic, Siddha, Unani medical systems and/or local folk traditional medicines in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. The roots are used in Traditional Chinese Medicines in China and the fruits in jamu products in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. In addition, H. isora fruits are also used in “traditional” medical systems far beyond the natural distribution of this species, for example in Zulu herbal medicine (South Africa) and Kurdish herbal medicines (Iraq). Aims of the study: This study had three aims: (i) to assess the global trade in H. isora fruits; (ii) to study the H. isora trade from West Timor to Java in terms of actors and prices along the value chain and (iii) to get a better understanding of the potential of this species to improve household income in eastern Indonesia. Materials and methods: This study uses historical records, a contemporary analysis of global trade data (2014–2016) and field assessments of value chains and the biological factors influencing H. isora fruit production. Results: Globally, the major exporter of H. isora fruits is India, which exports H. isora fruits to 19 countries, far beyond the natural geographical distribution of this species. Over a 36-month period (January 2014–December 2016), India exported 392 t of H. isora fruits, with a Free-On-Board (FOB) value of Indian rupiah (INR) 18,337,000 (US$ 274,055). This represents an average annual export quantity of about 130,526 kg/year. Over this three year period, most of these exports (85.5%) were to Indonesia (346.58 t), followed by Thailand (6.85%). Indian H. isora exports are also used in many other medical systems, including Kurdish and Zulu “traditional” medicines in Iraq and South Africa. Formation of an Indian diaspora in Bahrain, Mauritius, South Africa, Tanzania and Trinidad and Tobago over the past 130 years is one of the drivers of H. isora fruit trade outside the natural geographic distribution of the species. In Indonesia, demand for H. isora fruits is supplemented by an intra-island trade in Java and an inter-island trade from East Nusa Tenggara. West Timor, for example, exports around 31–37 t of air-dried H. isora fruits per year to Java. At the farm gate, local harvesters in West Timor get 4000 IDR (c. 0.3 US$) per kg, with businesses in Java paying 25,000 IDR (c.US$2) per kg for H. isora fruits. This is similar to the price paid for H. isora fruits imported from India to Java. Conclusions: India is the major exporter of whole dried H. isora fruits, including to countries where this species has never been in traditional use. In Indonesia, H. isora fruit extracts are used in the cosmetic industry as well as in jamu herbal medicines, including “Tolak Angin” the country's most popular commercial “jamu” preparation. Indonesia also is the major importer of H. isora fruits from India. In eastern Indonesia, improved income to local villagers from the H. isora fruit trade could come from improved H. isora fruit quality due to better drying techniques. This would also reduce health risks along the supply chain from to mycotoxins that have been recorded on poorly dried H. isora fruits. There also is an opportunity for cultivation of H. isora in small-holder teak plantations in Indonesia, with harvest of H. isora fruits as well as the medicinal bark. © 2018

AB  - Central to food security interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa stands the value chain approach. The underlying idea is that connecting farmers to input and output markets and sources of knowledge and technology will enhance their food security status. In spite of positive impacts measured in especially food supply, there is scant evidence of the long-term effects on food security. For a better grasp of the impacts of a maize value chain intervention in North Ghana, we have experimented with an approach that focuses on interactions and feedback loops between the value chain and its local context. Such approach allowed us to identify dynamics that affect food security in the long run. In the case of Northern Ghana farming systems, household income and diets are increasingly dependent on maize, which increases risk of food insecurity in case of climate setbacks or market shocks. The exercise reveals how a linear value chain approach obscures the dynamic effects cascading from the intervention that may actually hamper food security in the long run. A systems approach may help to better grasp the consequences of external interventions at the local level. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This study identifies the livelihood strategies pursued by small cacao farmers in the Guayas coastal region in Ecuador, where two distinct cacao varieties are grown: the fine flavor variety, Cacao Nacional (CN), and a hybrid variety (CCN-51). Enhancing CN production is regarded as an economic development strategy since CN variety beans are characterized by premium prices in international markets. This study aims to assess the trade-offs faced by small cacao producers in the production of specialty (CN) vs. commodity (CCN-51) cacao and how they affect their livelihoods. A detailed household survey sampled 188 households. Based on activity variables, four latent profiles of livelihood strategies were identified, which were related to capital asset endowment and income share variables. The results show that there was not a clear gap between cultivation of CN and CCN-51, as 60% of the sampled households simultaneously grew both varieties. The results indicate that the variable “share of land allocated to CN” does not significantly contribute to discriminating among profiles. Households with a low share of land allocated to CCN-51 showed higher income diversification strategies and vice versa. Our study also shows that the lack of appropriate incentives may threaten the future cultivation of CN since the National policy for CN rehabilitation has had little impact on the more cacao-driven profiles that have a lower asset endowment. The design, structuring and maintenance of a domestic differentiated value chain for the CN variety, together with income diversification measures and prior improvement on the asset endowment of these profiles, seems to be the pathway to improve the livelihoods of small farmers and increase the success of the current policy for fine flavor cacao rehabilitation at the national level. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lentils, a low-value and highly nutritious crop, are Nepal's largest pulse cash crop. However, the majority of the nation's smallholders produce lentils on very small plots of land. The large gap in lentil yields between Nepal and other lentil-producing countries underscores the importance of improving yields and income of smallholders. When it comes to the financial viability of small farms, particularly in developing countries, and globalisation, contract farming (CF) may prove useful in achieving efficiency and profitability in smallholder lentil farms in Nepal. This study employs the propensity score matching approach to examine the effects of the adoption of CF on yields, profitability and costs of smallholder lentil farms in Nepal. Findings from this study reveal that contrary to popular belief, CF adoption by lentil producers in Nepal has a positive and significant effect on per-hectare revenues, profits and yield and a negative impact on variable and transportation costs. The study finds that only very smallholder lentil farms (0.01-0.05 ha) benefit from CF. © 2018 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.

AB  - This paper uses a global commodity chain (GCC) framework to explore the nexus of illicit economic activities and rural change. We unpack the micro-level economic processes by which a de facto land grab in eastern Honduras’ Moskitia region was catalyzed and accelerated by the region's ascendance as a global hub of cocaine transit (ca. 2008–2012). We show how ‘narco-brokers’ mobilized a long-standing economic infrastructure to harness land and labor in the service of moving drugs, and how these ‘mid-stream’ activities captured millions of dollars from the cocaine commodity chain. We detail the processes by which those dollars ultimately concentrated land among in situ and ex situ elites by profoundly distorting social relations around land governance, labor, food production, and—ultimately—land ownership. The result was widespread dispossession, land and resource privatization, increased food insecurity, community conflict, and increased social stratification. Lands transferred from resident smallholders to elites helped to (a) integrate the region horizontally into Honduras’ rentier-based cattle economy, and (b) improve the vertical integration of the pan-hemispheric cocaine trade through the speculation and profit- laundering services that the region's enclosure provided. This case highlights how economic coercions work synergistically with the more well-studied role of overt physical violence in frontier land grabs. We urge greater attention to the role of illicit capital in agrarian transformation globally. The study also points to the potential for transit spaces to shed much light on the workings of (illicit) global commodity chains and illicit economic geographies more broadly. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Certification and participation in farmer organisations are associated with economic and social benefits for farmers. However, knowledge about the differences in the perceived benefits of participation in different organisations and certification schemes is limited. In this paper, we distinguish between three types of farmer organisations in the Indonesian coffee sector: farmer groups, cooperatives, and KUBEs. We compare the benefits farmers perceive from participating in these forms of organisations, including the benefits for unorganised farmers and farmers in different certification schemes (Fair Trade, UTZ, the Rainforest Alliance, and 4C). We find that certified farmers perceive higher benefits than uncertified farmers, and that organised farmers perceive higher benefits than unorganised smallholders. Farmers who hold dual membership (in a farmer group and a KUBE or cooperative) perceive greater benefits than farmers who participate in farmer groups. Although farmers in different certification schemes significantly differ in the benefits they perceive, we could not identify clear patterns based on the schemes. We conclude that integration of the different organisational forms, as well as a more concentrated collaboration between the ministries underlying each organisational form, may improve the benefits perceived by farmers in the Indonesian coffee sector. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Agriculture is critical to sustainable development, and agricultural production by smallholders in lower-income countries contributes substantially to the food security of both rural and urban populations. Smallholders face many challenges related to urbanisation, sustainable use of natural resources and climate change. While there will be different ways of achieving sustainable agricultural systems, all will involve adaptation on a massive scale to meet the future food production challenge at greatly reduced carbon cost. Here we evaluate recent progress in agricultural adaptation using surveys in five regions, 21 countries and 45 sites, covering 315 villages and approximately 6300 households. These surveys include information about the changes made to farming systems in the last decade. We synthesise this information by grouping households into types: food insecure, hanging in, stepping up and stepping out. We then profile each site in terms of its proportion of households of these four types. While farmers have made some changes in their farming practices over the last decade, most changes have been incremental and piecemeal. We find little evidence in the study sites in any region of farming changes at the scale needed to enhance food security of significant proportions of the population. Searching for commonalities in the enabling environment among sites with similar proportions of household types, we found collective action at the community level coupled with appropriate climate information provision and the active participation of local organisations to be associated with higher levels of food security. To foster the changes needed in agricultural and food systems, a much stronger focus will be required on the enabling environment if food security goals are to be attainable. Without more nuanced and effective targeting of technological as well as institutional interventions, agricultural adaptation to meet the food production challenge in the coming decades is unlikely to occur. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - This study investigates the impact of contract farming (CF) through cooperatives in tomatoes on employment and economic performance of smallholders in a low-income developing country. Using farm-level data from Nepal and a nonparametric matching estimator, the study finds a negative and significant effect of CF on employment. However, CF through cooperatives has a positive and significant impact on profits, and yield. We find that small farms (≤0.51 ha) with contracts tend to gain in profits and yield per hectare. However, large farms (>0.85 ha) with contracts employ significantly less hired labor per hectare. Finally, our estimates reveal that, compared to independent producers, smallholder households in Nepal that engaged in CF with both input and output conditions received, on average, higher profits and yield. Findings underscore the importance of cooperatives and CF. [EconLit citations: C31, D23, Q12, Q13]. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Agricultural intensification and extensification are standard responses to ecological and economic vulnerability among smallholder communities. Climate change has exacerbated this vulnerability and thrown the complexity of and critical need for managing a healthy natural resource base while increasing on-farm productivity into sharp light. Sustainable intensification is one of many mechanisms for accomplishing this balancing act. This study examines the adoption of sustainable intensification practices, namely input packages focused on tef row planting—designed to boost yield and promote more efficient use of inputs. This study utilized a mix methods approach to survey 115 smallholder farmers in the South Wollo zone of the Amhara region in Ethiopia. This study found that cash and capital, more so than contact with the AIS, influenced farmers’ decisions to adopt row planting input packages. Khat production was an important source of cash for inputs and was more likely to be available to farmers with irrigation schemes. Long-term, farmers who cultivate khat may not successfully engage in SI, as khat replaces traditional food crop production in the region. Yet, for farmers who do not grow khat, long-term investment in SI practices is unlikely unless access to affordable credit options is improved. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The public debate about the right type of agriculture for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) often constructs a dichotomy between smallholders and large-scale agriculture. This over-simplification ignores some important intermediary forms for organising agriculture, including nucleus-outgrower schemes (NOSs). NOSs promise to combine the benefits of both while potentially reducing, though not avoiding, (part of) their drawbacks. This article analyses the conditions under which NOSs are feasible and beneficial for investors, outgrowers and rural development for selected value chains in Tanzania. It is based on an empirical study comprising 276 qualitative interviews with various stakeholders conducted in central Tanzania in spring 2015 on 10 NOSs in three subsectors (rice, sugar cane and tea) in different stages of realisation (planning, establishment, full production and failure or near-failure). The study examines why investments succeed or fail in different stages, the socio-economic impacts and various policies important for their fate. Findings show that there are many challenges to successfully implementing NOSs in Tanzania, including national policies on the business environment, on agriculture in general and on specific subsectors, and, especially, on land issues. Nevertheless, these schemes seem to have considerable potential to support local development, particularly by providing employment and salaries, incomes for outgrower farmers, infrastructure and corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects as compensation for loss of access to land for the community. The specific details of a particular business model influence the opportunities and risks, but no single model seems to be superior; much depends on the subsector structure and the services already available. In general, policies to attract and steer NOSs in Tanzania are not yet sufficiently developed, coordinated or implemented. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Enhancing food security is the main goal of subsistence farmers, who are vulnerable to food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa. Participatory research across food value chains (FVC) can help stabilize and enhance food security by developing upgrading strategies (UPS). However, prior to successful widespread adoption and geographical upscaling, such practices need in-depth understanding of their suitability in target areas and their particular local requirements. Ex-ante assessments of selected UPS were carried out by German and Tanzanian agricultural scientists using the “ScalA-FS” tool. The participating experts included those responsible for implementation. The tool aims to systematically evaluate, at the community level, UPS that have been successfully implemented elsewhere, evaluate their potential for dissemination, and identify entry points for adjustments during implementation. Assessment indicators were developed through a participatory process. UPS relate to a) natural resource management and crop production; b) food processing and bioenergy; c) income generation and market participation; and d) food consumption. Here we present the ScalA-FS assessment results on UPS suitability as well as on its implementation requirements. We focused on the local context needed to enable a productive collaboration between smallholder farmers and implementing research and/or development organizations. Implementation requirements for the selected UPS were assessed as generally low to medium, and projected suitability in most cases was high. Local knowledge and education (human capital) along with visible success after a short time were important criteria of success of UPS. Here, careful consideration of the challenges before and after implementation of UPS is suggested. ScalA-FS should be applied early in the implementation process of UPS in order to support adaptations and successful upscaling at other locations. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature and International Society for Plant Pathology.

AB  - This article investigates smallholder market linkages in food value chains in sub-Saharan Africa, using Tanzania as a case study. Specifically, we analysed the status and drivers of market linkages among farmers, and their impact on agricultural income and food security. The analysis is based on nationally representative household survey data, using a combination of descriptive statistics and econometric approaches. Although most farmers in Tanzania are integrated into agricultural markets, their level of commercialization is very low, with an average of only 30% of their crop production sold. Around 15% of farmers who sell crops have access to potentially more rewarding market linkages (e.g. through cooperatives or contract farming). The econometric results show that, controlling for a number of confounding factors, farmers with market linkages are more commercialized, and receive significantly higher producer prices and crop income than those without such linkages. However, in spite of these positive results, we did not find significant differences in terms of household food security. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature and International Society for Plant Pathology.

AB  - Smallholder agriculturalists employ a range of strategies to adapt to climate variability. These adaptive strategies include decisions to plant different seed varieties, changes to the array of cultivated crops, and shifts in planting dates. Smallholder access to irrigation water is crucial to the adoption of such strategies, and uncertainty of water availability may prove to be a stimulating force in a smallholder's decision to adjust their on-farm practices. Within smallholder irrigation systems, attributes at multiple levels influence water availability and collective action, and in the process play a role in adaptation: community-level governance institutions may influence trust in others and the ability to overcome appropriation and provisioning dilemmas, and, at the household-level, the availability of irrigation water and socioeconomic and demographic factors may influence farmer willingness to take on the risk of altering their on-farm practices. In this study we investigate smallholder adaptation in Kenya from multiple levels. Specifically, we identify the role of household- and community-level characteristics in shaping smallholder experimentation with different seed varieties. Standard ordinary least squares and logistic regressions are constructed to assess the influence of these interactions on smallholder adaptation. We further discuss the ability of smallholders to respond to poor water provisioning. Among the study's findings is evidence that smallholders are more willing to employ adaptive measures if they have a limited capacity to irrigate. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this paper is to evaluate and analyze the impact of adoption of soil conservation practices (SCPs) on the technical efficiency of smallholder rice producers in Central China. We address self-selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity problems by estimating a switching regression model for the adoption decision function and separate stochastic production frontiers for SCP and Conventional farms while allowing for production inefficiency. SCP farms exhibit statistically higher average technical efficiency than Conventional farms. Education, extension services, membership in cooperatives, access to credit, and alternative income sources are positively and significantly associated with technical efficiency for both groups. Conventional farms display higher partial output elasticity for land, while only SCP farms show significant elasticity for capital. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Rural populations in the developing world face great challenges in climate adaptation and human development. Broader development and climate adaptation can potentially enhance each other, and their positive synergies are essential to improve human well-being in less developed rural areas. Such synergies are, however, commonly lacking across developing countries. This paper examines the relationship between climate adaptation and broader development and finds a positive synergy in the Poyang Lake Region (PLR)–an important rice producing area in China that is vulnerable to flood hazards. We further examine household decision-making and link household decisions to rice cropping patterns interpreted from satellite images to explain the micro- to macro- mechanisms that lead to this synergy. The analysis shows that both the broader development context (national economic development and agricultural policy) and specific risk management (levees) are important for creating the positive synergy. Moreover, it is the right interactions of the social, natural, and technological subsystems that enable rural households to make different land-use and livelihood choices in a way that improves rural livelihoods and reduces flood impacts on rural livelihoods. The diverse household choices then collectively lead to preservation of rice production, despite the negative influence from increasing nonfarm work, and decreased flood impacts on agriculture. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Family farming plays important roles in agricultural production and the world's food security. This paper provides an econometric analysis of income, productivity and diversification of Brazilian smallholders. Using the most updated data from the Ministry of Agrarian Development (MDA) enables a more precise analysis than traditional agri-census data. The database contains approximately 4.7 million family farmers from all regions of the country. We used linear and tobit regression to untangle useful information behind these large datasets. The results demonstrated that the smallholders that are part of an agricultural cooperative or a member of a farmer's association positively affect income, productivity and diversification. The age of household heads is shown to have a non-linear relationship in the three cases, while the household head being female presented a negative effect in all regressions. Although recent technical assistance showed negative impacts on income and productivity, farmer's assistance positively affected the likelihood of a smallholder diversifying their production and, therefore, becoming less subject to price imbalances. The results support current views in the field of smallholder farming while presenting marked regional differences of a continental country, enabling policy makers to make better, more informed decisions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agricultural land in northern Ghana is a common pool resource predominantly governed by longstanding customary land tenure provisions. Following the renewed emphasis at achieving a new green revolution for Africa since the last decade, the government of Ghana has prioritized the provision of improved land preparation technologies to smallholder farmers. Although the uptake of these technologies has introduced speed and efficiency in land preparation, there are concerns about the impacts on customary land tenure systems. Drawing on the experiences of smallholder farmers (n = 60) in northern Ghana using in-depth interviews, we examine the dynamics in contemporary agricultural land access and governance following decades of progressive agricultural modernization. Our findings show that agricultural modernization has intensified agricultural land use and exposed the customary land governance system to more rival claims over agricultural commons that were previously owned and cultivated collectively under the extended family system. Given the current ambiguities in the interpretation of customary tenure and concomitant intra-familial land grabbing among smallholder farmers which we term ‘intimate dispossession’ most farmers have resorted to diverse personal tenure protection strategies towards enhancing their land use rights at the expense of co-family members. We advocate a land reform that prioritizes formal registration of agricultural lands to avoid future ambiguities in ownership and a cycle of farmland take-overs. With increasing pressure from other competing land uses, land banking should be prioritized to ensure tenure security for smallholder farmers, particularly weaker social groups and individuals within families who are often at risk of intra-familial land grabbing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Might a malaria control intervention entail agricultural effects that allow a commercial agribusiness to offset its costs? The randomized allocation of 39,936 insecticide-treated mosquito nets among 81,597 smallholder cotton farming households in 1,507 clusters helps evaluate this in the context of Zambia's cotton outgrowing industry. But despite large health impacts on treated households, no impact on cotton deliveries to the agribusiness is detected. With some caveats, the results tend to strike a discord with recent evidence on the agricultural productivity effects of malaria control. © The Author 2016.

AB  - The decentralization framework and the Dublin Principles on Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) emphasize the need for a participatory approach to irrigation water management. This study identifies the factors influencing farmers' decision to, and extent of participation in the maintenance of irrigation infrastructure in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa based on cross-section data collected from 320 randomly selected smallholder irrigating farmers. A two-step Heckman regression model was applied in the analysis. It was established that households whose heads were older, block committee members, with larger irrigation plots, good soil quality and experiencing severe irrigation water shortages are more likely to participate in maintenance of irrigation infrastructure. On the other hand, farmers with insecure land tenure and with no access to irrigation water were less likely to make the decision to participate. Farmers who were members of the farming cooperative as well as block committee members and those paying irrigation water costs were likely to intensively participate in maintaining irrigation infrastructure. Therefore, decentralization alone cannot lead to improved irrigation outcomes. Several factors are necessary for households to participate intensively in the maintenance of irrigation infrastructure. Governments should address these challenges before handing irrigation schemes to their beneficiaries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Knowledge on the link between French beans farmers’ attitudes toward risks and Global-GAP compliance decisions is limited in Kenya. A social experiment (Lottery games involving real pay-offs) was implemented on 119 randomly selected farmers to solicit risk attitudes and Binary Logit Model to determine the effect of risk attitudes on compliance decisions. Majority of non-certified farmers (24 percent) were risk averse relative to certified farmers (4.3). Non-certified farmers were more averse towards losses (p=0.062|MD=0.50). Farmer's probability weighting (p=0.046), aversion to loss (p=0.094), contract farming (p=0.000) and daily household expenditure per adult equivalent significantly and negatively affected compliance decisions while risk aversion (p=0.081), annual asset value (p=0.092) and acreage under French beans (p=0.033) significantly and positively affected compliance decisions. The results suggest that crop insurance and affordable credit is important in mitigation of potential production and marketing risks in French bean farming. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Farmers in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta face a wide range of climate-related and hydrological factors which threaten rice production. Smallholder farmers must adapt to climate change to sustain rice production as their central and most important livelihood activity. A sample was stratified across agro-ecological areas in the Delta affected by flooding, alluvial soils, acid sulphate soils, and saline water intrusion and by derived farmer typologies. A rural livelihoods approach was used in focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to identify and enumerate enabling and constraining adaptation factors. Smallholders experienced diverse natural hazards such as floods, abnormal rains, high temperatures, water scarcity, and salinity intrusion specific to the agro-ecological areas. Adaptation was constrained by labour shortages, water quality, topography, access to combine harvesters, transportation infrastructure, dryers and household savings. Adaptation was enabled by farming techniques and experience, cooperative groups, water quantity, access to information, and ability to purchase agro-chemicals through credit. Small farmers (< 1 ha) were more constrained than large farmers (> 1 ha) who had an expanded livelihood asset base. A range of policy implications are discussed, but adaptation is not just about technological fixes but requires overall improvements in a range of human, social and financial components. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Smallholder farmers in developing countries face a competitive disadvantage in modern agricultural supply chains. Joint marketing through cooperatives is a potential tool to mitigate these disadvantages; yet cooperatives’ success in these settings is uneven at best. We develop an analytical model to study a farmer's choice of selling to a private trader who pays cash on delivery but may exercise market power or a cooperative that promises a price premium but delays payment and carries a concomitant risk of default. In the presence of impatient and risk-averse farmers, we show that these factors can severely limit smallholder patronage of a cooperative, despite a promised price premium. We then construct and parameterize a simulation model to fit a profile of heterogeneous farmers within a prototype developing-country village, and study the optimal decisions of farmers regarding marketing through a cooperative versus a private trader. Results suggest that modest improvements in either timeliness of payment or probability of default can induce a substantial increase in a cooperative's market share and economic viability. Extending the simulation analysis to a dynamic setting shows how implementing reasonable policies to improve a cooperative's payment timeliness and default probability can markedly improve its growth trajectory. © 2018 International Association of Agricultural Economists

AB  - Voluntary standards and certification schemes aim to play an important role in the creation of a more sustainable production of agricultural commodities in the South. In this paper, we contend that most studies on the sustainability of these certifications take the objectives of voluntary standard-setting and certifying arrangements as the reference point, thereby implicitly accepting a problem definition that is not necessarily aligned with the needs, interests and preferences of the smallholder producers in a developing context. Based on the results of a four years research project on coffee and palm oil smallholders and certifications in Indonesia, this paper questions the transformative capacity of the standards and certifications regarding a more sustainable agricultural production. This capacity is located at the interface of the global demands, which are channeled down from the top of the value chain, and the local context where local producers take their decisions. Based on the empirical research it is argued that voluntary standards and certifications pave the way for a more sustainable agricultural production, but are not necessarily the right way forward to a more systemic change. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In light of the current depletion of extractive marine resources and the sustainability issues that have arisen in the aquaculture industry, the small-scale aquaculture sector has emerged as a viable and sustainable alternative for generating income. To integrate the small-scale aquaculture sector into the food value chain, understanding the decision-making process to innovate becomes essential. This paper explores the factors underlying both innovation choices and intensity among small-scale aquaculture producers by utilizing exclusive census data from the small-scale aquaculture sector in Chile. The results indicate that education, secure property rights, internet access, participation in organizations, commercialization methods, government instruments, understanding of credit, and social learning promote innovation decisions. We also find that largest producers innovate in more areas, suggesting a role of size for both technological and non-technological innovations. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Liquid biofuel production has been widely promoted as a rural development strategy in the South. Yet, the development of biofuel value chains faces many context-specific challenges. In this empirical study we use a labelled choice experiment to assess smallholder farmer preferences for alternative production systems, value chain organisations and market developments for a biofuel program using oilseed trees (neem (Azadirachta indica), pongamia (Millettia pinnata), mahua (Madhuca longifolia)) in Karnataka state, India. Our results demonstrate that biofuel programs can benefit from ex ante analyses to improve their design. We find that most farmers (71%) are likely to adopt biofuel trees in most scenarios, especially species with relatively high yields, low labour requirements and high oilseed prices. Nevertheless, value chain reorganization through contracting and labour provision proves to be the key lever to stimulate adoption. This calls for further research on effective contract design and implementation, and for developing alternative business models. Our results imply that next to high opportunity costs of land, also high opportunity costs of labour can be a barrier to biofuel tree adoption. If biofuel programs are to succeed, they have to move beyond the idea of smallholder biofuel production on marginal lands with surplus labour. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Despite the vast research on contract farming by agrarian scholars, little is known about interactions between biological risks and the social–political effects of contracts. This study analysed contract farming arrangements in the export banana industry in the Philippines amidst an expanding epidemic of Panama disease. We developed a political ecology of risk approach to investigate how ideas about technological and biological risks are influenced by contractual arrangements, and we borrowed from Cultural Theory the insight that risk and blame are connected concepts, always political, and disadvantage marginalized groups through disproportionate risk burdens. Data collection involved the study of contracts, interviews with decision-makers, and focus group discussions with agrarian cooperatives. The views of both large corporations as well as organized smallholders were recorded. We found that the former contractually compel the latter to bear the burden of the disease, while blaming them for its spread. Risk decisions were embedded in the dynamics of agrarian social relationships, and economic and political arrangements between actors influenced possibilities and limitations for disease control. We argue that the contractual stipulations, in concert with blaming processes, create a discursive environment that both allow inequitable relations to remain unquestioned, and constrain possibilities for control of Panama disease. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses continue to threaten smallholder poultry producers in several South-east Asian countries, including Vietnam. In particular, the free-grazing duck system has been repeatedly highlighted as a major risk factor for HPAI outbreaks. Free-grazing ducks, which scavenge on rice paddies after the harvest, account for a large proportion of the duck population in Vietnam and the wider South-east Asian region. However, the structure and dynamics of the free-grazing duck production from farm to consumption has not been described for Vietnam. In this study, we used a value chain approach to provide a complete picture of the actors involved in the production and marketing of free-grazing duck eggs and spent layer ducks, as well as to investigate the governance structure of this food system. Group interviews and key informant interviews were conducted in two provinces located in the Mekong River Delta (MRD) and the Red River Delta (RRD). The results presented here highlight similarities and differences in farming and trade practices between the two provinces. The trade of spent layer ducks involved large volumes of live ducks being sent to China and Cambodia for consumption, generating a substantial risk of transboundary spread of pathogens, including HPAI viruses. We describe the major role of “duck yards”, which act as hubs in the northbound trade of spent layer ducks. These yards should be considered as essential links in the value chain of spent layer ducks when considering HPAI surveillance and control. The veterinary authorities are only marginally involved in the value chain activities, and their influence could be strengthened by increasing surveillance activities for instance in duck yards. Last, we discuss the dynamics of the duck value chain and further implications for future HPAI management policies. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: Several development organisations have implemented programs to enhance smallholder farmers’ crop productivity and market access through collective action with mixed results. Therefore, this study examines the drivers of success of collective action initiatives as a pathway to improving farmers marketing performance using data from Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses primary data collected from 30 farmer groups through focus group discussions. These groups are assessed for differences in their marketing performance using descriptive and cluster analysis techniques. Findings: Most of the group members are poor (67%) and few are considered as rich (2%) or middle class (28%), while the rest are destitute. The destitute community members are often excluded from the groups due to their own passivity and inability to contribute financial resources for joint activities. Mature farmer groups with strong internal structures and greater participation in product bulking as well as formally organised groups with stable external links significantly have higher marketing performance. Practical implications: We recommend that for farmers to maximise the benefits of collective action, supportive policies are necessary to encourage the formation of groups and transform existing ones into business entities to access high-value markets and perhaps even export markets. Farmer groups need to intensify their market research to access ready and stable markets such as supermarkets and institutions with larger volumetric requirements. Theoretical implications: The study shows that collective action is important for smallholder farmers in developing countries to sustainably access markets and increase their marketing performance. Originality/Value: Few studies have examined how social capital and collective action are utilised to improve smallholder farmers marketing performance, particularly in Central Africa. © 2018 Wageningen University.

AB  - In this article, we develop a dynamic model to show how membership in agricultural cooperatives influences smallholder farmers' decisions to invest in organic soil amendments and chemical fertilizer. The model considers management decisions of heterogonous producers within an intertemporal framework, with the decision to join the cooperative assumed to be endogenous. Farm-level data of apple farmers from three provinces in China are used to estimate the impact of cooperative membership on investment in organic soil amendments and chemical fertilizer. A recursive bivariate probit model that accounts for potential endogeneity of cooperative membership and selection bias is employed in the empirical analysis. The empirical results show that cooperative membership exerts a positive and statistically significant impact on the likelihood of investing in organic soil amendments. The findings also reveal that tenure security, human capital, farm size, and access to credit positively and significantly influence the probability of a farmer joining a cooperative and the likelihood of investing in soil quality measures. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The lack of land ownership can discourage agricultural technology adoption, yet there is scarce evidence of the impact of land rental contracts on the adoption of improved crop varieties in developing countries. The current study investigates such impact using a nationally representative survey of Ethiopian maize farmers. In contrast to many previous studies, we show in a simple model that cash-renters are as likely to adopt improved maize varieties as owner-operators, while sharecroppers are more likely to adopt given that such varieties are profitable. Empirical analysis reveals a significant impact of sharecropping on improved maize variety adoption, and no significant impact from cash-rental, lending support to the above hypotheses. These results imply that improvements in land rental markets can potentially enhance household welfare through crop variety adoption in agrarian economies where land sales markets are incomplete or missing. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - India's Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is the largest labour guarantee scheme in the world, offering 100 days of paid labour to every rural household. This article reviews the growing evidence base, assessing the extent to which the scheme can be said to contribute to resilience to climate change, based on its effectiveness as a safety net and driver of household accumulation, its ability to create assets which build collective resilience, and its support for transformations of exploitative social relations. The article concludes that the MGNREGA has already made a major contribution to resilience, but requires improvements in governance and state capacity to maximize its contribution. © The Authors 2017.

AB  - Contract farming (CF), an institutional innovation, can reduce transaction costs and solve market imperfections in many developing countries. This study compares productivity and technical efficiency (TE) of contract and independent producers of high yielding variety (HYV) paddy seed (a low-value crop) and ginger (a high-value crop) producers in a sample of smallholders in Nepal. We address the self-selection into CF by using propensity score matching and translog stochastic frontier function to estimate our empirical model. Using farm-level data from Nepal, our findings show that CF increased the average TE levels of HYV paddy seed producers from 87% to 94% and the average TE levels of ginger producers from 89% to 97%. Finally, we find that human capital and distance to the market increases the technical inefficiency of low-value crop smallholders in Nepal.

AB  - Using both household level and plot-level data from Northern Bangladesh, this paper analyzes the difference in agricultural productivity across different contractual arrangements among ultra-poor households. Employing the fixed-effect model on the pseudo panel data, the paper finds evidence of sub-optimal use of inputs and, consequently, lower productivity for lands cultivated under sharecropping contracts. The inefficiency on the part of sharecroppers is also evident from the stochastic frontier model. Although the paper finds that credit has no direct impact on productivity, the results of Logit estimates suggest that availability of credit induces households to opt for fixed-rental contracts. © 2017 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland

AB  - Organic agriculture can sustain rural development and ease poverty. However, whether it could be a viable pathway to improve the livelihoods of small-scale farmers in the context of urbanisation and demographic change has been less studied. To understand this, household surveys were conducted in 2007 and 2014 in Wanzai, Jiangxi Province China, where organic farming started in 2000. The results show that organic farming did contribute to higher farm incomes for small-scale farmers (< 1 ha land) compared to those practicing conventional agriculture, regardless of whether the profitability is measured on a per land unit or per household basis. The annual farmers household net income increased from 2007 to 2014, however, the farm income of small-scale farmers only makes up a minor part of total household income and its percentage becomes less and less over time. For medium-scale organic farmers (> 1 ha land), the proportion of income from farming was higher (56% in 2007 and 77% in 2014), leading to average farm incomes of USD16,108 in 2014. Among organic farmers, cooperatives members performed better economically than those not in cooperatives. Organic agriculture can ensure stable and sustainable alternative livelihoods, especially in a situation where available land offers opportunities for scaling up. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Contract farming (CF) arrangements have the potential to address market failures and improve technology adoption, productivity, and welfare. In Ghana, government and donors use CF as a strategy for increasing adoption of new agricultural technologies and developing value chains. Yet to date, there has not been a rigorous assessment of these CF schemes. The focus in this paper is on different maize-based CF schemes in the poorest and most remote region in Ghana. It assesses the profitability and potential impact of these CF schemes, utilizing a unique plot-level dataset that covers two periods of data and two maize plots (scheme and non-scheme) per household, and employing matching techniques and an instrumental variable approach to address selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity across farmers. These are complemented by a community-level survey, in-depth interviews with scheme operators, and a series of key informant interviews. Results show that these schemes led to improved technology adoption and yield increases. In addition, a subset of maize farmers with high yield improvements due to CF participation have high profits. Maize CF schemes also enabled market coordination and consistent supply of quality maize to downstream industries. However, on average, the impact of the CF schemes on profitability is negative, even when input diversion is accounted for. Yield increases are not high enough to compensate for higher input requirements and the cost of capital under the schemes. Despite higher yields, the costs to produce one metric tonne of maize under CF schemes are higher than on maize farms without CF schemes, twice that of several countries in Africa, and more than seven times higher than that of major maize-exporting countries (the United States, Brazil, and Argentina). Sustainability of these CF schemes will largely depend on developing and promoting much-improved varieties and technologies that boost yields in order to compensate for the high input and credit costs. © 2017 The Author(s)

AB  - Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important food security crop or resource for poor rural communities particularly in Africa. The crop’s ability to produce high yields even under poor conditions and storability of its roots underground for longer periods or until needed makes it a model ‘food security crop’. In Benin Republic, cassava has been recognized as one of the major crop contributing towards dynamic value chains generating incomes for small-holder farmers. The crop is grown all over the country, however, the increased production are mainly recorded from far south and central parts of the country. Genetic improvement of cassava in Benin Republic is limited because of poor knowledge of genetic diversity present within the country. The main objective of this study was to assess the genetic diversity and relationships among elite cassava varieties collected from different regions of Benin using fluorescently labelled simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and to compare the results with farmer’s knowledge and morphological traits. A total of 96 cultivars collected from major cassava growing areas such as Southern and Central Benin were classified into 24 different groups using farmers’ knowledge, while classification based on 18 morphological traits resulted in five groups. In total, sixteen SSR markers were tested for molecular analysis of the ninety-six cassava varieties. Among the sixteen, twelve SSR markers gave good banding pattern and were used to genotype the varieties. An average of 3.58 and 0.47 for number of alleles and polymorphism information content respectively was observed. The observed heterozygosity (Ho) ranged from 0.23 to 1.0 with an average of 0.66 indicating moderate level of diversity among the cultivars. Based on the proportion of shared alleles and hierarchical clustering, the 96 elite cassava varieties were classified as 74 unique varieties. Principal component analysis and analysis of molecular variance revealed no significant variation between the regions thus, explaining regular exchange of planting materials among cassava farmers across various regions. The moderate level of genetic diversity in famer’s field, revealed in the present study, is a good indication of the need for broadening the genetic base of cassava in Benin Republic and establishing a formal breeding program in the country. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Value chain development (VCD) initiatives within the horticultural and organic sectors in Africa are promising strategies to improve smallholder welfare. Contracting institutional arrangements are a common feature of VCD initiatives and are increasing in number in sub-Saharan Africa as a way to source organic products from smallholder producers. The objective of this study is to better understand men and women's participation in spice producing households that sell under contract and in conventional market chains in the East Usambaras, Tanzania. We draw on New Institutional Economics, political economy and the value chain analysis framework to assess the potential role of contracting to promote gender equity among smallholder organic horticultural producers. We describe intra-household decision making over resources and marketing, access to benefits of contracting, and labor distribution between men and women in contracting and non-contracting households. We then extend the gender analysis to evaluate the role of gender in contracting and conventional value chains operating within the community and district. Using a cross-sectional research design and data collected through 13 focus group discussions, 54 personal interviews and 156 household questionnaires, we show that contracting reduces transaction costs in the chain compared with the conventional trade. However, norms in the wider political economic context give rise to gendered patterns of participation in both household and chain activities in contracting and non-contracting households. Our findings suggest that contracting does not provide significant opportunities for women in married households to participate and benefit based on limited participation in decision-making and access to trainings. Divorced women and widows gain access to contract employment opportunities to earn income. This study highlights the importance of understanding gender relations in the household and community to guide the development of gender equitable VCD initiatives and contracting approaches.

AB  - Rice is a staple food for over half the global population and is mostly produced by smallholders. Rice cultivation at global level is responsible for over 10% of global agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and about 1.3%–1.8% of the anthropogenic GHG emissions. Taking time series data from the World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organisation, International Rice Research Institute and United States Department of Agriculture, this study aims to compare the trends and magnitudes of rice yield, per capita rice consumption and its relationships with per capita income and life expectancy, as well as CH4 and N2O emissions from rice farming among the eight different countries (China, India, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Indonesia) which, collectively, account for about 82.05% of the global rice production and 78.23% of the global rice consumption. Moreover, agricultural practices as a whole in these eight countries is responsible for 35% of global agricultural emissions. Over the 54 year period of study from 1961 to 2014, rice yield increased significantly in all countries; however, the current pace is not sufficient to meet the increasing demands. Similarly, results suggest that the generalisation of rice consumption behaviour—as normal or inferior goods—is misleading and is largely influenced by the culture, norms, values and beliefs of a given country. Although the absolute amounts of GHG emissions from rice cultivation has increased in all countries during the study period, the corresponding emission intensities have declined sharply, mainly due to the rapid increase in yield. Among the eight countries, China and Vietnam's performance was better in terms of their increased yield, decreasing rates of emissions intensity and a lower water footprint whilst Thailand's performance was poorest. The differences between the different countries and practices which enable more rice to be produced with less water, energy and land are also discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is an increasing recognition of the role of climate change adaptation among smallholder farmers in rain-fed agriculture in Africa. Collective action among smallholder farmers has been suggested as influencing local adaptation processes hence the need to evaluate its impact in different contexts. This paper provides evidence of collective action in enhancing local adaptation to climate variability. It determines the importance of different forms of collective action for enhancing adaptation. Through simple random sampling, a survey of 240 households in Embu County in Kenya and 200 households from Kapchorwa district of Uganda was undertaken. Focus-group discussions involving farmer groups and local government representatives were performed to triangulate information collected through the surveys. The results show a positive relationship between membership in farmer groups and adaptation to climate variability in both sites. Four main components of collective action were identified in Embu and these included the development of internal group capacities, assets mobilization and management, collective marketing, and management of human and natural capital. In Kapchorwa, the development of internal group capacities, risk spreading, and financial resources were significant. We argue that local-level governance and institutional arrangements for collective action are critical for successful adaptation to climate variability. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Even though both empirical and field evidence hail integrated pest management (IPM) as promising techniques for cost-effective and environment friendly control of agricultural pests, coffee farmers still rely on pesticides. A post coffee stem borer IPM training survey of 126 farmers reveals that farmers’ attitudes toward pesticides is a major constraint to IPM use. Farmers perceived that pesticide use simplifies pest management, produces higher yields and good quality coffee appealing to the buyers. On this basis, they mainly used pesticides compared to IPM practices for Coffee Stem Borer (CSB) pest management. Second, the CSB IPM practices are less appealing because of the high labor requirements and costly nature and therefore a constraint especially to women and the elderly. Consequently, increasing IPM practices uptake requires a deliberate and collective effort of key coffee sector stakeholders to design and implement educational programs aimed at judicious application of pesticides. After that, a continuous testing of more IPM techniques coupled with encouraging farmers to adapt and make modifications on the current practices can potentially reduce pesticide use. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Performance is a useful lens through which to analyze agrarian life, as performance illuminates the ways that farmers manage the complex socioecological demands of farm work while participating in social life and in the larger political economy. The dialectic of planning and improvisation in the farm field has produced scholarship at multiple scales of political ecology, including the global ramifications of new technologies or policies, as well as the hyper-local engagements between farmers and fields in the context of modernity and development. Political ecologists are also beginning to understand how affects, such as aspirations and frustrations, influence agriculture by structuring how farmers and other stakeholders make decisions about farms, households, capital, and environments. To understand farm work as a performance is to situate it within particular stages, roles, scripts, and audiences at different scales. The articles in this Special Section ask how farmers have improvised, planned, and performed in response to agroecological challenges, bridging scholarship in political ecology, development studies, and the study of agrarian landscapes through new empirical case studies and theoretical contributions. Agriculture both signals social values and fosters improvisations within farming communities' collective vulnerability to weather and the political economy. We argue that the lens of performance situates the political ecology of agriculture within the constraints of the political economy, the aspirations and frustrations of daily life, and the dialectic between improvised responses to change and planning in the field. © 2018 Journal of Political Ecology.
La performance est une lentille utile à travers laquelle analyser la vie agraire, car la performance éclaire la manière dont les agriculteurs gèrent les exigences socio-écologiques complexes du travail agricole, tout en participant à la vie sociale et à l'économie politique au sens large. La dialectique de la planification et de l'improvisation dans le domaine agricole a produit des connaissances à de multiples échelles de l'écologie politique, y compris les ramifications mondiales des nouvelles technologies ou politiques, ainsi que les engagements hyper-locaux entre les agriculteurs et leurs champs. Les écologistes politiques commencent également à comprendre comment les influences, telles que les aspirations et les frustrations, influencent l'agriculture en structurant la façon dont les agriculteurs et les autres parties prenantes prennent des décisions concernant les fermes, les ménages, le capital et l'environnement. Comprendre le travail agricole comme une performance signifie le situer dans des étapes, rôles, scripts et publics particuliers à différentes échelles. Les articles de cette section spéciale demandent comment les agriculteurs ont improvisé, planifié et exécuté en réponse aux défis agroécologiques. Ils établissent un lien entre l'érudition en écologie politique, les études sur le développement et l'étude des paysages agraires par le biais de nouvelles études de cas empiriques et de contributions théoriques. L'agriculture signale des valeurs sociales et favorise les improvisations au sein de la vulnérabilité collective des communautés agricoles face aux conditions météorologiques et à l'économie politique. Nous soutenons que la lentille de la performance situe l'écologie politique de l'agriculture dans les contraintes de l'économie politique, les aspirations et les frustrations de la vie quotidienne et la dialectique entre les réponses improvisées au changement et la planification sur le terrain. © 2018 Journal of Political Ecology.
El performance es un lente útil a través del cual se puede analizar la vida agraria, al ilustrar las formas en que los campesinos resuelven las complejas demandas socioecológicas del trabajo en el campo, mientras participan en la vida social y en una más amplia economía política. La dialéctica de la planeación e improvisación en el campo del cultivo, ha producido estudios en ecología política a varias escalas, incluyendo las ramificaciones de nuevas tecnologías o políticas, así como en la participaciones hiperlocales entre campesinos y los campos en el contexto de la modernidad y el desarrollo. Interesados en ecología política están comenzando a entender cómo sentimientos, tales como aspiraciones y frustraciones, influyen en la agricultura al estructurar cómo los agricultores y otros actores, toman decisiones sobre granjas, hogares, capital y entornos. Entender el trabajo agrícola como performance, requiere situarlo dentro de etapas, labores, textos y audiencias particulares a diferentes escalas. Los artículos en esta sección especial cuestionan cómo los agricultores han improvisado, planeado y actuado en respuesta a los retos agroecológicos, vinculando estudios en ecología política, estudios de desarrollo, y el estudio de los paisajes agrarios a través de nuevos casos de estudio empírico y contribuciones teóricas. La agricultura indica valores sociales y fomenta improvisaciones en el marco de la vulnerabilidad colectiva al clima y la economía política en comunidades agrícolas. Aquí discutimos que el lente del performance sitúa a la ecología política de la agricultura dentro de los límites de la economía política, las aspiraciones y frustraciones de la vida cotidiana, y la dialéctica entre las respuestas que se improvisan ante el cambio y la planeación en el campo. © 2018 Journal of Political Ecology.

AB  - This study aimed to analyse the extent to which land- and water-use rights enable/deter the productive use of irrigation water. Data was collected from 242 sampled smallholders in three study areas in KwaZulu-Natal. The findings indicate that the productive use of irrigation water is positively influenced by land- and water-use rights, with scheme committees being the first point of contact for smallholders when they need access to land and water. A provincial body of scheme committees is needed through which smallholders can capacitate each other in how they can improve access, appreciate the role of collective action and deal with challenges related to water, land and markets by applying their experiences. This body can be represented in policy formulation and aid in policy implementation. This paper shows that land and water policy alone cannot improve smallholder productivity, and that enhancing the productive use of irrigation water requires a holistic approach that considers the accessibility of input and output markets. © 2018, African Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics.

AB  - The main focus of most programmes in developing countries carried out by NGOs is to develop small-scale farmers’ capacities. One approach hereby is to use multi-stakeholder innovation systems, such as the ‘Nicaraguan Learning Al-liance’ (NLA). However, tools for the evaluation of multi-stakeholder innovation systems are rare. This paper reports on the implementation of a conceptual framework to carry out an impact evaluation of multi-stakeholder innovation systems using the NLA as the object of study. The assessment focused on the business relationship constructs of trust and capacity development. Survey interviews, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions collected data from agribusiness stakeholders linked with the NLA and from a control group of stakeholders involved with other networks. The quantitative data were analysed through factor and regression analyses. Results from the quantitative analyses were triangulated with qualitative data. The analysis shows that the NLA has been successful in developing smallholder farmers’ capacities as a result of trust developed through its dedicated project managers. Nonetheless, the NLA has not been more successful at developing agribusiness capacities among Nicaraguan farmers than other networks with the same goals. Results from this study point to the need for facilitating more interactions between the different networks of farmers’ cooperatives and organisations with other stakeholders already active within the Nicaraguan agrifood innovation system. © 2018, Kassel University Press GmbH.

AB  - Irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is expanding, following years of neglect. Governments, international donors and private sector actors have renewed their interest in irrigation investments to make the region food and water secure by moving from drought-prone, rain-fed agriculture to irrigated agriculture. Until now, public investments have emphasized decentralized water management systems and the establishment of Water User Associations (WUAs) as the most prominent management approach to accompany the expansion of irrigation. Investors expect WUAs to deliver on user participation, full cost recovery and reliable service provision. However, implementation of WUAs is fraught with problems and hurdles, be it internally (pertaining to the community of irrigators and users) or externally, affected by specific political economies, ineffective policies, and rigid water bureaucracies. Building on existing literature and the analysis of a portfolio of development projects (past and under implementation), this paper reviews the evolution of WUAs in SSA, reflecting on the conceptualization of how they operate, and the promised outcomes related to irrigation development and the efficient and effective delivery of irrigation services. It also moves one step further from the existing plethora of studies on WUAs, postulating that additional reflection is needed to understand the limitations of WUAs and propose alternative, viable and context-based adapted models. This need is particularly strong in SSA where irrigation is incipient, and governments and donors are still consolidating their development approaches. Whereas a growing body of international literature takes into account the sociopolitical context of decentralized irrigation management, practical indication on what remains to be done to address the various limitations found in SSA stays meagre and scattered. The objective of this paper is not to challenge the myth of WUAs but to learn how to better deliver on the promised outcomes. The underlying message is that, if the SSA region is to be made water and food secure while respecting resource sustainability, community development, livelihoods and equality of resource access, the recurrent templates for WUA management and governance need to be revisited and adapted to local needs. In order to do so, this paper examines the main lines of thought on WUAs, defining a mainstream type of WUA and then proceeding to evaluate the main consequences for irrigation management in SSA brought about by its implementation. To that effect, this paper has developed a framework to analyze how WUAs function, centered around two main interdependent narratives underpinning the mainstream WUA approach: (i) full cost recovery of operation and maintenance (O & M) for system performance, and (ii) user participation in decision making at the WUA level. The juxtaposition of such a theoretical approach with the reality on the ground when it comes to the actual delivery of services by WUAs represents the next level of analysis included in this report. Here, the paper highlights how the complexities arising from the expected feedback loop generated by WUAs (irrigation performance - agricultural productivity - cost recovery - user participation) are extremely difficult to predict and prove due to the myriad of factors affecting irrigation management and agricultural productivity. Following this, an additional analytical framework is proposed to characterize WUAs in its socio-technical and economic context, and to systematically analyze conditions under which WUAs would function in SSA. The framework provides a broad overview of WUAs in SSA, considering the socioeconomic and political setting of WUAs, the water resources system they manage, their governance structure and finally the type of users/members. This framework is used to study cases drawn from project reports and peer-reviewed literature mainly from the following countries: Senegal, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Niger, Mali, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Malawi, Zimbabwe and South Africa. The review of these case studies highlights that the compounded complexities of WUAs in SSA not only prevent the achievement of improved agricultural productivity, but weaken the assumed feedback loop through which improved irrigation performance strengthens cost recovery and user participation in WUAs. In turn, donors and public agencies conclude that WUAs, and often the irrigation projects, have failed. As a result, policy makers and donor agencies have tried five main channels to strengthen conventional WUAs: (i) WUA policy and legal instruments, (ii) WUA bylaws, (iii) contracts with WUAs, (iv) training of WUA members, and (v) introducing monitoring and evaluation (M & E). All five channels are reviewed in this paper, concluding that the advancement of WUA policies, bylaws, contracts, trainings and M & E signals that even though donors and public agencies recognize the weaknesses of WUA management, it does not represent meaningful change in expectations from WUAs or a substantive change in the approach to irrigation scheme management. No evidence has been found to show that having national-level legal instruments or regulations, or ensuring that WUAs create bylaws, actually leads to the desired outcomes of improved cost recovery, equitable participation, and improved overall effectiveness of governance or O & M in an irrigation scheme. Against this backdrop, this paper introduces seven alternative management options which deviate from the way WUAs are typically implemented and expected to function by water administrations, decision makers and donors. None of the options have been widely adopted so far; however, the first five alternative management options have been explicitly advocated by scholars and development organizations. A definition of alternative management options and an overview of the seven options are provided. The paper then explains each option in more detail with a specific emphasis on how the approach deviates and/or overlaps with the way WUAs are typically conceptualized and implemented. The alternative management options reviewed here shift the focus onto activities that are related to other actors and/or processes in irrigation management. WUAs may still play an important role in these alternative management options, but formalizing and training WUAs per se is no longer considered the only way to achieve cost recovery and user participation. In some options, the role and responsibility of WUAs may even be completely different from mainstream practices. Examples of its practice in SSA or other development contexts are also discussed. Finally, the most important opportunities and threats which may affect the implementation of this management option in the SSA context are outlined. This paper then concludes by reflecting on how the general expectations of WUAs from water bureaucracies, decision makers and donors to deliver on cost recovery, user participation and, ultimately, irrigation performance are rarely met. One reason is that cost recovery through water user fees is often prioritized over user participation in decision making. Indeed, user participation is seen as a fundamental factor to ensure willingness of users to pay fees and undertake O & M. The underlying issue is the invalid assumptions that underpin the expected functions of WUAs (examined here). The review of case studies highlights that the socioeconomic context and agricultural conditions shape the ability of WUAs to deliver results, but these enabling conditions cannot be easily created by external institutions and actors. In SSA, WUAs are primarily promoted in a setting of smallholder agriculture by external agencies, such as national governments or donors, with a few notable exceptions. To summarize, the main challenges that appear to constrain WUA management in SSA include the following: 1. WUAs are unable to collect user fees and therefore unable to pay for O & M. Scheme or project goals may not prioritize and undertake activities to support increased farmer income. 2. Farmers' incentives may not support payment of user fees; income from irrigated agriculture is low and contributes only partially to their livelihood strategies. 3. WUAs are not inclusive of different types of water users, including women, although, by default, the irrigation infrastructure is usually used for multiple purposes. WUA membership is biased towards irrigators (plot owners or managers). 4. Emerging irrigation, such as individual pump users, are not integrated into scheme planning or management. Individual irrigators encroach upon gravity irrigation systems managed by WUAs, but do not participate in WUA decision making, cost recovery or O & M. 5. Local institutions (customary, political, state) have contradictory objectives and incentives than formal water user institutions that are often externally imposed. 6. Low capacities of the state in rural areas limit technical and management assistance to consistently support WUA development. The results of this study suggest the following key lessons in relation to irrigation WUAs: 1. Setting up WUA policies, bylaws, contracts, trainings and M & E constitute limited means to improve the performance of WUAs. 2. No simple alternative management arrangement exists within the existing WUA framework. 3. Adapt management roles, structures and infrastructure to deliver transformative services and improve rural livelihoods. 4. User participation is crucial for smallholder irrigation development, but does not mean that WUAs can or should be solely responsible for all the functions. 5. Performance indicators and the practice of M & E of WUAs are largely missing. © 2012, by IWMI.

AB  - The cacao belongs to most important agricultural crops worldwide, in recent decades facing increasing demand as well as falling production capacity. The dramatically fall of production of cacao in Mexican agriculture, where it was first domesticated, is becoming a serious concern for diversity of local production, as local producers are substituting cacao plantations with more rentable crops thus giving away a rich genetic as well as agricultural legacy that could under adequate conditions provide a source of income for large region while maintaining the natural diversity. The paper tries to find the answer in studying the social capital of cacao producers of Tabasco region, coming to the conclusion that it is collective action and social capital led production set of practices that is crucial for the re-installment and prosperity of the plantations, rather than a single motive such as the recent invasion of Moniliophthora roreri fungus. © 2018, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo.

Using consumption per adult equivalent as a wellbeing indicator, we measured the impact of agricultural cooperative membership by implementing propensity score matching and endogenous switching regression estimation techniques. Both estimation methods indicate that joining agricultural cooperatives has a positive impact on the wellbeing of smallholder farmers. Furthermore, the analysis also indicates that agricultural cooperative membership has a heterogeneous impact on wellbeing among its members. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - During the past two decades, food assistance policy has shifted toward local or regional food purchases and away from purchases from donor countries. Although most local and regional procurement occurs through hard tendering processes open to large-scale firms and farms, there is growing interest in identifying how and whether to procure from smallholder farmer organizations (FOs). To date, little is known about the drivers of successful contracting with FOs. We utilize data from the United Nations World Food Programme Purchase for Progress pilot in three East African countries to predict defaults on contracts. We examine four possible explanations: country contexts, FO characteristics, prior experience with contracts, and contract modalities and their relationship to local spot market prices. The single most important predictor of default is the increase in market prices between contract approval and delivery. Yet, although increases in market prices are linked to increases in default, this relationship is decreasing in contract size, indicating search costs associated with breaking contracts. Our findings yield both generalizable and context-specific insights about whether—and when—procuring from smallholder farmers can be successfully integrated into the food assistance toolkit. © 2017 International Association of Agricultural Economists

AB  - In the aftermath of the market liberalization reforms, interventions in developing countries shifted toward building institutions. One of such interventions is the introduction of commodity exchanges. The theoretical justification is that commoditization reduces the high transaction costs associated with the information and enforcement problems characterizing agricultural markets of these countries. However it is not known whether these potential gains are transmitted to the various markets along a value chain. By taking the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX) as a case, this paper examines the impacts of the introduction of the commodity exchange in transmitting price signals along the coffee value chain (world-export-auction-producer prices). We found that both the speed and symmetry of transmission remains weak even after the launch of ECX. At each level, the market chain was found to favor buyers. This implies that not only the country's gains from export are sub-optimal, the cumulative burden is on the millions of smallholder farmers who are located at the bottom of the chain. In a context where local agricultural markets remain traditional and export markets barely competitive, the introduction of the commodity exchange will have limited impacts in improving the performance of markets in transmitting price signals. Other policy measures to further liberalize both local and export markets are required. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background The preservation of the economic livelihood of tobacco farmers is a common argument used to oppose tobacco control measures. However, little empirical evidence exists about these livelihoods. We seek to evaluate the economic livelihoods of individual tobacco farmers in Malawi, including how much money they earn from selling tobacco, and the costs they incur to produce the crop, including labour inputs. We also evaluate farmers’ decisions to contract directly with firms that buy their crops. Methods We designed and implemented an economic survey of 685 tobacco farmers, including both independent and contract farmers, across the 6 main tobacco-growing districts. We augmented the survey with focus group discussions with subsets of respondents from each region to refine our inquiries. Results Contract farmers cultivating tobacco in Malawi as their main economic livelihoods are typically operating at margins that place their households well below national poverty thresholds, while independent farmers are typically operating at a loss. Even when labour is excluded from the calculation of income less costs, farmers’ gross margins place most households in the bottom income decile of the overall population. Tobacco farmers appear to contract principally as a means to obtain credit, which is consistently reported to be difficult to obtain. Conclusions The tobacco industry narrative that tobacco farming is a lucrative economic endeavour for smallholder farmers is demonstrably inaccurate in the context of Malawi. From the perspective of these farmers, tobacco farming is an economically challenging livelihood for most. © 2017, BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This study uses data from a sample of 150 oilseed farming households from Arsi Robe, Ethiopia, to assess the impact of different knowledge bases (education, training and experience) and their interactions on linseed productivity. Methodology: A multiple regression analysis was employed to assess the combined effect of the knowledge bases, factors such as age of the household head, land size, marketing channels and geophysical factors (such as land slope) on linseed productivity. Findings: The findings reveal no differences in productivity between trained and untrained farmers. They further show that training and the interaction between training and experience positively influence productivity. Our findings, however, reveal farmer education to have an inverse yet insignificant effect on productivity. Furthermore, we found that factors such as the slope of the land and the choice of marketing channel also play an important role in influencing productivity. Practical implications: Moving away from the traditional top-down approach could be the answer to avoid a mismatch between the information given by trainers and what the farmers actually need. Theoretical implications: The study used interaction variables of knowledge bases, and attempted to demonstrate the importance of a tacit knowledge base, which is often not well documented and therefore neglected in research. Originality/value: The research demonstrates the combined effects that interactions between several knowledge bases have on the productivity of linseed farmers. © 2017 Wageningen University.

AB  - Large-scale agricultural investments (LSAIs) in general and their socio-economic implications in particular have been heavily debated in recent years. While some claim that LSAIs are an important catalyst for development in neglected rural areas, others caution that they pose a risk to rural communities’ livelihoods. The extent to which LSAIs provide benefits for local communities is hence still contested. This paper sets out to conceptually understand what effects the establishment of a large-scale farm has on the rural labor market in low- and middle-income countries. In addition, we empirically address the question of whether large-scale farming as recorded in the Land Matrix creates or destroys employment. We develop a transition matrix to identify several scenarios based on key determinants of the direct employment creation potential of LSAIs, namely the former land use, the crop type and the production model. We empirically assess the actual importance of these scenarios and the employment creation to be expected from this sample of LSAIs based on labor intensities. We further look into the net employment effects for land formerly used by smallholder farmers. Our analysis shows that LSAIs massively crowd out smallholder farmers, which is only partially mitigated through the cultivation of labor intensive crops and the application of contract farming schemes. This holds true for all regions targeted by LSAIs, although regional differences are found in terms of magnitude. The paper concludes that these effects tend to be large on the local scale (i.e., in the immediate surroundings of the investment site) but small in relation to total national employment in agriculture. However, indirect employment creation related to LSAIs, which is discussed but not empirically addressed in this paper, needs to be taken into account to have the full picture. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Productivity barriers and opportunities influencing smallholder irrigation sustainability in Zimbabwe were identified using case studies of the Silalatshani and Mkoba irrigation schemes. The major barriers were poor infrastructure and soil fertility, and poor access to farm inputs, farm implements, functioning markets and agricultural knowledge, which resulted in low yields, food insecurity and negative farm income. Most irrigated land remains unused, and marketing of produce is uncoordinated. Mobile technologies provide opportunities for market information dissemination. Institutions are needed to continuously encourage dialogue among agricultural value chain stakeholders to allow irrigators to align their operations to market demands and improve the viability of irrigation systems. © 2016, © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - In recent decades, China undertook a series of agricultural land tenure reforms to increase the security of land use rights for rural households. While these reforms boosted agricultural production, they also increased landlessness among women due to patrilocal and patrilineal customs. Utilising data from China’s Women Social Status Survey conducted in 2010, this paper examines the impact of women’s land rights on the incidence of domestic violence in rural China. The results show that women who have lost claims to contract land or have no residential land face significantly higher risks of being physically or psychologically abused by their husbands. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - We investigate the unique contractual arrangement between a large Ethiopian sugar factory and its adjacent outgrower associations. The only significant difference between the sugarcane production on the factory-operated sugarcane plantation and on the outgrower-operated plots is the remuneration system and thus, the incentives to the workers. We compare the productivity of these two production schemes using a cross-sectional plot-level data set. As sugarcane production depends on various exogenous factors that are measured as categorical variables (e.g., soil type, cane variety, etc.), we estimate the production function by a nonparametric kernel regression method that takes into account both continuous and categorical explanatory variables without assuming a functional form and without imposing restrictions on interactions between the explanatory variables. Our results show that outgrower-operated plots have—ceteris paribus—a statistically and economically significantly higher productivity than factory-operated plots, which can be explained by outgrowers having stronger incentives to put more effort into their work than the employees of the sugar factory. © 2017 International Association of Agricultural Economists

AB  - The intensification of beef cattle production in dryland areas of East Indonesia has the potential to substantially raise the incomes of smallholder farmers that dominate the sector. In this study we assess the potential for intensifying beef production on Sumbawa Island, by introducing a household feedlot production system (2–20 animals) based on the Leucaena leucocephala (leucanea) tree legume as an improved source of feed. We used a system dynamics approach to model the entire value chain, accounting for herd dynamics, demand dynamics and seasonality. Our findings complement the growing body of biophysical evidence about the potential success of this intervention, by simulating improvements in the annual profitability for beef farmers in the project area of up to 415% by 2023. Increases in farm profit were shown to depend near equally on the higher productivity of the leucaena feeding system and an associated price premium, demonstrating the importance of supporting improved agricultural production with better marketing practices. The intervention was also shown to generate positive or neutral benefits for the main post-farm value chain actors. Importantly, it also reduced the GHG emission intensity of outputs from the beef herd by 16% by 2020. We explored number of scale-out pathways, including a relatively moderate pace of autonomous adoption for our main analysis, resulting in the accumulation of 3,444 hectares of leucaena 20-years after the initial project phase, which could sustain the fattening of 37,124 male cattle per year. More ambitious rates of scale-out were found to be possible without exceeding the animal and land resources of the island. © 2017 Dahlanuddin et al.

AB  - This paper examines the impacts of access to extension services and cooperative membership on technology adoption, asset ownership and poverty using household-level data from rural Nigeria. Using different matching techniques and endogenous switching regression approach, we find that both extension access and cooperative membership have a positive and statistically significant effect on technology adoption and household welfare. Moreover, we find that both extension access and cooperative membership have heterogeneous impacts. In particular, we find evidence of a positive selection as the average treatment effects of extension access and cooperative membership are higher for farmers with the highest propensity to access extension and cooperative services. The impact of extension services on poverty reduction and of cooperatives on technology adoption is significantly stronger for smallholders with access to formal credit than for those without access. This implies that expanding rural financial markets can maximize the potential positive impacts of extension and cooperative services on farmers’ productivity and welfare. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - This paper analyses the link between gender differences and different activities along the cowpea value chain as well as food security and asset-based poverty using a recent cross-sectional data set of over 120 farm households in Eastern Zambia. We used the endogenous switching probit regression model to account for both observed and unobserved heterogeneity. Results show that women’s participation in the cowpea value chain significantly increases cowpea production, marketing and adoption of improved cowpea varieties. It also reduces both food insecurity and poverty. However, women’s participation in the value chain is limited by low levels of education, access to extension, credit, village markets, and improved agricultural technologies. Policies to address these constraints that limit women’s participation in the cowpea value chain have the potential to reduce gender disparities, food insecurity, and poverty. © 2017 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.

AB  - This conceptual paper discusses the challenges smallholder producer cooperatives in developing countries face while trying to access agricultural global value chains. We assess the problem of competitiveness related to lack of commitment and improper selection. Prioritization of open membership over selection is generally taken for granted in the policy debate on farmers’ market organizations (FMOs). We argue that open membership may work in community-driven organizations, however, it becomes a major threat for entrepreneurial FMOs. Inclusion facilitates free riding, which forms a barrier for investments of members. This is one of the major reasons why so many of these organizations are so much resource constrained, i.e. are not able to compete in the market without external support. FMOs should take targeting and selection serious if entrepreneurial activities are intended. Otherwise, they miss the opportunity to create a committed member base willing to invest in a potentially competitive organization. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper, we analyze the impact of smallholder participation in a contract-farming scheme in the rice sector in Benin. We use data from a cross-sectional farm-household survey and different propensity score matching estimations to reveal how participation in a contract-farming scheme affects smallholder rice production. We find that contract-farming results in expansion of the rice area, intensification of rice production, increased commercialization of rice, and higher farm-gate prices, and ultimately contributes to rice output growth and increased income. Our findings imply that contract-farming can contribute to upgrading the rice supply chain and the development of the rice sector in Benin. Promoting and supporting the spread of contract-farming schemes in the sector might be an effective way to contribute to reaching the government goals of expanding rice production to become self-sufficient and improving rice quality to compete with imported rice. While there is a large empirical literature on contract-farming in high-value and commodity export sectors, studies on contract-farming in staple food sectors are very scarce. Our results document that contract-farming for staple food crops can be sustainable and benefit smallholder farmers; which is against theoretical expectations that contracting for staple food crops is not feasible because of contract-enforcement problems that stem from a low value of produce, low storage and transport costs, and a larger number of buyers in the chain. Our study contributes to understanding the role that contract-farming might play in the much needed upgrading of domestic and staple food crop sectors in developing countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the mid-1990s, fairtrade-organic registration data showed that only 9 % of Oaxaca, Mexico’s organic coffee ‘farm operators’ were women; by 2013 the female farmer rate had increased to 42 %. Our research investigates the impact of this significant increase in women’s coffee association participation among 210 members of two coffee producer associations in Oaxaca, Mexico. We find that female coffee organization members report high levels of household decision-making power and they are more likely than their male counterparts to report control over their coffee income. These significant advances in women’s agency within the household are offset by the fact that the women experience significant time poverty as they engage in coffee production while bearing a disproportionate share of domestic labor obligations. The women coffee producers view organizational labor as a third burden on their time, after their reproductive and productive labor. The time poverty they experience limits their ability to fully participate in coffee organizational governance and consequently there are few women leaders at all levels of the coffee producer businesses. This is problematic because it limits women’s ability to fully benefit from organizational membership: when women fully participate in governance they gain valuable business and leadership skills and producer associations with active female members may also be more likely to develop and maintain programs and policies that enhance gender equity. Our findings indicate that targeted agricultural development programs to improve gender equity among agricultural smallholders should involve creative ways to ease women’s labor burdens and reduce their time poverty in order to facilitate full organizational participation. The research findings fill a gap in existing studies of agricultural global value chains (GVCs) by demonstrating how the certified coffee GVC depends on women’s under and un-paid labor not only within the household but also within producer organizations. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Recurrent food insecurity in the highlands of Central America has been exacerbated by the recent convergence of a coffee leaf rust outbreak that began defoliating crops in 2011 and a drought that started in 2014. In the context of these multiple challenges, this paper explores how seasonal hunger is related to smallholder organizational affiliation, farm and farmer characteristics, and post-hazard household-level coping strategies. The study integrates qualitative research, hydro-climatic data analysis, and a survey of 368 households completed in 2014. A number of household capacities correlate significantly with shorter periods of seasonal hunger: households with larger farms, with off-farm employment, and that produce more than half of their food, maintain more fruit trees, and harvest more coffee reported fewer lean months. We find evidence consistent with path dependence in how households cope with a sequence of environmental hazards, as the reported use of less preferred coping responses to past events (e.g., Hurricane Mitch and the 2009 drought) tended to correlate with their continued use after subsequent hazards. A comparison of coping responses of households affiliated with a farmer-to-farmer institution promoting subsistence-oriented production with those affiliated with cooperatives prioritizing sustainable coffee exports shows that farmer institutions were not strongly correlated with the number of lean months or coping mechanisms. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - This article examines how Payments for Environmental Services (PES) influence household land-use behavior in the context of common-property lands. PES programs have been increasingly applied to communities who collectively manage their lands. While a number of authors have expressed concerns about the ability of said programs to generate additional environmental benefits and the potential for PES to counter community resource management arrangements, few empirical studies have explicitly examined PES in the context of communal resource management. Here, we take advantage of the gradual rollout of an Ecuadorian PES program to compare land-use behavior on collective lands in participant communities to households in communities that are waiting to participate. The goals of the analysis are to (a) identify if the PES program has produced changes in land-use, (b) assess the degree to which household characteristics and communal governance conditions drive land-use behavior, and (c) explore the interplay between PES and communal resource management institutions. Data were gathered from a cross-sectional survey of 399 households located in 11 communities. We use difference-in-differences to estimate the average effect of PES program participation on household behavior. Logit models, coupled with qualitative analysis, unpack how communal governance characteristics influence land-use behavior and the interplay between communal governance conditions and PES. We find that PES reduced the number of households grazing livestock on collective lands by 12%, however, household and communal governance factors are also instrumental in determining land-use decisions. Our results provide empirical insights into the debate over PES in collective resource management and illustrate how PES and communal resource management institutions can build upon each other to attain desired household conservation behavior. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Our research examines the benefits and drawbacks for cooperatives who participate in voluntary coffee certifications. We interviewed administrators at twenty Costa Rican coffee cooperatives about management practices related to voluntary certification. Voluntary certifications are popular among coffee cooperatives. Access to certified markets is facilitated by state support of the cooperative sector, regulation of the coffee sector and well-enforced environmental and social laws. However, there are no significant or consistent financial incentives for farmers to pursue certification. Multiple certifications may lower auditing and implementation costs, but cooperatives rarely receive the full premium for multiply-certified coffee. Low market demand for certified coffee, weak price incentives and high auditing and management costs encourage cooperatives to certify only a portion of their members. This strategy rewards compliant farmers rather than inducing widespread change to farming practices among the entire membership. Though financial incentives are weak, certifications offer non-financial benefits to both farmers and cooperatives, including better management and more resilient cooperatives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Forestland tenure and financial incentives are the most important policy issue to sustainable forest resource management. The new wave of reform of collective forestland tenure (NRCFT) has been launched since 2003 and the governmental matching reform measures (MRMs) for the NRCFT have been introduced since 2009. The objective of these reforms is to enhance sustainable forest resource management in Chinese collective regions by encouraging rural households’ productive forest inputs. We use a unique dataset of 1778 sample households in 18 counties of nine provinces with six years and employ a fixed effects model with clustered standard errors. Our empirical results indicate that: 1) the NRCFT has increased households’ forestland area of different tenure types, and the effects of the MRMs on rural households’ labor input and production expenditures for forestry purposes are generally positive, especially household used forestland as collateral for a loan and afforestation or reafforestation subsidy and reform of Annual Allowance Cut (AAC) have significantly contributed to increase in the use of productive forest inputs; 2) the NRCFT and the MRMs have different impacts on the use of productive forest inputs for different tenure forests, and these reforms have caused the most significant changes in rural households’ production decision changes for household responsibility forestland; 3) both the NRCFT and the MRMs have significant effects on rural households’ rent-in and rent-out forestland; and 4) forestland fragmentations have caused additional labor and investment inputs for rural households’ forest resource management and protection. And finally, market drivers and household and village characteristics factors also affect households’ decisions for productive inputs for their managing forests. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Food security has been observed to be severe in northern Ghana than any other area of the country. Though this has been acknowledged, few attempts have been made to curb the situation. One of such intervention areas resides in providing policy-based evidence to guide efforts in fighting this problem. This study employs an ordered probit model using data set from the baseline survey of the USAID's Feed the Future programme in Ghana to estimate the determinants of food security in northern Ghana. We perform the analysis using a new indicator of food security-the household hunger scale. This measure is different from other household food insecurity indicators since it has been specifically developed and validated for cross-cultural use. Results: The estimates show that crop producers, multiple crop producers, yield and commercialization are key policy variables that determine food security. A key policy implication of this result is in tandem with one of the intermediate results of the Ghana Feed the Future Initiative which seeks to increase competitiveness of food value chains through increased productivity and market access. Conclusions: Based on the results, stakeholders should step up efforts to enhance productivity of farm households and provide necessary market infrastructure to boost commercialization, as these are fundamental to ensuring food security. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Contract farming (CF) agreements are presently being restructured to form part of more complex Inclusive Business (IB) set-ups. Additional instruments, alongside CF, are implemented to overcome the challenges of CF and to adapt to the policy environment in which the different stakeholders operate. This paper develops a theoretical framework that gives insight into how these complex entities are structured and operate in a developing country context. This theoretical analysis takes a holistic approach by adopting elements of existing theories to form a new critical research paradigm: (i) Resource Dependence Theory to incorporate the wider operating environment in which the two cases operate, (ii) Transaction Cost Economics to explain the internal efficiency of the different models, and (iii) Agency Theory to account for the safeguard mechanisms. This new framework is then tested on two complex IBs that aim to integrate smallholder farmers into the commercial value chain, but which have each implemented a different institutional set-up developed around CF arrangements. It finds that a high dependence by the offtaker in the first case study stimulates a higher level of commitment and investment by this stakeholder in the contract arrangement. In turn, this increases the asset specificity aspect, which then requires safeguards to ensure the smallholders adhere to the contractual agreement. A higher dependency in this particular study also resulted in a higher number of smallholders being engaged in the contract, requiring mechanisms to efficiently monitor and coordinate them. © 2017 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.

AB  - Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is an important transboundary disease in South-East Asia. Its control has been a priority in the region for at least 20 years, with extensive institutional support and capacity-building being provided by the international community through the World Organisation for Animal Health. This paper describes the FMD control and eradication programme in the Mekong region (Myanmar, Thailand, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Cambodia and Vietnam) of South-East Asia and evaluatesthe FMD control programme in one ofthe region's countries, namely Cambodia. Significant progress has been made, and the strategy for eradication is now both clearly understood and feasible in the Mekong. However, FMD control in this region requires more than just an effective vaccination strategy and regulatory support. Success will also depend on obtaining consensus and buy-in at all levels ofthe value chain, from input suppliers to consumers. Culturally and economically acceptable incentives must be in place to ensure that control measures are implemented, and those stakeholders who are expected to bear the risk and costs of control programmes must also be the main beneficiaries. The present institutional environment in the Mekong, and in particular in Cambodia, makes control and eradication of transboundary diseases difficult. Further work is required to ensure that control strategies are aligned with stakeholder needs and priorities, and actively improve smallholder welfare. Cattle producers and traders are crucial to the control of FMD in Cambodia. Economic incentives and education as well as regulation are required to ensure these stakeholders participate in this important transboundary disease eradication programme.

AB  - The role played by various institutions in the domestic agri-food systems of Caribbean nations has become an increasingly important area of research and policy attention. This paper assesses the main policies that have been implemented in Saint Lucia's agri-food system over two time periods (pre-1950 and 1950 to 2010), and analyzes their influence on formal and informal institutions. Results suggest that rule convergence in export (formal) and domestic (informal) agricultural production systems displaced informal institutions to a lower position in the institutional hierarchy. This institutional change has reduced interactions between farming community members, with negative implications for bonding and bridging social capital in the domestic food production system. Collectively, these changes have resulted in unintended outcomes associated with the decline of many rural communities. Our findings highlight the need to better identify bridging institutions in Saint Lucia's domestic agri-food sector that could help support shared rule-making, the decentralization of power and reciprocal knowledge flows amongst policy actors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - While there is a general consensus that using dairy technologies, such as improved breeds of dairy cows, can substantially increase farm productivity and income, adoption of such technologies has been generally low in developing countries. The underlying reasons for non-adoption of beneficial technologies in the dairy sector are not fully understood. In this study, we characterised adopters and non-adopters of dairy technologies in Ethiopia and Kenya based on farmers’ resources ownership in order to identify why many farmers in Ethiopia and Kenya have not adopted improved dairy technologies. As compared to non-adopters, farmers who adopt dairy technology own relatively more farm resources. The result signals that differences in resource endowments could lead to divergent technology adoption scenarios. Results show that a higher proportion of sample smallholders in Kenya have adopted dairy technologies than those in Ethiopia. Except for the use of veterinary services, fewer than 10% of sample farmers in Ethiopia have adopted dairy technologies—less than half the number of adopters in Kenya. The higher level of dairy technology adoption in Kenya can be ascribed partly to the long history of dairy development, including improvements in the value chain for the delivery of inputs, services and fluid milk marketing. Interventions that deal with the constraints related to access to farm resources and input and output markets could facilitate uptake of dairy technology in developing countries. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - In recent decades, the role of farmers’ associations in developing countries has been increasing due to a number of projects promoted by local and international governmental and non-governmental institutions and organizations. This paper analyses the effectiveness of collective action in enhancing farmers’ market performances in terms of production quantity, production quality and profit. Specifically, the study points out the role of associations in leveraging smallholder market performance by providing learning, production and network support. In-depth interviews with local sesame value chain actors and a structural equation model based on a survey involving 97 farmers in East Chad are implemented. The farmers involved are part of the EU Project “Peanut and sesame food chain support: from production to marketing” led by a governmental organization. Results show that collective action supportive activities can effectively leverage farmers’ market performances. Some policy implications for research and development organizations are finally discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper argues that large-scale land appropriation is displacing subsistence farmers and reworking agrarian social relations in northern Ghana. The recent wave of farmland enclosure has not only resulted in heightened land scarcity, but also fostered a marked social differentiation within farming communities. The dominant form of inequality is an evolving class of landless and near-landless farmers. The majority of households cope with such dynamics by deepening their own self-exploitation in the production process. The fulcrum of this self-exploitation is gendered property rights as part of the conjugal contract, with men exerting a far greater monopoly over land resources than had previously been the case. Due to acute land shortages, women’s rights to use land as wives, mothers and daughters are becoming insecure, as their vegetable plots are being reclassified as male-controlled household fields. The paper further documents the painful choices that landless farmers have to make in order to meet livelihood needs, including highly disciplined, yet low-waged, farm labor work and sharecropping contracts. In these livelihood pathways, there emerge, again, exploitative relations of production, whereby surplus is expropriated from land-dispossessed migrant laborers and concentrated with farm owners. These dynamics produce a ‘simple reproduction squeeze’ for the land-dispossessed. Overall, the paper contributes to the emerging land grabbing literature by showing geographically specific processes of change for large-scale mining operations and gendered differentiated impacts. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In Sub-Saharan Africa, fish ponds are often an integral part of farming systems but have suffered from a lack of viability and sustainability. The present study aims to understand the strategies used by fish farmers to overcome economic and environmental constraints. In 2008 and 2009, fish farmers were surveyed in Central and Western Cameroon, and the fish production systems were classified by cluster analysis. Four broad types were identified according to the complexity of household operations. The development of extensive systems (large-scale and low-input) in rural areas of central Cameroon is induced mainly by abundant available land. For semi-intensive systems in both regions (small-scale and high-input in the Western Region, large-scale and high-input in peri-urban areas of the Central Region), horizontal integration is not sufficient to make fish production profitable and sustainable. More intensive fish farms tend towards vertical integration, in which farmers establish close links with input suppliers. Main causes of low productivity of semi-intensive systems (1–2 t/ha/yr) are both lack of knowledge of fish farming principles by farmers and lack of technical improvement by extension agents and researchers which need to consider the local complexity of farming systems to develop and intensify fish production. The adaptation of development strategies to socio-economic and environmental contexts is a necessity to hope for an increase in fish pond aquaculture production in Africa. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Empirical studies of agrarian production in developing countries often find that small farms possess a productivity advantage over larger farms. Eswaran and Kotwal (1986) famously derive this inverse farm-size/productivity relationship from the structure of agrarian production. The focal prediction of their model is that, in otherwise equivalent economies, a more egalitarian land distribution raises both output and producer welfare. The traditional (spot) procurement system implicit in the Eswaran and Kotwal model, however, diverges fundamentally from modern (contractual) procurement practices. We therefore develop a new model of agrarian production in order to determine whether the introduction of a modern value chain alters the welfare effects of land redistribution. The inverse farm-size/productivity relationship persists in our model, but we find that more egalitarian land distribution leads to nonmonotonic changes in producer welfare. We also find that the introduction of a modern sector can harm the laboring classes. © The Authors 2017.

AB  - This study explores factors associated with success and intensity of livestock feed technologies use among positive deviants in feed technology adoption in Ethiopia. We used a nation-wide dataset of over 603 farm households, which surveyed pockets of successes in using improved livestock feed technologies. Heckman two-stage estimation procedures were used to identify factors associated with success and intensity of livestock feed technology use simultaneously. Results from the first stage of selection equation show that households socioeconomic and institutional factors such as education status of the head, herd size, exercise in feed technology utilization, cooperative membership, distance to district center, and diverse use of technologies have significant effect on success in livestock feed technologies adoption. The second stage demonstrates that intensity of household collaboration or network, membership in livestock related cooperatives, training, access to livestock feed technologies with packages, diverse use of technologies, engagement in livestock enterprises, livestock management system, willingness to invest more in feed technologies, and agro-ecologies significantly influence the intensity of feed technologies use. These results suggest that success and intensified use of improved feed technologies demand different entry strategies for risk factors, enablers, and behaviors, which may differ from the classic agricultural technologies transfer system. These include availability of appropriate biophysical and resource environments, functional linkages between different actors, access to inputs and social capital, and enabling institutional support system. Moreover, this study shows that when there is limited adoption, few pockets of success in improved technologies use, positive deviant approach would be more informative to understand the underlying factors and principles for success and intensified use of technologies than the most commonly reported conventional adoption rate studies. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Influenced by increasing population and prosperity, global wood needs are expected to treble by 2050, and an increased dependence on plantations will see demand for planted wood grow from 500 Mm3 to 1500 Mm3 over the next 30 years. Expansion of planted wood resources using conventional commercial plantation models is challenged in the crowded landscapes of Asia, where land tenure, access and ownership are ambiguous and it is unlikely that conventional plantations will be able to expand to meet demand. Forest assets managed by smallholder tree-farmers already make substantial contributions to national forest assets, wood production, exports and national incomes, and their role in wood production will become increasingly critical to meeting society’s needs. Benefits arising from the raw materials they produce are largely unrecognised in official statistics, partly because the many thousands of small stands of trees are widely scattered and flexibly managed by numerous tree-farmers as ‘living bank accounts’, being strongly influenced by emergency needs for immediate cash to satisfy family and social obligations. Using available data and credible assumptions, the probable contributions of smallholder assets to national economies and smallholder livelihoods have been calculated for acacias in Vietnam and eucalypts in Guangxi Province, China, along with smallholder contributions to commercial wood flows in several other Asian countries. More than 600 000 ha (equivalent) of unaccounted acacia smallholdings and informal plantings in Vietnam, annually produce more than 9 Mm3 of wood worth (as export woodchips) in excess of US$500 M. In Guangxi, commercial smallholder forest stands amount to about 800 000 ha of eucalypts, and produce in excess of 12 Mm3 of wood annually. This Chinese resource generates considerable employment and raw materials to industry worth over US$2.4 bn (bn; 1bn = 1 000 000 000) after local primary processing. In India, sales of commercial logs grown by smallholders add over US$700 M annually to rural economies and similar examples are offered for Lao PDR, Indonesia and Thailand. The numerous opportunities and impediments in smallholder forestry are discussed, with consequences for national policies. The role of traders within the forest products value chain is examined, and forest certification and the burden of compliance with complicated and onerous laws and regulations are discussed. Smallholder tree-farmers are entrepreneurs who expect their investments in smallholdings to produce financial (and other) benefits. Collectively, they represent multi-billion-dollar regional businesses, increasing incomes for many millions of households and creating significant national assets. To succeed, smallholder tree-farmers need the conditions summarised in 2001 as Byron’s ‘Four Keys’: (i) clear ownership of trees; (ii) reliable markets; (iii) sympathetic legal and regulatory frameworks; and (iv) a robust package of technical options. Reliable value chains and risk mitigation are important issues, and severe impediments in any of the ’Four Keys’ jeopardise the efficiency and effectiveness of the forest products value chain, the livelihoods and financial sustainability of the smallholder tree-farmers, and their substantial contributions to national productivity and forest assets. © 2017 Institute of Foresters of Australia (IFA).

AB  - Coffee is generally grown in areas derived from forest, and both its expansion and management cause biodiversity loss. Sustainability standards in coffee are well established but have been criticized while social and environmental impact is elusive. This paper assesses the issue-attention cycle of coffee production in India and Nicaragua, including producer concerns and responses over time to concerns (sustainability standards, public regulations and development projects). Systematic comparison of the socioeconomic, environmental and policy context in both countries is then used to explore potential effects of sustainability standards. Results show limits, in local context, to relevance of global certification approaches: in both countries due to naturally high levels of biodiversity within coffee production systems global standards are easily met. They do not provide recognition for the swing potential (difference between best and worst) and do not raise the bar of environmental outcomes though nationally biodiversity declines. Nicaraguan regulations have focused on the socioeconomic development of the coffee sector via strengthening producer organizations, while India prioritized environmental and biodiversity conservation. In India, externally driven sustainability standards partially replace the existing producer–buyer relationship while in Nicaragua standards are desired by producer organizations. The temporal comparison shows that recently local stakeholders harness improvements through their unique local value propositions: the ‘small producer’ symbol in Nicaragua and certification of geographic origin in India. Nicaragua builds on the strength of its smallholder sector while India builds on its strength of being home to a global biodiversity hotspot. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Ethiopia’s agricultural productivity is considered low despite the presence of various agricultural policies. These policies focus mainly on on-farm agricultural development to the neglect of rich opportunities for non-agricultural livelihood diversification activities. Livelihood diversification is a strategy that can boost farmers’ income and promote sustainable land management practices. This study investigates the factors that determine the probability that a farm household participates in non-agricultural income diversification activities in Ethiopia. It employed Logit econometric model to investigate the probability that a farm household participates in non-agricultural income diversification activities in the rural area, and the Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model to estimate a system of equations consisting of on-farm, off-farm and non-farm income generating activities of Ethiopia. Estimation showed that institutional factors such as secured perception of land ownership and becoming membership in cooperatives have significant influence on the probability of farm households’ participation in non-agricultural activities. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - In sub-Saharan countries, male farmers are frequently seen as producers of cash crops and marketable vegetables, while female farmers are perceived as producers of food crops for home consumption. Few authors have tried to validate this perception of gender in the production of traditional vegetables, and gender differences in access to resources and markets remain underexplored. The same holds true for traders of traditional vegetables who share the same value chain. The few studies available have tended to focus either on the household (as the unit of production) or on the market (for trade), neglecting interrelationships between the two. This knowledge gap must be addressed if men and women are to benefit equally from interventions to counteract poverty. A survey of 360 smallholder farmers and 82 vegetable traders in Tanzania was conducted under the “Africa Research in Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation” program funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and led by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). Its objective was to examine gender relationships within production and within trade, as well as between the actors in both groups. Research foci were on production activities and income, market performance and access to resources as important areas of gendered value chain analysis. Results show no pronounced gender division in the production process, with the exception of pest and disease management, input purchase and seed selection (all predominantly carried out by men). Clear differences between male and female farmers emerged in the allocation of income from various crops. An exploration of why leafy vegetables are grown revealed that the juxtaposition of food crops and cash crops in relation to gender needs to be rethought. Market performance of female producers of leafy vegetables was weaker than that of their male counterparts and that of female traders. Both male and female traders rated their decision-making power as high in relation to the income generated through vegetable sales. For female smallholders, access to land constituted a major constraint. Women in male-headed households had the least contact with extension officers and training. Without careful consideration of these and other results of gender analysis in value chains, interventions are at risk of failing to improve the livelihoods of producers and traders. © ISHS 2017.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not livelihood diversification strategies are significant predictors of rural households’ farmland management practices. To this end, the two-limit Tobit econometric model was employed to analyse the nexus between livelihood diversification and farmland management. The study incorporated 151 farm households in Gozamin District, East Gojjam, in Ethiopia. A survey questionnaire was used to gather data. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used as methods of data analysis. The result indicated that livelihood diversification, measured by the inverse Herfindahl–Hirschman diversity index, has a positive and significant effect on sustainable land management activities. Besides, farm households who participated in agricultural extension packages and those engaged in farm cooperatives and in non-farm wage employment activities joined significantly more in sustainable rural land management practices. The integrated rural livelihood and sustainable land management strategy that can help jointly maximise the farm household livelihood and the land management practices is required. Rural livelihood development policies need to promote and adapt rural institutions like farm cooperatives and comprehensive agricultural extension services. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - This study analyzes the Laiterie Du Berger (LDB)'s milk supply chain and its contribution to strengthening the food security and socioeconomic resources of Senegalese Sahelian pastoral households. Porter's value chain model is used to characterize the innovations introduced by the LDB dairy in its milk inbound logistics and supplier relationships. A socioeconomic food security index and qualitative data are used to assess the dairy's supply chain's contribution to strengthen smallholder households' livelihoods. Data for this research were obtained through individual surveys, focus groups and in-depth interviews of LDB managers and milk suppliers. Results show that milk income contributes significantly to household food security. Suppliers who stabilize their dairy income between rainy and dry seasons, diversify income sources and have larger herds are more likely to remain food secure. The LDB innovations contribute by helping herders access biophysical and economic resources, leading to better livestock feed and household food security. © 2017 Wane et al.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze determinants of farmers’ participation and credit rationing in microcredit programs using survey data from Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the Garrett Ranking Technique to analyze farmers’ reasons for participation or non-participation in credit programs, a probit regression model to estimate factors influencing farm households’ participation, and the Heckman’s sample selection model to identify factors influencing farm households’ probability of being credit rationed by microcredit programs. Findings: The results reveal that farm households participate in credit programs because of improved access to savings services and agricultural loans. Fear of loan default and lack of savings are reasons for non-participation in credit programs. Furthermore, membership in farmer-based organizations (FBOs) and the household head’s formal education are positively associated with farmers’ participation in credit programs. The likelihood of farmers being credit rationed (i.e. their loan applications were either rejected or the amount of credit they applied for was reduced) is less likely among higher income farmers and members of FBOs such as farmer cooperatives and savings clubs. Practical implications: The findings suggest that policy strategies aiming to improve access to savings and credit services should educate farmers and strengthen FBOs that could serve as entry points for financial service providers. Such market smart strategies have the potential to improve farmers’ access to financial services and reduce rural poverty. Originality/value: Although existing studies have examined farmers’ participation in credit markets and credit rationing separately, the unique contribution of this paper is the analysis of participation in microcredit programs as well as the likelihood of farmers being credit rationed in Ghana. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role that weather shocks can play in the livestock mortality microinsurance take-up when the insured risk has a prevalent covariant component. Design/methodology/approach: The sample consists of 360 rural Ethiopian households. Data were collected in a panel-structure at the end of three agricultural seasons (2011-2013). In the questionnaire, a specific section on insurance was meant to collect information on the farmer’s willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a set of insurance products, including livestock mortality insurance. Two OLS regression models and a quantile regression model were employed to estimate the impact of weather anomalies on the WTP for the insurance product. Findings: The authors find that weather anomalies contribute to changes in the WTP to a large extent. Negative (positive) changes in precipitation (temperature) anomalies can lead to more than a 30 percent reduction in the WTP. This general finding is complemented with the analysis of the conditional distribution of the WTP, which shows that other elements can prevail for low values of the conditional distribution. In this case, the WTP seems to be represented more by the interviewee’s age and basic knowledge of insurance, and village fixed-effects. Basic knowledge of insurance, in particular, can increase WTP by about 60 percent. Practical implications: This paper has straightforward implications from a policy perspective. It suggests that farmers would prefer an insurance premium that follows the changes in the systemic component. On the contrary, insurance as well as reinsurance companies are usually reluctant to frequently revise their premiums. Financial education programs, farmer-driven design, trust building, and bundling insurance with other financial and non-financial products can increase the value proposition perceived by the farmers. From a marketing perspective, the overall findings suggest that continuous fine-tuning of the contract, transparency, and targeted information campaigns can contribute to increase and stabilize potential customers’ WTP. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper that considers the impact of weather shocks on the WTP for a livestock mortality insurance product. Livestock is one of the most strategic assets of poor rural households in Africa. This study contributes to the theoretical and empirical literature on the determinants of weather insurance take-up in developing countries and, in particular, the role of spatiotemporal adverse selection and basis risk (e.g. Jensen et al., 2016). © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In developing regions with high levels of poverty and a dependence on climate sensitive agriculture, studies focusing on climate change adaptation, planning, and policy processes, have gained relative importance over the years. This study assesses the impact of farmer perceptions regarding climate change on the use of sustainable agricultural practices as an adaptation strategy in the Chinyanja Triangle, Southern Africa. In this empirical approach, we adopt methods that account for the plausibility that unmeasured characteristics exist, which are correlated with perceptions and the adoption of Sustainable Agricultural Practices. We use a unique and representative dataset collected in December 2012 and June 2013, from smallholder farmers in the Chinyanja Triangle. The results indicate that farmer's perceptions significantly influence the use of sustainable agricultural practices. Specifically, we established that farmer perceptions considerably impact the use of grain legume rotations, inorganic fertilizers, compost, and farmyard manure. Our results highlight the need for a serious and perhaps equal consideration of farmer perceptions regarding climate change, as important inputs to climate change adaptation policies targeted at enhancing climatic resilience in smallholder farming communities. This is plausible as the adaptation and pliability of farmers to the effects of climate change should be a social process involving the collective efforts from various stakeholders. © 2016 by the author.

AB  - Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has been systematically advanced within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, implementing REDD+ in a populated landscape requires information on local costs and acceptability of changed practices. To supply such information, many studies have adopted approaches that explore the opportunity cost of maintaining land as forest rather than converting it to agricultural uses. These approaches typically assume that the costs to the smallholder are borne exclusively through the loss or gain of the production values associated with specific categories of land use. However, evaluating the value of land to smallholders in incomplete and messy institutional and economic contexts entails other considerations, such as varying portfolios of land holdings, tenure arrangements, restricted access to capital, and unreliable food markets. We suggest that contingent valuation (CV) methods may provide a more complete reflection of the viability of REDD+ in multiple-use landscapes than do opportunity cost approaches. The CV approach eliminates the need to assume a homogenous smallholder, and instead assumes heterogeneity around social, economic and institutional contexts. We apply this approach in a southern rural Cameroonian context, through the lens of a hypothetical REDD+ contract. Our findings suggest local costs of REDD+ contracts to be higher and much more variable than opportunity cost estimates. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - A supply chain in disarray can be identified as a barrier not only to growth for the agricultural sector but also to achieving food security in a country because it may lead to either a deficiency in food production and/or too high prices. Using the dairy sector of Malawi as an example, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the coherence between market structure and the development strategy pursued by international donors. Within Malawi the dairy sector may be characterised as a segmented market: with both formal and informal milk markets, with smallholder producers serving both markets. The formal market includes few processing firms operating with idle capacity and selling dairy products to an affluent segment of the urban population, whilst the informal market comprises the sale of unprocessed milk products to the less affluent urban population and also rural areas. In this context, cooperative international action, conducted through agencies from a range of countries, is targeted at improving the efficiency of the formal supply chain and also the creation of local supply chains that sell processed products directly to poor consumers. The paper discusses reasons why these two cooperation strategies, given the structure of the sector, may potentially conflict with each other, the need to address the degree of market imperfection of the formal sector and the desirability of ex-ante coordination of plans amongst donors. © 2016, Revoredo-Giha and Renwick.

AB  - Pro-poor value chains intend to integrate smallholding farmers into high value markets to contribute to poverty alleviation and food security. Although income benefits of pro-poor value chains have been found, scant evidence exists regarding the potential for these markets to enhance food security. This study focuses on components of food access—dietary diversity, physical and financial access, and social acceptability—among households that participate in pro-poor value chains and non-participating households in the central highlands of Peru where development interventions have created high value market niches for the native potato varieties that smallholding farmers have conserved for thousands of years. Using a mixed methods approach, this study assessed dietary diversity among households that participate and do not participate in pro-poor value chains, as well as their perceptions of their food access. Findings indicated that households that participate in value chains have higher dietary diversity than non-participating households but that these differences are likely due to pre-existing differences in socioeconomic status rather than any causal effect provided by value chains. The study also concluded that while participation in pro-poor value chains sometimes enhance the purchasing power of participating households, they may also weaken financial access, important for both purchasing food and travel to make those purchases. Community perspectives also indicated concerns with the acceptability of diets, which cannot likely be comprehensively addressed by pro-poor value chains. Collectively, the findings from this study cast doubt on the assumption that a linear flow exists between pro-poor value chains and enhanced food access. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Standards have played an important role in food trade for a very long time. Their rapid growth in recent years has triggered vigorous debates on their impacts on international trade and development, with many arguing that standards are “non-tariff barriers” to trade and that standards are marginalizing the poor. I present conceptual frameworks and review empirical evidence on the equity and efficiency effects and the political economy of standards. Models which incorporate essential aspects of standards yield complex theoretical results and nuanced conclusions. Careful empirical analyses support such nuanced arguments and find complex effects. For trade, standards can create welfare gains but also involve rent redistribution which induces lobbying by interest groups to set the standards at their preferred level. This makes it difficult to distinguish socially desirable standards from those resulting from political rent-seeking. For development, it is crucial to explicitly account for (a) the endogeneity of the institutional organization of value chains and (b) both smallholder contracting and employment creation on large scale farms when considering the impact of standards on development and poverty. © 2016 International Association of Agricultural Economists

AB  - Despite setbacks, interest in Jatropha cultivation remains high. This study addressed the question to what extent Jatropha cultivation has replaced specific vegetation and land use types and how the existing areas are managed. Major forms of land use change and management practices were identified based on cluster analysis of data from 106 interviewee's responses to a comprehensive global survey. Of the 1.04 × 106 ha cultivated with Jatropha in 2011 40% were established on land that was cleared of vegetation as a result of logging activities unrelated to Jatropha cultivation, 34% was defined as unused, and the remainder was attributable to areas previously used for crops or animal husbandry. With the exception of croplands, these areas were dominated (90-98%) by a few internationally active companies whose cultivation models were almost exclusively based on outgrower schemes. Management practices were largely extensive in nature (low mechanical input and infrequent use of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides), and also dominated by large projects. Broad surveys, such as this, are useful in identifying general trends in this emerging global industry, but detailed case studies, particularly of large projects, are needed in order to draw more informed conclusions about the site-specific impacts of Jatropha cultivation. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Recent studies on the resilience of rural farmers in developing regions revealed a close connection between vulnerability, adapted livelihood mechanisms/strategies, and livelihood resilience. Resilience is reflected by the smallholder farmers’ capacity for survival. This paper tries to understand the nexus between the ecological vulnerability of a rural agricultural community suffering from detrimental effects of climate variability and farmers’ ways of adapting to the changing environment. Drawn from empirical research carried out in several ecologically critical agricultural regions of Indonesia, the study notes several adaptive livelihood mechanisms that reflect the way rural people withstand crises. By adapting to crises, these people constructively build resilience. Three adaptive mechanisms that increase livelihood resilience are economic adaptive mechanisms, ecological adaptive mechanisms, and social adaptive mechanisms. Farmers adopt a set of strategies to survive such as crop diversification, utilizing available natural resources, selling assets, asking for help, borrowing money, and creating and using social-network-based collective action to guarantee social security. The study used qualitative and quantitative methodologies to gain data and information. The study proposes that livelihood resilience develops as a response to ecological vulnerability. The authors conclude that rural livelihood resilience is the result of a set of continual adaptations that smallholder farmers employ to respond to crises and vulnerabilities. © Common Ground Publishing, Arya Hadi Dharmawan, Eka Intan Kumala Putri, and Dyah Ita Mardiyaningsih, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Using an original dataset from the Vietnamese catfish sector, I analyze the impact of vertical coordination options, namely, contract farming and vertical integration, on farm performance, which is measured in terms of yields and revenue per hectare. The effects of vertical coordination are estimated using a maximum simulated likelihood estimator and a two-stage least square regression with instrumental variables to account for endogenous farm and household characteristics and selection on unobservable characteristics. The results show that vertically integrated farms have substantially higher yields and revenue per hectare than nonintegrated farms. The levels of gains that can be attributed to integration are large and consistent under different estimation procedures, and there is no difference between nonintegrated and contract farms in terms of farm performance. © 2016 International Association of Agricultural Economists

AB  - Addressing the global challenges of climate change (CC), food security and poverty alleviation requires enhancing the adaptive capacity and mitigation potential of land use systems. To this end, Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) aims to identify land use practices that sustainably increase productivity, enhance climate change (CC) adaptation and contribute to CC mitigation. A transition towards CSA requires technical, but also socio-institutional changes, for improved smallholder agricultural systems. Such changes may be triggered by stakeholder participation processes that stimulate social learning and collective action. This article evaluates whether a role-playing game (RPG) is an effective participatory tool to encourage social learning and collective action among local stakeholders towards adoption of CSA strategies. We designed and implemented an RPG with three groups of farmers in Apuí (Southern Amazonas), evaluating the game's impact on social learning by interviewing each farmer before and after the RPG. Our findings show that the RPG induced not only technical learning, but also socio-institutional learning and engagement for collective action, though outcomes varied between different RPG sessions and among farmer participants. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: An extensive body of evidence in the field of agro-ecology claims to show the positive effects that maintenance of ecosystem services can have on meeting future food demand by making farms more sustainable, productive and resilient, which then contributes to improved nutrition and livelihoods of farmers. However, inconsistent effects have commonly been reported, while empirical evidence to support assumed improvements is largely lacking. Overall, a coherent synthesis and review of the evidence of these claims is largely absent from the literature. Methods: Systematic searches of peer-reviewed research were conducted in bibliographic databases of Web of Science, SCOPUS, AGRICOLA, AGRIS databases and CAB abstracts, and grey literature from Google Scholar, and 32 subject-specific websites. Searches identified 21,147 articles. After screening, 746 studies were included in the final map. Results: Of the 19 conservation land management practices considered, soil fertilisation (24 %), tillage (23 %), agroforestry (9 %), and water conservation (7 %) were most commonly studied. Ecosystem services most commonly studied were supporting (55 %) and regulating (33 %), particularly carbon sequestration/storage, nutrient cycling and soil/water regulation/supply. Key data gaps identified included the absence of long-term records (with datasets spanning >20 years), studies located in North and Central Africa, research that focuses on smallholder landscapes, and studies that span different scales (regional and landscape levels). Conclusions: The study employs systematic mapping combined with an online interactive platform that geographically maps results, which allows users to interrogate different aspects of the evidence through a defined database field structure. While studies are not directly comparable, the database of 746 studies brings together a previously fragmented and multidisciplinary literature base, and collectively provides evidence concerning a wide range of conservation land management practices impacting key ecosystem services. The systematic map is easily updatable, and may be extended for additional coding, analysed to assess the quality of studies, or used to inform future systematic reviews. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Nepal's population continues to grow, but the agricultural sector's performance remains almost stagnant. This has led to a decline in the per capita availability of food. Increasing agricultural productivity is the key to agricultural growth, and one strategy for increasing agricultural productivity is to use improved seeds. This study investigates the impact of contract farming (CF) in high yielding varieties (HYV) of paddy seed production on costs, yield, and profits of smallholder farms in Nepal. Using farm-level data and a non-parametric propensity score matching estimator, the study finds a significant positive impact of contract HYV seed farming on revenues, profits, and yield, and a significant negative impact on total costs of production. Additionally, very small farms (≤0.43 ha) with CF in HYV paddy seeds tend to gain the most when it comes to yield per hectare. Our estimates reveal that the average smallholder household in Nepal engaged in CF with input conditions receives higher profits. However, farmers engaged in CF with output conditions tend to have higher yields but smaller profits. Finally, farmers engaged in CF in HYV paddy seeds with both input and output conditions have the highest yield gains and significantly higher profits. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Self-efficacy is the belief of an individual to have the ability to be successful in a given domain. Social capital is the economic value of a person's relationships. In the context of this study, self-efficacy is the belief of a farmer to be able to improve her income with contract farming, which increases her actual ability. Social capital increases the ability of the farmers through social support.We surveyed 400 smallholder pineapple farmers and find that both self-efficacy and social capital are decisive for their successful integration into contract farming. To identify causal effects, we use two instruments, which are also of interest on their own: the historical presence of (1) cocoa cooperatives and (2) Christian missionary schools. During Ghana's colonial period, the British established cocoa cooperatives, which differed in their performance as a function of biogeographic factors and thus persistently shaped the self-efficacy of the farmers. Roughly at the same time, Christian missionaries established missionary schools, which impacted the traditional societies so that social capital decreased. The finding that self-efficacy and social capital are still shaped by historic variables could indicate that these variables are only slowly changing, or that they only do so in the absence of policy intervention. The latter raises the possibility that effective policies could benefit from strong reinforcing feedbacks once self-efficacy and social capital improve. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Rwandan Government’s National Domestic Biogas programme (NDBP), seeks to deliver renewable energy services to households across the country by promoting family-sized anaerobic (biogas) digesters on a large scale. The NDBP policy is implemented at different levels, from government and private contractors to households. We analysed the scheme, focusing on how policy was implemented across two districts, namely Kirehe and Kamonyi, and we interviewed rural households and biogas service providers. The NDBP delivers improved energy service outcomes to a majority of households. Training and education of householders, particularly women, is needed in relation to the maintenance of digesters, feedstock suitability and the environmental as well as the potential livelihood benefits of digestate. There is a need for appropriate implementation strategies, financial support and coordination of biogas programmes. Financial institutions and cooperatives should be involved for policy implementation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article addresses smallholder oil palm farming in Indonesia and the risk of falling into poverty by comparing contract and non-contract smallholders. We use an asset-based approach to define vulnerability and apply propensity score matching analysis to assess the impact of contract farming. Data were collected from a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2010 of 245 oil palm smallholder households, 126 of which were contract smallholders. The study finds that approximately 40 per cent of oil palm smallholders can be classified as stochastic-transient poor. We also show that while contract participation reduces the negative impact of oil palm price shocks, this is not the case for production shocks. The study concludes that despite positive income effects, contract smallholders also remain vulnerable to poverty. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Rapid land-use change in the tropics causes dramatic losses in biodiversity and associated functions. In Sumatra, Indonesia, lowland rainforest has mainly been transformed by smallholders into oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) monocultures, interspersed with jungle rubber (rubber agroforests) and a few forest remnants. In two regions of the Jambi province, we conducted point counts in 32 plots of four different land-use types (lowland rainforest, jungle rubber, rubber plantation and oil palm plantation) as well as in 16 nearby homegardens, representing a small-scale, traditional agricultural system. We analysed total bird abundance and bird abundance in feeding guilds, as well as species richness per point count visit, per plot, and per land-use system, to unveil the conservation importance and functional responses of birds in the different land-use types. In total, we identified 71 species from 24 families. Across the different land-use types, abundance did not significantly differ, but both species richness per visit and per plot were reduced in plantations. Feeding guild abundances between land-use types were variable, but homegardens were dominated by omnivores and granivores, and frugivorous birds were absent from monoculture rubber and oil palm. Jungle rubber played an important role in harbouring forest bird species and frugivores. Homegardens turned out to be of minor importance for conserving birds due to their low sizes, although collectively, they are used by many bird species. Changes in functional composition with land-use conversion may affect important ecosystem functions such as biological pest control, pollination, and seed dispersal. In conclusion, maintaining forest cover, including degraded forest and jungle rubber, is of utmost importance to the conservation of functional and taxonomic bird diversity. © 2016 Prabowo et al.

AB  - This study examines the impacts of participation in off-farm work and land tenancy contracts on the intensity of investment in soil-improving measures and farm productivity. A multivariate Tobit model that accounts for potential endogeneity between the intensity of investment and the off-farm work and tenancy contract variables is estimated for 341 rural households in Punjab province of Pakistan. An instrumental variable approach is also used to analyse the impact of tenancy contract and off-farm work on farm productivity. The empirical results show that participation in off-farm work and tenure security tends to increase the intensity of investment in long-term soil-improving measures. We also find that increases in off-farm work and tenure security exert significant and positive effects on farm productivity. © 2016 Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.

AB  - This study assesses the impact of cooperative membership among dairy producers in Selale, Ethiopia. We selected ten impact indicators: proportion of dairy income to total household income, total dairy income, proportion of crossbreed cows to the total number of cows in the herd (indicator of technological innovation), amount of feed bought (another indicator of technological innovation), milk production, milk productivity, commercialization, price per liter of milk, price per kg of butter and the share of milk production that is processed at the household level. In order to minimize the biases that may arise by simply comparing members and non-members, we employed a propensity score matching technique. The empirical analysis shows that cooperatives are strong in facilitating technological transformations and commercialization but weak in offering better prices. These findings suggest structural trade-offs between different domains of cooperatives' action. Overall, our study concludes that cooperatives can be efficient business institutions to foster rural development and food security. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Based on data from 412 households, this study used the sustainable livelihoods approach to analyse changes in livelihood strategies and the relationship between those changes and rural household attitudes in an eastern coastal region of China. Focussing on household off-farm employment decisions and land transfer decisions, we classified the households into six types based on their livelihood strategies, namely, off-farm employment-oriented, balanced, off-farm, idle, professional, and conventional. The survey results indicate that two capital factors, age and education, and two mediating factors, wage and crop prices, are important influences of off-farm employment decisions, whereas factors such as policies and subsidies, machinery, activities organized by local agricultural cooperatives, and land rent substantially influence land transfer decisions. By analysing the characteristics, trends and driving factors of livelihood transitions, i.e., changes in rural household livelihood strategies, from 1993 to 2013, we explored the mechanisms of livelihood transitions. The results indicate that the proportion of conventional households decreased and the proportion of off-farm employment-oriented households and off-farm households increased. Agricultural production transformed from a system of scattered households (conventional and off-farm employment-oriented households) into broad-scale management households (professional and balanced households). These changes were the main characteristics of livelihood transitions under rapid industrialization combined with rapid urbanization in the Qingpu district. Rural livelihood transitions exhibited a stepped pattern, going through an initial stage, a self-organizing stage, and a government-led stage. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The indirect effects of biofuels are mostly considered negative. In this paper, we argue that there may be a positive indirect effect of biofuels on food security and poverty. Using micro-level evidence and a matched plot pair design through which we control for plot and farmer characteristics, we show that the introduction of castor production for biofuel in a poor country as Ethiopia can significantly improve food productivity of rural households who produce raw material for biofuel production. This spillover seems particularly linked to enhanced access to inputs and technical assistance which were provided as part of biofuel feedstock production contracts. Our results thus document another mechanism through which biofuels may influence smallholders' food security, a mechanism that did not receive attention so far. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Small farmers' participation in global value chains is of prime importance for inclusive agricultural development in developing countries like India. However, the issue of inclusiveness of modern arrangements like contract farming and the determinants of participation in such arrangements is understudied in such contexts. This paper examines the issue of small farmers' participation in contract farming arrangements in Punjab, where farming is dominated by medium and relatively large farms. Based on a sample of contract and non-contract farmers, this paper examines the relationship between the farmers' resourcefulness and contract farming participation, selectivity bias, and its impact on farm income. It finds that the contract and the non-contract farmers differ in terms of education, agricultural machinery ownership, and owned and operational landholdings. Small farmers are not, by and large, part of contract farming practice in the studied crops and the selectivity bias exists in contract farming; however, it does not have any significant impact on farm income. Small farmers' participation can be improved through better institutional mechanisms, including group contracts and incentives for contracting agencies to work with small farmers.

AB  - In this study cross-section data was used to analyze the effect of farmers' demographic, socioeconomic and institutional setting, market access and physical attributes on the probability and intensity of tissue culture banana (TCB) adoption. The study was carried out between July 2011 and November 2011. Both descriptive (mean, variance, promotions) and regression analysis were used in the analysis. A double hurdle regression model was fitted on the data. Using multistage sampling technique, four counties and eight sub-locations were randomly selected. Using random sampling technique, three hundred and thirty farmers were selected from a list of banana households in the selected sub-locations. The adoption level of tissue culture banana (TCB) was about 32%. The results also revealed that the likelihood of TCB adoption was significantly influenced by: availability of TCB planting material, proportion of banana income to the total farm income, per capita household expenditure and the location of the farmer in Kisii County; while those that significantly influenced the intensity of TCB adoption were: occupation of farmers, family size, labour source, farm size, soil fertility, availability/access of TCB plantlets to farmers, distance to banana market, use of manure in planting banana, access to agricultural extension services and index of TCB/non-TCB banana cultivar attributes which were scored by farmers. Compared to West Pokot County, farmers located in Bungoma County are more significantly and likely to adopt TCB technology. Therefore, the results of the study suggest that the probability of adoption and intensity of the use of TCB should be enhanced. This can be done by taking cognizance of these variables in order to meet the priority needs of the smallholder farmers who were the target group. This would lead to alleviating banana shortage in the region for enhanced food security. Subsequently, actors along the banana value chain are encouraged to target the intervention strategies based on the identified farmer, farm and institutional characteristics for enhanced impact on food provision. Opening up more TCB multiplication centres in different regions will make farmers access the TCB technology for enhanced impact on the target population.

AB  - We use recent data from 253 smallholder producer organisations (SPOs) in Ethiopia, Malawi and Senegal, factor and regression analysis to define organisational health, understand its determinants and relate health to performance. We find that latent health evolves according to a life cycle and that start up incentives and design rules are important determinants of an organisation's progression through this life cycle. Health, in turn, is found to explain SPO performance measured in terms of profits. Healthier and more profitable SPOs are those with an economic justification at establishment, those initially pursuing defensive objectives and those SPOs that have put in place a strategy for capital formation. More educated presidents contribute to the health of an SPO but it is also shown that when the president of the SPO is female, profits are lower while the organisation is not healthier. © 2016 F.

AB  - Smallholder farmers" participation in agricultural cooperatives is often promoted as a promising strategy for overcoming market imperfections and to increase farmers" productivity and income. In recognition of this potential, in recent years, Ethiopia has shown renewed interest in promoting cooperatives. However, there is lack of empirical evidence of the impact that cooperatives have on farmers" performance in Ethiopia. Using a matching technique, we evaluate the impact of coffee cooperatives on the performance of their member households in terms of income and coffee production. We use data from coffee farmers in south-west Ethiopia. The overall results suggest that members of cooperatives are not faring much better than non-members. The treatment effects we measured were not statistically significant from zero. Yet, the aggregate figures mask differences between cooperatives and amongst individual cooperative members. Average treatment effects on members differ between cooperatives, in general older members, those who have benefitted from more education and those with larger coffee plantations seem to benefit more from membership. Our analysis sheds light on the heterogeneity in the impact that membership of a cooperative can have: this differs by cooperative and by members within cooperatives, a finding that has important policy implications. © 2016 Shumeta and D'Haese.

AB  - While linking smallholder farmer to dairy value chain industry has identified as a potential pathway to get out of poverty trap by raising incomes and by increasing the availability of nutrient-dense foods in Ethiopia, much less is known about the poverty implication of smallholder participation in dairy value chain. We assess nutrition impacts of smallholder farmers’ participation in the formal milk value chain with cross sectional survey data from Ethiopia. To assess smallholder farmer households’ food and nutrition security outcomes, we employed multiple food access measurements such as per capita dietary energy intake, food consumption score, and household income. We use propensity score matching model to analyze impact pathways. The results show that as compared to households without participation, households with participation have higher dietary energy intake, dietary diversity, and household income. However, there is a negative association between participation in the milk value chain and level of milk consumption. We find that smallholder farmer participation in milk value chain has a positive significant effect on food sufficiency, dietary diversity and income. This study, therefore, confirms the potential role of smallholder farmers’ participation in agri-food value chain to get out of poverty trap through improving rural household income, food security and nutrition. © 2016, International Academy of Business and Economics.

AB  - Climate change is expected to have particularly severe effects on poor agrarian populations. Rural households in developing countries adapt to the risks and impacts of climate change both individually and collectively. Empirical research has shown that access to capital-financial, human, physical, and social-is critical for building resilience and fostering adaptation to environmental stresses. Little attention, however, has been paid to how social capital generally might facilitate adaptation through trust and cooperation, particularly among rural households and communities. This paper addresses the question of how social capital affects adaptation to climate change by rural households by focusing on the relationship of household and collective adaptation behaviors. A mixed-methods approach allows us to better account for the complexity of social institutions-at the household, community, and government levels-which drive climate adaptation outcomes. We use data from interviews, household surveys, and field experiments conducted in 20 communities with 400 households in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Our results suggest that qualitative measures of trust predict contributions to public goods, a result that is consistent with the theorized role of social capital in collective action. Yet qualitative trust is negatively related to private household-level adaptation behaviors, which raises the possibility that social capital may, paradoxically, be detrimental to private adaptation. Policymakers should account for the potential difference in public and private adaptation behaviors in relation to trust and social capital when designing interventions for climate adaptation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Strengthening the abilities of smallholder farmers in developing countries, particularly women farmers, to produce for both home and the market is currently a development priority. In many contexts, ownership of assets is strongly gendered, reflecting existing gender norms and limiting women’s ability to invest in more profitable livelihood strategies such as market-oriented agriculture. Yet the intersection between women’s asset endowments and their ability to participate in and benefit from agricultural interventions receives minimal attention. This paper explores changes in gender relations and women’s assets in four agricultural interventions that promoted high value agriculture with different degrees of market-orientation. Findings suggest that these dairy and horticulture projects can successfully involve women and increase production, income and the stock of household assets. In some cases, women were able to increase their control over production, income and assets; however in most cases men’s incomes increased more than women’s and the gender-asset gap did not decrease. Gender- and asset-based barriers to participation in projects as well as gender norms that limit women’s ability to accumulate and retain control over assets both contributed to the results. Comparing experiences across the four projects, especially where projects implemented adaptive measures to encourage gender-equitable outcomes, provides lessons for gender-responsive projects targeting existing and emerging value chains for high value products. Other targeted support to women farmers may also be needed to promote their acquisition of the physical assets required to expand production or enter other nodes of the value chain. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This study examined factors associated with latrine ownership across different formative research studies and the extent to which these may differ among households from the poorest quintiles. Cross-sectional data was collected between 2008 and 2012 from households in rural areas of Tanzania, Indonesia (East Java), and multiple states of India. A framework, SaniFOAM, guided factors theorized to influence latrine ownership. Multivariate analysis was used to build country-specific models predicting latrine ownership. Factors associated with latrine ownership included: satisfaction with the current place of open defecation, perceptions of the adequacy of water and land for latrine ownership, social norms, sanctions and enforcement, and perceived latrine affordability. Emotional, physical and social drivers also showed a significant positive adjusted association with latrine ownership. Apart from one exception, there was no interaction between the behavioural determinants and wealth on latrine ownership. We conclude that understanding the factors which prevent or facilitate the widespread construction of latrines will inform interventions aimed at changing collective behaviour and creating demand for improved sanitation. © Practical Action Publishing, 2015.

AB  - Value chains are an increasingly popular approach to understanding complex policy challenges in agricultural development. However, value chain research and development has often been too narrowly focused on the structural elements of production, resulting in lack of adaptive capacity. Drawing on the concept of communities of practice, this paper seeks to operationalize an understanding of how the social relations that underpin smallholder-related value chains can be better supported to enhance resilience. Case studies from the Caribbean are then used to illustrate how a community of practice approach to value chain development might facilitate the formation of social capital. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Carmine cochineal, Dactylopius coccus Costa, was introduced to northern Ethiopia to add considerable value to existing cactus pear vegetation that in places like the southern Tigray was becoming an invasive plant. It became an investment opportunity where Foodsafe, a Chilean company was involved. Company was granted 300 ha at the cactus pear infested plains of southern Tigray. Foodsafe was also expected to expand cochineal production through an outgrower scheme. It created employment opportunity for the locals and started exporting dried cochineal to Mexico and Germany bringing in foreign currency. As cactus pear grows in communal lands, conflict of interest arose and it polarised the community. The company was forcibly closed and it was a tragedy that a one time commercial insect became a full-fledged invasive insect pest. Attempts to contain the insect with mechanical and chemical control were not successful. So far more than 16,000 ha of cactus pear land was infested with carmine cochineal. 13,000 ton of dried cochineal could have been harvested in a single year, generated USD $52 million, and part of that money could have been used for its management. © 2015, Professional Association for Cactus Development.

AB  - Rice industry is vital for food security and the economic development of Myanmar as its economy relies on agriculture sector. Promoting the marketing capability of farmers especially the smallholders is the key challenge of increasing farm investment. The rice fanners generally have channels selling to (1) the brokers or commission men who come and collect at the farm gate, (2) the collectors or traders at the farm gate, and (3) selling directly to the rice mills nearby towns. Assessing from different channels is central for exploiting the potential to increase production, farm income and investment. However there are restrictions in channel choices because of poor infrastructure, lack of marketing facilities, insufficient credit and up to date market information. Moreover, due to the oligopsony market structure and without organization, individual marketing practices exposes them to high transaction costs with low bargaining position. The majority of farmers unable to receive a fair price as they have to sell their products soon after harvest when the price is generally low because of the immediate cash need for repayment. So, the farmers cannot maximize profit which in turn affects the future investment of paddy farmers. This paper investigates the factors determine the marketing channel choice using the Multinomial Logit Model. The results show the probability of selling at the farm gate is increase with the distance to market. The farmers who possess storage, transportation, larger quantity and access of market information are more likely to sell the remunerative direct marketing channels to the rice mills directly. The result underscore the importance of forming the farmers' cooperative, development of marketing infrastructures, accessibility of up to date marketing information in order to support farmers bargaining power to develop farm's profit and investment.

AB  - The present and future shortage of farm labour for agriculture requires consideration in. developing countries including Nigeria. As much as 80 % of farm power is provided for by human labour which now call for need to develop and possibly engage simple and avoidable equipment to replace some manual tools for farming operations. Adoption of power tillers for tilling has brought some significant changes on overall production and sustainability of small farm systems. Addressing this requires acquisition of appropriate mechanized farm, tillage tools. This began with the technical and social- economic assessment and recommendation for adoption which took place at Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, South West of Nigeria based on performance efficiency, affordability, durability, acceptability and ease of operation for the smallholders. A 6 hp (4.48 kw) Husqvarna T560 RS rotary cultivator of 0.78 m width was acquired for field performance test for appraisal and adoption, for small scale farming as part of the front-end concern in the procurement- adoption chain. The effective field capacity of the machine on a land that was already under cultivation was found to be 0.033 ha/hr (i.e. 5 working days/ hectare) and about 12 hours to till one acre, in well cleared stone-free soil type where it was tested. The soil tillage of this equipment was found suitable for crops that can tolerate zero to shallow tillage depth of 0.21 m which this equipment was able to provide in the sandy loam under friable soil moisture condition. The awareness of the machine was 39 % among the farmers, 67 % rated the machine useful for tillage but the machine price range was above what their individual income can sustain in the study area. The machine was hereby recommended only for introduction to research institutions, private horticulturalists and vegetable cooperative farmers in the rural and urban farming communities with one to two hectare farm holding capacity.

AB  - Protection from downside risk is a determinant of technology uptake among subsistence agricultural households. Access to credit, insurance and savings may stimulate technology adoption where new methods are riskier but higher-yielding or require sunk costs. In this paper, we employ a dynamic, stochastic, heterogeneous agent model where farm households have access to contingent credit and make savings, technology and loan repayment choices. Our approach is novel as insurance is modeled as a meso-level product, where the bank is indemnified before any payouts are distributed to borrowers; thus, it accounts for both supply- and demand-side concerns, showing a flow of effects when index insurance contracts are sold to risk aggregators for whom basis risk is lower. Results show letting the lender lay first claim on indemnities lowers default, which can decrease interest rates and expand credit access. Insurance and savings may also spur technology uptake. © 2015.

AB  - We use new data on 500 Farmer-Based Organizations (FBOs) in Ghana and regression analysis to reveal determinants of collective investments and the case of the Millennium Development Authority's (MiDA) agricultural program in Ghana to demonstrate that development programs offering hard incentives may be counterproductive in promoting collective action. We show that when a program sets criteria for participation and offers in-cash and in-kind support to selected FBOs, it may promote rent-seeking and crowd out equity capital formation. This is so because FBOs may have formed for the sole purpose of benefitting from incentives offered by the program and thus lack an economic justification, which is an important condition for progression through the cooperative life cycle. Further, by setting stringent participation criteria, the program may end up selecting younger organizations while it is the more consolidated organizations that are able to connect to business development services (BDS) and engage in more offensive collective action. © 2015 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of the study was to identify the economic impacts of landmine clearance on household livelihoods and to present the qualitative findings of a study undertaken in the Kurdish region of Iraq. Design/methodology/approach – The sampling method followed a case series, purposive sampling design. Five recipient households were interviewed from different districts. In addition, purposively selected program staff (N = 4) and local community leaders (N = 2) were interviewed. When undertaking the thematic analysis of the Kurdish household qualitative interviews, it became very apparent that the Kurdish informants did not talk in terms of economic outcomes as a result of demining. The data were then re-analyzed using a narrative framework and reported in this paper. Findings – While the research sought a link between demining, livelihoods, poverty reduction and economic development, the respondents told another story. Their story focused on the social consequences of returning to their “grandfather’s land”. Participants’ narratives told of resilience resulting from negotiation with the environment and the importance of regaining one’s identity and hopes to heal in the face of adversity. Research limitations/implications – The findings cannot be generalized to all mine action program recipients but have salience for rural households in the site of inquiry. Originality/value – The paper is rare in illustrating the social benefits of post-conflict demining and its links with social capital and collective resilience. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Despite massive expansion of human and livestock populations, fuelled by agricultural innovations, nearly one billion people are hungry and 2 billion are sickened each year from the food they eat. Agricultural and food systems are intimately connected to health outcomes, but health policy and programs often stop at the clinic door. A consensus is growing that the disconnection between agriculture, health and nutrition is at least partly responsible for the disease burden associated with food and farming. Mycotoxins produced by fungi are one of the most serious food safety problems affecting staple crops (especially maize and groundnuts). Aflatoxins, the best studied of these mycotoxins, cause around 90,000 cases of liver cancer each year and are strongly associated with stunting and immune suppression in children. Mycotoxins also cause major economic disruptions through their impacts on trade and livestock production. In this paper we use the case of fungal toxins to explore how agricultural research can produce innovations, understand incentives and enable institutions to improve, simultaneously, food safety, food accessibility for poor consumers and access to markets for smallholder farmers, thus making the case for research investors to support research into agricultural approaches for enhancing food safety in value chains. We first discuss the evolution of food safety research within the CGIAR. Then we show how taking an epidemiological and economic perspective on aflatoxin research connects health and nutrition outcomes. Finally, we present three case studies illustrating the traditional strengths of CGIAR research: breeding better varieties and developing new technologies. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Amid declining yield of apple (Malus domestica) in Balochistan, this study analyzed yield gaps of commonly grown varieties ‘Katja’ (Malus domestica ’Katy’) and Red Delicious (Malus domestica ‘Borkh’) grown at experimental station and in farmers’ fields using data collected through a survey of 181 officially designated small farmers in Mastung district in Balochistan, Pakistan. The average actual yields of commonly grown Katja and Red Delicious apple in farmers’ fields were below one-third of the experimental station yields, leading to an average experimental-station based yield gap (YGE) of about 14,593 and 15,942 kg hectare−1, respectively. A significant variation in the yields of both varieties was also found within farmers’ fields. The average yield gaps between the model-farmer (farmer with highest yield) and common farmer yields (YGM) were 4960 and 7288 kg hectare−1 for Katja and Red Delicious, respectively. Yield gap indexes (YGI) were also developed to calculate yield variability between experimental station and current farmers’ yield (YGIE), and also within farmers’ yield variability (YGIM). The mean YGIE was 69.3%, whereas the mean YGIM was 46.5%, indicating the possibility of increasing yield by 53.5%. Farmer’s experience in apple farming, household labor force size, tree density, soil suitability, weed management, access to credit and extension services, and attendance of training on apple farming had significantly influenced apple yield gap. Landholding size and contract apple marketing system were other factors significantly expanding the yield gap. Addressing constraints to farmers’ access to yield-improving resources and farm management would be a vital step towards significant productivity improvements in apple farming.

AB  - This study uses new household data from Burkina Faso and regression analysis to further our understanding of household behaviour in relation to health care systems. We model the household decision-making process regarding health care utilisation in three steps: the perception of illness, choosing a treatment regime and health expenditure. In particular, we explain-at the individual level-the contraction of one of four diseases (malaria, digestive tract problems, respiratory infection and influenza). We then explain the choice of a treatment regime-home treatment or treatment at a public health facility-conditional upon the individual contracting a particular disease and estimate a health expenditure function conditional upon an individual contracting a particular disease and on the choice of treatment. Disease type is found to explain both treatment choice and health care expenditure with households more likely to opt for home treatment for influenza and with respiratory infection as the most expensive to treat. We also find that treatment at a public health facility implies much higher expenses. Our results also point to a gender bias with health care spending significantly higher for male household members. Further, asset poor households are more likely to opt for home treatment while migrants, as a source of information or even medication, reduce this likelihood. © The Author 2014.

AB  - Taenia solium cysticercosis is a disease of pigs and humans populations considered endemic in many developing countries of Latin America, Africa, and South East Asia having serious impact on public health and agriculture. We conducted an in-depth comparative analysis of literature on the disease situation and predisposing factors in selected countries known to be at the interface of poverty-emerging livestock systems-zoonoses and with a growing small holder pig industry. Transmission, methods of diagnosis and employed control strategies of T. solium infection in pig and human populations in these countries are also discussed. Limited knowledge on porcine cysticercosis (PC) by various stakeholders expected to be key players in its control has undermined efforts for eliminating this potentially eradicable condition. Poor pig production practices, poor hygiene, and sanitation habits have also been important in the maintenance of the T. solium life-cycle. The major gaps identified in this review include scanty current information on PC prevalence in pigs with hardly any reports on the condition in humans in most developing countries. Factors affecting pattern of the infection and how they interact at the different levels of the pig value chain have not been exhaustively studied. Information on socioeconomic and public health impact is inadequate and not current. © The authors.

AB  - Smallholders in developing countries are facing high transaction costs and difficulties in accessing technology to improve productivity. This paper aims at exploring how technology acquisition and market access have driven smallholder honey farmers to contract participation or cooperative engagement by taking evidence from a sample of 412 honey producers in northern Ethiopia. A multinomial logistic regression model was employed. Both the descriptive and the empirical model suggest that market access, credit and technology constraint, an institutional void, household wealth and farmers’ networks are the driving forces for smallholders’ participation in contract and cooperative engagements. In addition, high value products are calling for contracts. Creation of access to credit, technology and market linkages to smallholders appear to be areas of intervention to upgrade the honey value chain and to mitigate high transaction costs and technology constraints. © 2015 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.

AB  - Recent research on payments for environmental services (PES) has observed that high transaction costs (TCs) are incurred through the implementation of PES schemes and farmer participation. TCs incurred by households are considered to be an obstacle to the participation in and efficiency of PES policies. This study aims to understand transactions related to previous forest plantation programmes and to estimate the actual TCs incurred by farmers who participated in these programmes in a mountainous area of northwestern Vietnam. In addition, this study examines determinants of households’ TCs to test the hypothesis of whether the amount of TCs varies according to household characteristics. Results show that average TCs are not likely to be a constraint for participation since they are about 200,000 VND (USD 10) per household per contract, which is equivalent to one person’s average earnings for about two days of labour. However, TCs amount to more than one-third of the programmes’ benefits, which is relatively high compared to PES programmes in developed countries. This implies that rather than aiming to reduce TCs, an appropriate agenda for policy improvement is to balance the level of TCs with PES programme benefits to enhance the overall attractiveness of afforestation programmes for smallholder farmers. Regression analysis reveals that education, gender and perception towards PES programmes have significant effects on the magnitude of TCs. The analyses also points out the importance of local conditions on the level of TCs, with some unexpected results. © 2015 Lemos Editorial e Graficos Ltda. All rights reserved.

AB  - The structure of dairy supply chains in developing countries often shows a large diversity of organization usually based on smallholder farmers' involvement. This paper investigates how a dual supply chain combining both formal and informal markets with predominantly smallholder farmers impacts farmer-processor interactions at technical and organizational level in a Peruvian Andean valley. The analysis is based on three complementary field studies conducted between 2009 and 2012. Results show a large diversity of supply channels in formal and informal chains. Milk flows are observed between formal and informal processors based on a mix of competition and complementarity depending on the season of the year and the level of consumer demand. Smallholder farmers can change processors frequently according to the milk price and services offered, since no contracts link stakeholders. This organization allows smallholder farmers to be involved in the dairy sector but with low profitability. While the informal sector shows better profits per liter of milk than the formal ones, it remains sensitive to the State's willingness to apply stricter quality regulations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Innovation platforms are established to facilitate open communication and collaboration among various actors usually within a value chain to promote collective resource management. The concept of innovation platform as a strategy of entry point for operationalization, validation and dissemination of agricultural technology have received much attention in recent times among researchers in Ghana. However, very limited information exists on the factors that influence willingness of farmers’ participation. The present study identified the factors influencing willingness to participate in innovation platform and also tested the level of agreement among the identified constraints associated with participation using the Probit model and Kendall’s coefficient of concordance respectively. Data for the study was collected from a cross sectional primary observations of 250 smallholder rice farmers in northern Ghana. The study observes, inter alia, that age of household head, household size and household income significantly influenced willingness to participate on the platform. The Kendall’s coefficient of concordance value indicated that there was 21 percent agreement between the rankings of the participation constraints faced by the sampled rice farmers. Income-earning and younger household heads must be targeted coupled with situation of the platforms close to smallholder farmers to encourage participation. © 2014, Martey et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - Background: Several years have passed since the rural New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) in China was established and policies kept continuous improvement. Its policies on chronic diseases vary by county but have certain shared characteristics. Following this modification of medical insurance policy, this study reassesses the provision of insurance against expenditure on chronic diseases in rural areas, and analyzes its effect on impoverishment. Methods. We conducted an empirical study using multi-stage stratified random sampling. We surveyed 1,661 rural households in three provinces and analyzed the responses from 1,525 households that participated in NCMS, using descriptive and logistic regression analysis. Results: The NCMS has reduced the prevalence of poverty and catastrophic health expenditure (CHE), as measured by out-of-pocket (OOP) payments exceeding 40% of total household expenditure, by decreasing medical expenditure. It provides obvious protection to households which include someone with chronic diseases. However, these households continue to face a higher financial risk than those without anyone suffering from chronic diseases. Variables about health service utilization and OOP payment differed significantly between households with or without people suffering from chronic disease. And CHE risk is commonly associated with household income, the number of family members with chronic diseases, OOP payment of outpatient and inpatient service in all three provinces. Conclusion: To reduce CHE risk for these households, it is critical to decrease OOP payments for health services by enhancing the effective reimbursement level of NCMS and strictly regulating the providers' behaviors. We recommend that a combinatory changes should be made to the rural health insurance scheme in China to improve its effect. These include improving the NCMS benefit package by broadening the catalogue of drugs and treatments covered, decreasing or abolishing deductible and increasing the reimbursement ratio of outpatient services for people with chronic diseases, together with expansion of insurance fund, and modifying health providers' behaviors by payment reform. © 2014 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how social network capital may facilitate agricultural household market access in Uganda. Specifically, the paper investigates if social network capital has significant positive effects on the ability of households to receive higher prices for coffee. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, social network capital is modeled using a household utility maximisation problem that is dependent on consumption and social interactions. The authors assume that social network capital mediates economic benefits through its effect on information flow, market intelligence and collective bargaining. The paper uses two-stage least square econometric methods to investigate whether group involvement at the household level helps farmers to access markets with higher prices. Findings - The findings indicate that social network capital, measured in form of density of participation and attendance score, and multiplicative and additive indices of these, have significant positive effects on the ability to receive higher prices for coffee. Research limitations/implications - The authors realise that several weaknesses in the approach could compromise the validity of the findings. These weaknesses include: the cross-sectional nature of the data, the omitted variable bias, the endogeneity concerns of social capital, sample size and the dimensions that the paper choses to capture social network capital. Future research should explore the factors that can help households to engage more in group activities. Practical implications - The findings have important implications for government policy especially in areas of agricultural development and poverty reduction. Specifically, governments should pay close attention to various social groups as they can serve as important channels to achieve better market outcomes, as is the for coffee prices in rural Uganda. Social implications - Many governments in Sub Saharan Africa are constrained to provide basic public goods to the people. This is due to a combination of limited budgets and lack of good leadership. In such circumstances, the people have to rely on their collective/social effort to take advantage of markets opportunities. Such opportunities can be accessed using the existing social structures whose norms and the trust between members permit cooperation. Originality/value - The study contributes to a small but growing empirical literature on social groups and how they can mediate social economic outcomes especially for rural households. The empirical estimations take into consideration the endogeinety concerns associated with social network capital. The paper will be useful for policy makers and researchers who may have a keen interest in the roles that group activities play in agricultural development and poverty reduction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of a household's social capital in the form of community group participation and empirically analyses the roles that social capital plays in helping rural households rebuild productive assets after shocks. Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, social capital is modelled as a household's intensity of group participation measured by the density and active participation in group activities as well as their multiplicative and additive indices. Instrumental variable methods were used to address the problem of endogeneity associated with social capital. Findings – The results indicate that household characteristics such as age, education level, dependence ratio and years of village residence as well as village-level characteristics such as the village population density are critical determinants of social capital. In addition, social capital measured in form of density of participation in group activities and attendance score as well as multiplicative and additive indices of these have significant positive effects on the household ability to rebuild livestock assets. Research limitations/implications – The authors realize that several weakness in the approach could compromise the validity of the findings. These weaknesses include: the cross-sectional nature of the data, the omitted variable bias, the endogeneity concerns of social capital and the identification strategy, sample size and the dimensions the authors chose to measure social capital. Future research should explore the factors that can help households to engage more in-group activities. Practical implications – The findings have important implications for government policy especially in areas of agricultural development and poverty reduction. Specifically, governments should pay close attention to the various social groups as they can serve as important channels to achieve better social economic outcomes, including the accumulation of rural assets, as is the case with livestock assets in rural Uganda. Social implications – Many governments in Sub-Saharan Africa are constrained to provide basic public goods to the people. This is due to a combination of limited budgets and lack of good leadership.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing use of the value chain approach as a strategy to improve smallholder participation in markets. Despite the surge, not much is known about its effectiveness and specificity in the context of lesser known commodities such as non-timber forest products and agroforestry tree products. This paper documents the key lessons learned from the implementation of two major value chain projects related to lesser known species in the Congo basin, specifically in Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Results from the project indicate the importance of combining value chain interventions in the domain of production, harvest and post-harvest, with activities that enhance the organisational and institutional environment, promote effective policies to support the commercialisation process, as well as assessing the impact of the interventions. It is recommended that in order to exploit the benefits of agroforestry value chains, it is important to take advantage of complementarities among value chain interventions, use differentiated strategies in order to reach out to the various target groups, understand the product and country specific issues to design interventions as well as promote effective policy environment that will improve domestication and planting of these species. It is concluded that the value chain approach has the potential to enhance smallholder participation in agroforestry products' markets, thereby improving their livelihoods. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Internationally, there is interest in increasing the trade in green market products, such as organic, fair trade, reduction of deforestation and forest degradation/reduction of deforestation and forest degradation+ for reduced deforestation and mitigation of climate change, and environmental goods and services. This crucially needs to be extended to the many poor, hungry and marginalized smallholder farmers in developing countries. In this context, agroforestry tree domestication has made great progress over the last 20 years, especially in Africa with the emergence of many new tree crops for food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries across many agro-ecological zones. Tree domestication is important for the enhancement of economic returns as value chains from local to global become more sophisticated and demand higher quality, greater uniformity and a regular and continuous supply. Local farmers are now developing cultivars creating direct benefits from the marketing of food and non-food products in local and regional markets. This creates business and employment opportunities in local cottage industries. Likewise, through the indirect environmental and ecological services provided by trees, food security can be greatly enhanced by closing the yield gap (the difference between the potential and actual yield) of modern crop varieties. In this way, agroforestry is adding income generation to agroecological approaches which together reverse the cycle of land degradation and social deprivation and transforming the lives of poor farmers. However, these benefits do not come without some risks from the loss of genetic diversity, local rights over genetic resources and exploitation by unscrupulous entrepreneurs. Agroforestry developments are therefore focusing on better access to green business opportunities for poor smallholder farmers in Africa by maximizing the benefits and minimizing the risks. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The Indian Government's National Biogas and Manure Management Programme (NBMMP) seeks to deliver renewable energy services to households across the country by facilitating the deployment of family-sized (&lt;6m3) anaerobic (biogas) digesters. NBMMP policy is implemented at three levels, from government and state nodal agency, via private contractors to households, creating multiple institutional arrangements. We analysed the scheme in Assam, north-east India, focusing on how policy was implemented across two districts and interviewing stakeholders in rural households, state and non-state institutions. The top-down, supply-side approach to policy enables government to set targets and require individual states to deploy the scheme, which benefits households who can afford to participate. NBMMP delivered improved energy service outcomes to a majority of households, although the level of knowledge and understanding of the technology amongst users was limited. Training and education of householders, and particularly women, is needed in relation to the maintenance of digesters, feedstock suitability and the environmental and potential livelihood benefits of digestate. A revised bottom-up approach to policy, which highlights the contextual and demand-side issues around adopting the technology, may deliver monetary benefits from market competition and enable development of community-focused microfinance schemes to improve the affordability of biogas systems. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether the New Cooperative Medical Insurance Scheme (NCMS) is associated with decreased levels of catastrophic health expenditure and reduced impoverishment due to medical expenses in rural households of China. Methods: An analysis of a national representative sample of 38,945 rural households (129,635 people) from the 2008 National Health Service Survey was performed. Logistic regression models used binary indicator of catastrophic health expenditure as dependent variable, with household consumption, demographic characteristics, health insurance schemes, and chronic illness as independent variables. Results: Higher percentage of households experiencing catastrophic health expenditure and medical impoverishment correlates to increased health care need. While the higher socio-economic status households had similar levels of catastrophic health expenditure as compared with the lowest. Households covered by the NCMS had similar levels of catastrophic health expenditure and medical impoverishment as those without health insurance. Conclusion: Despite over 95% of coverage, the NCMS has failed to prevent catastrophic health expenditure and medical impoverishment. An upgrade of benefit packages is needed, and effective cost control mechanisms on the provider side needs to be considered. © 2014 Li et al.

AB  - Vegetable consumption occupies a very important position in the food consumption of Chinese residents; however,the use of chemical pesticides has a serious impact on vegetable quality and safety. At present,promotion and application of biopesticides have become the most practical ways of improving the quality and safety of agricultural products,including vegetables. Interestingly,in the present study,a survey of 294 vegetable farmer households in Cangshan County,Shandong Province,China demonstrated that 66. 00% ,71. 43% and 69. 05% of the respondents had no knowledge of biopesticides,had never used biopesticides and were skeptical about the effect of biopesticides,respectively. Furtherly,in order to study willingness to adopt biopesticides,this paper supposed that farmers are rational,men,and regarded gender,age,income,education,household vegetable planting area,perceiving hazards of chemical pesticide residues as independent variable. Based on binary logistic regression model exists the problem of bias and separation,this paper introduced penalized binary logistic regression model. The results produced by the penalized binary logistic regression model revealed that vegetable farmer households with individual characteristics such as the inclusion of female( s) ,under the age of 40,perceiving hazards of chemical pesticide residues and with 9 years of education or above,as well as household characteristics such as with a household vegetable planting area of less than 5 mu ( 0. 33 ha) ,with a non-agricultural income of 30,000 yuan or above and participating in agricultural cooperatives are more willing to use biopesticides. Thus,the driving force of government subsidies and pesticide application skill training provided by the government are insufficient at increasing vegetable farmers'willingness to adopt biopesticides. These findings bear a wealth of policy implications for policy decision-making,the government should promote biopesticides by means of agricultural cooperative organizations,increase efforts to support biopesticide application,and guide the agricultural cooperative organizations in focusing on building sales networks for high-quality agricultural products and related works.

AB  - There is lack of consensus in the literature on the impact of contract farming on the welfare of smallholder farmers. Some authors argue that contact farming improves access to markets hence income, while others view contract farming as an avenue by which large corporations exploit smallholder farmers. It is hence seen as a blessing to some but a necessary evil to others. This study examines the factors influencing participation in poultry contract farming in Kenya. It then uses propensity score matching technique to assess the impact of contract poultry production. The study finds, among others, that farmer-specific factors, transaction costs and financial asset endowment affect participation in contract farming. It also finds that contracted farmers earned more net income per bird than their counterparts. It concludes that participation in contract farming practice improves the welfare smallholder poultry farmers in Kenya. The study discusses the policy implications of the findings.

AB  - Several studies have shown that traditional vegetables have high market potential and contribute substantially to household incomes and nutrition. Until recently however, the scientific and donor community often give less attention to research on traditional vegetable crop value chains. The resurgence of traditional vegetables' importance in human nutrition is accompanied by a need to understand the interactions among various actors in their value chain to determine ways to add value to produce and improve marketing efficiency. Based on a multistage cross-sectional survey of 240 respondents in Malawi and Mozambique, this study employed participatory evaluation and market research to identify potential outlets and target crops, and define value chain processes, including choice of market outlets and mode of farmer-buyer linkages. Traditional vegetable sales contributed about 35% and 30% of smallholders' income in Malawi and Mozambique respectively. Linkages between value chain actors were found to be weak; mostly based on spot market transactions, except for those between retailers and supermarkets, which were based on relationship marketing. © 2014 International Food and Agribusiness Management Association (IFAMA).

AB  - Many observers view Jatropha as a miracle plant that grows in harsh environments, halts land degradation and provides seeds for fuel production. This makes it particularly attractive for use in Ethiopia, where poverty levels are high and the degradation of agricultural land is widespread. In this article, we investigate the potentials and limitations of a government-initiated Jatropha project for smallholders in northeastern Ethiopia from a green economy perspective. Data are based on a 2009 household survey and interviews with key informants, as well as on a 2012 follow-up round of interviews with key informants. We conclude that the project has not contributed to a greener economy so far, but has the potential to do so in the future. To maximize Jatropha's potential, interventions must focus mainly on smallholders and pay more attention to the entire biofuel value chain. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Contractual arrangements between farmers and traders aiming at providing input/credit in return for output selling have been widely studied in the literature on agricultural economics. Nonetheless, there is one issue, which is barely mentioned in the literature: how to enforce the contract terms when traders offer credit in cash rather than input advances? This article aims to describe an innovation in farming contracts, used by fresh fruit and vegetable wholesalers in Turkey, which involves a kind of private voucher system. Drawing on original data collected from wholesalers-a segment in the supply chain hardly covered in the literature-we investigate the factors determining contract adoption using a two-limit Tobit model. Our results suggest that this private voucher system contributes to supply chain coordination and facilitates smallholder farmer participation in export and supermarket channels, which are growing rapidly in this developing country. © 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

AB  - This paper assesses how tenure reform in China's collective forest sector affects Chinese farmer households' perception of tenure security and propensity to invest in their forestland. A large database consisting of information from 3,180 households in eight provinces from south to north is used to explore factors correlated with more strongly perceived tenure security and determinants of forest-related investment. The study adds to the limited research testing whether there is endogenous causality between investment and tenure security in forestland, and finds that investment was not undertaken to enhance tenure security. In addition, the data allow for differentiation between perceived tenure security and contracted use and transferability rights. Overall, stronger contracted rights were found to affect investment. China's forest tenure reform - where individual households can manage forestland, empowered by legal certification and stronger contract rights - has thus enhanced tenure security and encouraged forest investment. © 2013 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Millions of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia benefit from readily available and affordable irrigation technologies. The rapid uptake of small private irrigation in South Asia had a proven positive effect on poverty alleviation. In sub-Saharan Africa similar trends are emerging and several studies point to considerable upscaling potential. Achieving this potential would substantially boost smallholder incomes and food security. However, the spread of small private irrigation poses several challenges related to equity, efficiency, and sustainability. Women and resource poor farmers face challenges accessing affordable technologies; market inefficiencies and policy frameworks negatively affect farmer decision-making and technology access; and the unregulated spread of private irrigation may lead to over-abstraction, pollution, and conflicts. In this paper we argue that carefully designed intervention strategies and policy engagement are needed for two reasons. First, there is a need to address potential adverse effects of the ongoing, unregulated spread of small private irrigation while safeguarding its proven benefits on food security and poverty alleviation. Second, relatively straightforward measures can extend the benefits to a broader group of smallholders, including women and the poor, while at the same time ensuring sustainable use of the resource. Based on empirical evidence from case studies in six countries, we identified four elements of such an approach: (1) enhancing technology access; (2) catalyzing smallholder value chains; (3) fostering supportive policies; and (4) strengthening institutional capacity to manage potential trade-offs at the watershed scale. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper builds on work from the agrarian change and political ecology literatures to analyze the process of agrarian change among smallholder cotton farmers in southwestern Burkina Faso. Specifically, we use a rural survey of 72 heads of household in three villages to examine whether and how (1) access to agricultural inputs, (2) debt and (3) liberalization reforms combine to produce rural socioeconomic differentiation based on wealth. We find that wealthier farmers use more mineral fertilizer and manure inputs than their poorer counterparts. Wealthier farmers are also better able to remain debt-free as cotton prices drop and input prices rise. Moreover, they are able to take advantage of the neo-liberal restructuring of cotton cooperatives to change polices on debt repayment and input provisioning to their favor. This growing divide has large implications for rural food security, particularly as land becomes scarcer, fallows disappear and the need to intensify production grows. This research addresses two gaps in the agrarian change literature in relating how liberalization reforms and biophysical elements drive rural socio-economic differentiation. This work also shows that merging the concerns of political ecology with the agrarian change literature allows for a deeper examination of rural socioeconomic differentiation. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Traditional food systems offer a key link between the social and economic resilience of smallholder farmers and pastoralists and the sustainable food and nutrition security of global populations. This paper addresses issues related to socio-cultural diversity and the continuing complex engagement of traditional and modern communities with the plants and animals that sustain them. In light of some of the unhealthful consequences of the 'nutrition transition' to globalized modern diets, the authors define and propose a process for a more successful food system transition that balances agro-biodiversity and processed commodities to support diet diversity, health and social equity alongside sustainable economic growth. We review empirical research in support of practice and policy changes in agriculture, economic development and health domains as well as cross-sectoral and community-based innovation. High-value food crops within domestic and global value chains can be an entry point for smallholders' participation as contributors and beneficiaries of development, while sustainable small farms, as purveyors of environmental and public health services, diversify global options for long-term adaptation in the face of environmental uncertainty. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - There is considerable controversy about the impact of biofuels on food security in developing countries. A major concern is that biofuels reduce food security by increasing food prices. In this paper we use survey evidence to assess the impact of castor production on poor and food insecure rural households in Ethiopia. About 1/3 of poor farmers have allocated on average 15% of their land to the production of castor beans under contract in biofuel supply chains. Castor production significantly improves their food security: they have fewer months without food and the amount of food they consume increases. Castor cultivation is beneficial for participating households' food security in several ways: by generating cash income from castor contracts, they can store food for the lean season; castor beans preserve well on the field which allows sales when farmers are in need of cash (or food); spillover effects of castor contracts increases the productivity of food crops. Increased food crop productivity offsets the amount of land used for castor so that the total local food supply is not affected. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Payments for environmental services (PES) are often promoted on the basis of a purported win-win scenario in terms of accomplishing dual environmental and social policy objectives. Yet, it has been observed that PES programs tend to exclude small land-owners due to relatively high and largely scale-independent transaction costs. This study seeks to shed light on the role of local intermediaries in PES programs and how they may bring the reality of PES closer to the win-win scenario. This is done through an investigation of three intermediaries in the Costa Rican PES program; an NGO, a producer cooperative, and a county agricultural center. Based on interviews, household surveys, and reviews of PES contracts, the study examines differences in the inclusion of small-holders in the PES program between the three organizations and focuses on understanding the underlying reasons for any observed differences. The results reveal that the cooperative and the agricultural center are more inclusive of small-holders than the NGO. The ability to include small-holders is influenced by the organizations' level of running operational costs, but also by their pre-existing portfolio of activities and relationships with landowners, as well as the land development history of the local area. Finally, the role of intermediaries is highly influenced by the framing of their working conditions by the PES program. This study thus shows the importance of considering the factors that condition the role of intermediaries in securing inclusive and low-cost provision of ES. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Maize is the most important food staple in Eastern and Southern Africa, with a highly seasonal production but relatively constant consumption over the year. Farmers have to store maize to bridge seasons, for food security and to protect against price fluctuations. However, the traditional storage methods do not protect grain well, resulting in large postharvest losses. Hermetically sealed metal silos kill storage pests by oxygen deprivation without pesticides. Popular in Central America, they are now being promoted in Africa, but their impact here has not yet been studied. This study used propensity score matching to evaluate the impact of metal silos on duration of maize storage, loss abatement, cost of storage, and household food security. Metal silo adopters (N=116) were matched with non-adopting farmers from a representative sample of 1340 households covering the major maize-growing zones in Kenya. The major effect of the metal silos was an almost complete elimination of losses due to insect pests, saving farmers an average of 150-200. kg of grain, worth KSh9750 (US®130). Metal silo adopters also spent about KSh340 less on storage insecticides. Adopters were able to store their maize for 1.8-2.4. months longer, and to sell their surplus after five months at good prices, instead of having to sell right after the harvest. The period of inadequate food provision among adopters was reduced by more than one month. We conclude that metal silos are effective in reducing grain losses due to maize-storage insects, and that they have a large impact on the welfare and food security of farm households. The initial cost of metal silos is high (KSh20,000/1.8 ton) and therefore policies to increase access to credit, to reduce the cost of sheet metal, and to promote collective action can improve their uptake by smallholder farmers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this article we examine which farmers would be early entrants into weather-index insurance markets in Ethiopia, were such markets to develop on a large scale. We do this by examining the determinants of willingness to pay for weather insurance among 1,400 Ethiopian households that have been tracked for 15 years as part of the Ethiopian Rural household Survey. This provides both historical and current information with which to assess the determinants of demand. We find that educated, wealthier individuals are more likely to purchase insurance. Risk aversion is associated with low insurance take-up suggesting that models of technology adoption can inform the purchase and spread of weather index insurance. We also assess how willingness to pay varied as two key characteristics of the contract were varied and found that basis risk reduces demand for insurance particularly when the price of the contract is high, and that provision of insurance through groups is preferred by female headed households and individuals with lower levels of education. © 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

AB  - Collective marketing is a proven strategy to improve market access for small-scale producers and reduce poverty through increased income. In this study, four groups of smallholders in Honduras and Nicaragua were studied to explore whether indicators of social capital can be used to predict success in setting up collective marketing. A baseline assessment of the groups' social capital endowments during the pre-marketing phase is compared with their marketing success after two years. Results show that the groups' different initial levels of social capital were not directly linked with market success. All groups built up relevant social capital during the establishment phase with external support, although some members left the groups. For determining how to provide support to emerging group marketing, the commonly used measures for social capital to predict success are therefore not sufficient. Additional indicators are needed - such as access to assets and start-up skills of members - for assessing the capacity of groups for continuous construction of social capital in a dynamic process.

AB  - This paper analyses the impact of individual farmers participation in the National Smallholder Farmers Association of Malawi (NASFAM). Precisely the paper analyses the effect of participation on credit market access, fertilizer use and total incomes of its participants in the Kasungu district of Malawi. NASFAM is a form of producer cooperative with a number of socio-economic functions. Using data on income per capita, fertilizer expenditure and access to credit, this paper tests the hypothesis that participation in NASFAM positively impacted incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition. Employing Propensity Score Matching methodology to estimate Average Treatment Effects (ATT) on programme members, this paper finds evidence that participation in NASFAM had a positive effect on all the endogenous variables. Membership enhances household level incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition and is hence in line with national goals of poverty reduction, the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) principles, the SADC's Regional Indicative Strategy Development Plan (RISDP) and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Based on these findings and the fact that credit and fertilizer access are still problematic in Malawi's rural areas, it appears that there is great need for NASFAM to expand to areas where it currently does not have activities. Such expansion would ensure food security over a wider range of rural households through improved input access. © 2013 Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.

AB  - Coffee and banana are important cash and food crops in Uganda and the surrounding East African highland region. Production is dominated by smallholders that have limited arable land and often coffee and banana are intercropped. No significant research and development efforts have been undertaken over the last few decades on this coffee/banana intercropping system. Because recent studies suggest that this system could be a practice with high benefits to the farmers, we decided to study the perceptions of stakeholders along the coffee value chain starting with farmers. Perception analysis based on open-ended interviews following interview guides revealed that a major limitation for the sustainability of this system was poor soil fertility conditions. Perceptions on the benefits of intercropping differed little among coffee actors; that is, banana intercropping provides additional food and income from smallholders' limited land and helps farmers reduce risks related to drought, pest/disease attacks and coffee price volatility. However, farmers' desire to minimize risks does not match the objective of stakeholders higher up the coffee value chain to maximize coffee production. Furthermore, research by public institutes, both national and international, is primarily organized for single crops and not systems. We conclude that the institutional setting of the coffee sector hampers the promotion of intercropping, despite the benefits for the farmer. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Building on African migration as a household survival strategy; urban-rural linkages as critical for migrants' continued engagement with origin communities; reintegration in case of return; and safety net for supplementing precarious urban incomes; we examine the role of family ties in rural origin linkages among 1,693 older migrants living in Nairobi informal settlements. Despite the grim of slum residence, 80% of older migrants in Nairobi slums maintained contact with their rural origin homes during a full year of observation. Family-related factors, especially members of the nuclear family residing in rural origin, explained 45% of explained linkages. Religion, ethnicity, land ownership at origin, and current health and economic statuses are other key predictors. The patterns and reasons of linkages are consistent with migrants' positive contributions to the upkeep of rural origin households. Our findings are well-anchored in the larger continental literature that has shown the urban migrant as not a 'disembedded individual' but instead part of rural origin collectives. Against the weakness of state safety net system, the study sheds crucial light on the enduring importance of sociocultural networks in people's everyday lives, particularly the importance of family ties for older migrants. To the extent that poor health status, being aged 60years or older, and long duration of residence in the slums, which are predictors of low propensities to maintain contacts with rural origin, are also indicators of diminished social engagement, policy interventions among the urban poor may need to include efforts to enhance rural origin reintegration of the most-aged individuals. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Launched in 2001, the Thailand Village and Urban Community Fund (VF) provided almost US$2. billion - a million baht for each of Thailand's 78,000 villages and wards - to provide working capital for locally-run rotating credit associations. Using data from the Thailand Socioeconomic Surveys of 2002 and 2004, we find that VF borrowers were disproportionately poor and agricultural. A fixed effects model using a panel of rural households for these years finds that VF borrowing is associated with, on average, 3.5% more current spending, and 1.4% more income; very similar impacts are found using a propensity score matching model applied to nationwide data in 2004, which also found that VF loans are associated with the acquisition of more durable goods. By way of contrast, borrowing from the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives appears to have a stronger effect on income than on expenditures. The evidence also shows that the effect on expenditure (or income) of VF borrowing is strongest at the lower quantiles, and flowed disproportionately to low-income households; in both of these senses it is " pro-poor" © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In developing countries, smallholder poultry production contributes to food security and poverty alleviation in rural areas. However, traditional poultry marketing chains have been threatened by the epidemics caused by the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1) virus.The article presents a value chain analysis conducted on the traditional poultry marketing chain in the rural province of Phitsanulok, Thailand. The analysis is based on quantitative data collected on 470 backyard chicken farms, and on qualitative data collected on 28 poultry collectors, slaughterhouses and market retailers, using semi-structured interviews. The article examines the organization of poultry marketing chains in time and space, and shows how this may contribute to the spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 in the small-scale poultry sector. The article also discusses the practices and strategies developed by value chain actors facing poultry mortality, with their economic and social determinants. More broadly, this study also illustrates how value chain analysis can contribute to a better understanding of the complex mechanisms associated with the spread of epidemics in rural communities. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Peach palm (Bactris gasipaes) is a multi-purpose palm tree native to tropical Latin America, which is predominantly cultivated by smallholders in agroforestry systems. The fruits are rich in starch and contribute importantly to food security and the cash income of farmers who cultivate them. Complex value chains have emerged that link producers to consumers, but irregular product quality and market chain inequalities undermine the economic well-being of producers and retailers. Peach palm is genetically diverse, but screening for traits of commercial and nutritional interest is required to enhance the use of its genetic resources. Alliances between public organizations and private enterprises are needed to realize the potential for processing novel products from peach palm, especially in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic sectors. The diverse challenges that emerge at different stages of production, processing and marketing require participatory research that directly involves stakeholders from the beginning. © 2012 The Author(s).

Our analysis indicates that cooperative members are more likely to be male-headed households, have better access to agricultural extension services, possess oxen, participate in off-farm work, and have leadership experience. We also found that geographic location and age of household head are strongly associated with cooperative membership. Our estimation results show that cooperative membership has a strong positive impact on fertilizer adoption. The impact on adoption of pesticides turns out to be statistically significant when only agricultural cooperatives are considered. Further analysis also suggests that cooperative membership has a heterogeneous impact on fertilizer adoption among its members. The results suggest that cooperatives can play an important role in accelerating the adoption of agricultural technologies by smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper analyses the role of 'clustering' as a form of cooperative production to improve the environmental performance of shrimp farmers and facilitating them to upgrade their position in the global value chain. Comparing intensive and extensive shrimp farmer clusters in Ca Mau province, Vietnam, we explore how this form of cooperative production can enable small-holders to upgrade both functional and relational dimensions of production to meet new requirements for participation in the global shrimp value chain. The results show that by facilitating horizontal coordination between producers clusters can improve the management capacity of both intensive and extensive producers for meeting international production standards. However, the success of clusters also depends on the type and strength of vertical coordination with other actors along the value chain for both the provision of inputs and marketing of outputs. The paper concludes that for improved extensive shrimp farmer clusters to take further advantage of production-oriented quality standards the Vietnamese government needs to play a greater role in the development of production infrastructure and create a legal framework for private sector-led cluster formation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Since the early 2000s, the governments in ASEAN (the Association of South East Asian Nations) countries have developed 'good agricultural practices' (GAP) as public approaches to field-level quality assurance. Besides the primary goals of consumer food safety and quality assurance, these public GAP programs aim to support small-scale farmer inclusion in mainstream markets. This goal represents the antithesis of the prevailing trend that private GAP approaches have tightened integration with resourceful, large-scale producers in global value chains. This paper examines the compatibility of the goals of safety assurance and social justice in a public GAP approach through comparative analysis of Thailand's Q-GAP between two local contexts of fruit production and marketing. The research findings suggest that while the public GAP scheme could draw the participation of a broad cohort of local small-scale producers and serve to certify their production, its impact on changing producers' on-field practices and catalyzing their access to the global market through food safety assurance is limited. The binding factors include the lack of producers' understanding of the principles of the programme, limited additional economic merits for them, and the influence of extra-local market forces that stress economies of size and food quality rather than food safety. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper discusses a methodology to model precipitation indices and premium prices for index-based drought insurance for smallholders. Spatial basis risk, which is borne by the insured, is a problem, especially in variable topography. Also, site-specific drought risk needs to be estimated accurately in order to offer effective insurance cover and ensure financial sustainability of the insurance scheme. We explore farmers' perceptions on drought and spatial climate variability and draw conclusions concerning basis risk with regards to the proposed methodology. There are technically many options to represent natural heterogeneity in index insurance contracts while serving the customer adequately and keeping transaction costs low. © 2012 Kost et al.

AB  - Local communities in central Brazil harvest buriti palm (Mauritia flexuosa) fruit from swamp forests as well as using them for agriculture and cattle and pig farming. This study describes the intensity of forest use by buriti fruit harvesters and identifies how their socioeconomic conditions influence resource use. We visited 75 swamp forests where buriti fruits are harvested and interviewed the head of the nearest household. Agriculture was practiced in 72 % of forests and cattle farming in 52 %. For almost half (48 %) of households agriculture and buriti fruit harvest were the main sources income. Forests resources were equally important to all socioeconomic classes, even richer farmers. The intensity of fruit harvest did not differ between collective and private use regimes of forests. Market access was a limitation to fruit harvest intensity. The high intensity of swamp forest use suggests that their conservation will require change to current management practices. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - This paper explores welfare dynamics among households in rural Mozambique. Using household panel data, we test whether an asset-based poverty trap exists. Findings indicate that all rural households converge to one stable equilibrium in the medium term, which is close to the poverty line. This may indicate that households in rural Mozambique are collectively trapped in generalized underdevelopment. A drought and household coping strategies help to explain the observed poverty dynamics. Food-insecure households who have better access to income-generating opportunities and who can afford drawing on unproductive assets are able to sustain their productive asset base in the short term. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper analyses the shifting role of South African farmers, agribusiness and capital elsewhere in the Southern African region and the rest of the continent. It explores recent trends in this expansion, and investigates the interests and agendas shaping such deals, and the ideologies and discourses of legitimation employed in favour of them. While for the past two decades small numbers of South African farmers have moved to Mozambique, Zambia and several other countries, this trend seems to be undergoing both a quantitative and a qualitative shift. Whereas in the past their migration was largely individual or in small groups, now it is being more centrally organised and coordinated, is more frequently taking the form of large concessions for newly formed consortia and agribusinesses, and is increasingly reliant on external financing through transnational partnerships. By early 2010, the commercial farmers' association Agri South Africa (AgriSA) was engaged in negotiations for land acquisitions with the governments of 22 African countries. This essay is the product of a scoping study to document and analyse major land acquisitions by South African farmers and agribusinesses, and the processes through which these have occurred and are occurring. It considers the changing character, scale and location of South African investments elsewhere in the region and the continent, and focuses specifically on the AgriSA-Congo deal (the largest deal concluded thus far), and acquisitions by the two South African sugar giants, Illovo and Tongaat-Hulett, for outgrower and estate expansion elsewhere in the region. The study addresses the degree to which South Africa is no longer merely exporting its farmers, but also its value chains, to the rest of the continent - and what this means for trajectories of agrarian change. It questions how we might understand the growing trend of 'intra-regional land grabbing' and, in the cases discussed, suggests that South African-based companies are acting as arteries of global capital. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Foreign investment in agricultural land acquisition in sub-Saharan Africa has been viewed primarily as driven by a set of linked 'crises': in financial capital markets, in security of energy and food supply, and in global environmental governance. This paper argues that a focus on the 'buyers' of land risks overlooking the dynamics that operate on the side of the land 'sellers'. Accordingly, the first part of the paper argues that it is important to view the current 'land grab' as the latest stage in a longer historical process of competition for control of land and other natural resources by different 'domestic' economic and political actors within African countries. While such struggles are often characterised as the 'state versus the peasantry', with the state acting on behalf of 'urban elites', the paper argues that processes of accumulation and associated enclosure of natural resources need to be examined more critically in specific contexts if the role and impact of foreign capital investment are to be understood. The second part of the paper seeks to identify the ways in which questions of scale (in the sense of greater capital intensity) can be considered to be constraints to the development of African agriculture. Particularly, it considers the extent to which the production models most frequently mentioned in connection with foreign investment (large-scale mechanised farms and small-scale outgrower contract farming) respond to current productivity constraints. The paper argues that current debates about foreign investment in agricultural land underplay the importance of water resources needed to overcome production risks associated with irregular rainfall. Bringing the water dimension of land deals more clearly into focus is necessary if the scope for positive and negative impacts of new investment on existing land users is to be fully understood. The paper concludes by considering the implications of such challenges in the current context of foreign investment in agriculture in Africa. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Contract farming is widely perceived as a means of increasing welfare in developing countries. Because of smallholder self-selection in contract farming, however, it is not clear whether contract farming actually increases grower welfare. In an effort to improve upon existing estimates of the welfare impacts of contract farming, this paper uses the results of a contingent-valuation experiment to control for unobserved heterogeneity among smallholders. Using data across several regions, firms, and crops in Madagascar, results indicate that a 1-percent increase in the likelihood of participating in contract farming is associated with a 0.5-percent increase in household income, among other positive impacts. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper addresses the extent to which the scope of smallholder cooperatives' activities may affect their performance in marketing their members' surplus output. Previous papers have highlighted such effects and explained it by the extra burden that diversified activities impose on the often limited management capacities of these organisations. We propose an alternative explanation, linking the scope of activities to membership structure: marketing cooperatives engaging in a vast array of unrelated activities may lose their marketing-oriented members for those more interested in the new activities proposed. The model's predictions are supported by recently collected data on 172 smallholder grain marketing cooperatives in Ethiopia. Implications for the support of farmer organisations are derived and discussed in conclusion. © The author 2012.

AB  - Purpose: New approaches to extension service delivery are needed that stimulate increased agricultural production, contribute to collective action and which also foster the emergence of agricultural innovation systems. Research in Peru and Mexico explores some of these new approaches. Design/methodology/approach: In both countries, a qualitative value chain mapping methodology was used to explore the challenges of providing extension provision to resource-poor farmers in ways that stimulate collective action and agricultural innovation systems. Findings: In Peru, collective action and the development of an agriculture innovation system required the network broker activities of initially a non-governmental organization (NGO) and then increasingly trusted local farmers known as Kamayoq. In Mexico, collective action took place in the context of a linear transfer-of-technology approach focused on access to improved maize seed and there was no evidence of the emergence of innovation networks. Practical implications: Different extension modalities can foster collective action but this in itself is not enough to encourage innovation. Extension needs to focus on combining collective action with networking amongst sets of heterogeneous value chain actors. Originality/value: The Peruvian and Mexican case studies demonstrate that the debate about the modalities of pluralistic and diversified extension systems has obscured the reality that the development community still has some way to go to achieve comprehensively the paradigm shift from a linear transfer-of-technology approach to one that supports the emergence of agricultural innovation systems. © 2012 Wageningen University.

AB  - Eucalypt (Eucalyptus spp.) tree farming is a source of income for many smallholders in developing and emerging countries and critical to the resource supply of many pulp and paper companies. These companies rely on smallholders adopting tree farming, sometimes by offering a contract. This paper reports a study from four regions of Thailand, where smallholder eucalypt tree farming is important, which investigated what characteristics of smallholders were associated with greater adoption of tree farming. A total of 461 eucalypt tree farmers and 171 non-tree farmers were randomly selected and surveyed in these regions, using a door-to-door household survey. A logit analysis corroborated hypotheses about the drivers of adoption. Qualitative analyses were used to inform interpretation of the quantitative results and shed light on the role of eucalypt tree farming in smallholders' livelihood. Results demonstrate that those with suitable land available are more likely to adopt eucalypt tree farming than others. In addition, perception of land tenure security matters in the adoption of tree growing, but holding a formal land tenure document does not. Adoption of eucalypt tree farming in Thailand is not part of a land use intensification strategy. Instead, eucalypts are used as an alternative crop for low productivity land, on which eucalypts are the most profitable crop. Eucalypt tree farming also gives smallholders an opportunity to diversify their income. In addition, this alternative land use has the advantage of requiring low labour inputs between planting and harvest. This is particularly advantageous for many tree growers who have off-farm income or rely on hired labour for farming their land. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The study examined the functioning of the smallholder-produced teak poles value chain in Southern Benin from an analytical perspective combining the governance structure, the institutional environment, and the distribution of consumer price among chain actors. The objective was to identify bottlenecks militating against improved functioning of the farm-grown timber value chains. A fieldwork was carried from August 2008 to September 2010, to identify the agents and the organisations involved in the value chain. Data were collected on the functions performed, the costs borne and the income received by each category of agent, the marketing channels within the value chain, the interactions among agents, the consumption of the product, and the role of the organisations connected to the value chain. This was done by combining semi-structured interviews, focus group meetings, and structured interviews. In addition, data were collected on the institutional environment from both primary and secondary sources. The following agents were involved in the value chain: nurserymen, planters, local intermediaries, brokers, traders, and consumers. The forest service was the main governmental organisation involved in the functioning of the value chain. The governance structure in the value chain was driven by a mixture of government and the market. Various weaknesses were found in the forest policy, the forest regulation and their implementation. Planters' share of consumer price was lower than traders' return. The relevant policy options to address these issues were discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - While natural resource dependency has been a feature of the Chilean economy for decades, its influence on Chilean society remains underexplored. This research analyzes data from a nationally representative survey of Chilean households to understand the implications of household and residential dependency on natural resources for children's school attendance and work. Descriptive results indicate that collectively children of household heads employed in agriculture, forestry, fishing, or mining are less likely than others to attend school and more likely to cite problems of access to schools and economic difficulties as reasons for not attending school. They also are more likely to work, help at home, or engage in other idle activities than attend school. Multivariate hierarchical models suggest that observed disadvantages are largely accounted for by lower levels of parental education and by the location of households in rural, isolated, and impoverished locales. Important differences across natural resource industries are observed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Most studies of tenurial insecurity focus on its effects on investment. This paper studies the hitherto unexplored relationship between tenurial insecurity and land tenancy contracts. Based on distinct features of formal law and customary rights in Madagascar, this paper augments the canonical model of sharecropping by making the strength of the landlord's property right increasing in the amount of risk she bears within the contract. Using data on landlords' subjective perceptions in rural Madagascar, empirical tests support the hypothesis that insecure property rights drive contract choice but offer little support in favor of the canonical risk sharing hypothesis. © 2012 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.

AB  - The cultivation of indigenous and exotic fruits for sub-Saharan Africa's domestic markets can bring increased revenues for smallholders and improve the diets of local consumers. There are, however, many bottlenecks which need to be addressed so that wider benefits from such activities are realised. Here, we describe key interventions being taken to address current constraints. For indigenous fruit trees, it is necessary to set priorities for which species to promote and to engage in participatory domestication for the improvement of yield, quality and germplasm delivery to farmers. For exotic fruits, 'south-south' transfer of advanced cultivars and the development of small-scale commercial suppliers of planting material are required to reinvigorate production. For both indigenous and exotic species, a focus on improving market value chains to bring greater benefits to producers is needed. We describe where further work is required to increase efficiency in the sector and to favour smallholder involvement.

AB  - Summary This paper analyses the organization of the rice seed sector in Guinea with the overall objectives to assess how organizational settings affect seed supply to small-scale farmers and to suggest institutional changes that would favour seed service and uptake of varieties. Data were collected in Guinea, West Africa, using focus group discussions with extension workers, farmers, representatives of farmers" associations, agro-input dealers, researchers and non-governmental organization (NGO) staff, and surveys of 91 rice farming households and 41 local seed dealers. Findings suggest that the current institutional settings and perceptions of stakeholders from the formal seed sector inhibit smallholder farmers" access to seed. Seed interventions in the past two decades have mainly relied on the national extension system, the research institute, NGOs, farmers" associations and contract seed producers to ensure seed delivery. Although local seed dealers play a central role in providing seed to farmers, governmental organizations operating in a linear model of formal seed sector development have so far ignored their role. We discuss the need to find common ground and alternative models of seed sector development. In particular we suggest the involvement of local seed dealers in seed development activities to better link the formal and the informal seed systems and improve smallholder farmers" access to seed from the formal sector. © Cambridge University Press 2011.

AB  - The lack of efficient individual solutions for small farmers either in the market or through the State has resulted in a search for collective spaces to strengthen their productive capacities, where participation in organizations emerges as a relevant factor to obtain higher efficiency levels. The aims of this study were to analyze the determinants of technical efficiency of wheat small farmers in Bío Bío Region (Chile) and to evaluate its relation to a variety of variables, including farmer participation in organizations, for several territories with different agro-climatic conditions. Using information from the VII Agricultural and Forestry Survey, a stochastic frontier production function was estimated. The results show that age, education, farm size, degree of specialization and dependence of activity explain individual technical efficiency levels. Participation in cooperatives and gremial associations is also related to higher technical efficiency levels, especially in territories characterized for a lower wheat productive vocation.

AB  - The small scale forestry carbon project in Haryana, India has been registered as a Clean Development Project (CDM) activity and is the first such projects from India. Developed under the Kyoto Protocol of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the projects aims at restoring heavily degraded sandune affected private lands and contribute to climate change mitigation. The project is expected to sequester 234,584 tons of carbon dioxide (tCO2) in 20 years project cycle with an average annual sequestration of 11,729 (tCO2) per year. The project is expected to have a total carbon stock of 385,253.1 ton Carbon (tC) in the project life span of 20 years as against 7,920.6 (tC) in the baseline scenario. The carbon credits earned from the project is supposed to provide additional incentives to the smallholders who have formed a cooperative society for this purpose. This paper addresses the issues and challenges in developing the project activity and also discusses the lessons learned in the process. The project is supposed to help in poverty alleviation and has become a success story for rehabilitating degraded lands in semi arid regions of India through plantation forestry. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Irrigation management transfer (IMT) is an important strategy among donors and governments that aims to strengthen farmer control over water and irrigation infrastructure. In this study, we use data from a survey of 68 irrigator associations (IAs) and 1020 farm households in the Philippines to examine the impact of IMT on irrigation association performance and on rice yields. We find that the presence of IMT is associated with an increase in maintenance activities undertaken by irrigation associations. While associations with and without IMT contracts undertake canal maintenance, the frequency of maintenance in IMT IAs is higher. IMT presence is also associated with an increase in farm yields by about 6%; rice production in IMT areas is higher even after we control for various differences amongst rice farmers in IMT and non-IMT areas. Finally, IMT may even give poorer farmers a small boost in terms of rice yields. We speculate that this boost may be a result of improved water delivery and better resolution of conflicts related to illegal use. © IWA Publishing 2010.

AB  - This paper examines the agricultural science needs of small farms. The green revolution successfully negotiated two tightropes: agricultural productivity increases were larger than the fall in prices that resulted from producing more food; and output per hectare rose faster than output per worker, thus increasing the demand for labor. The current challenge is to generate technology that helps poor farmers in low potential areas. Since research capacity is increasingly private, incentives to produce the needed technology are needed, perhaps through contracts to produce varieties with specific characteristics. Development of seeds needs complementary work on water, for which economists, plant scientists, and engineers need to pool their skills. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper estimates the determinants of farmers' decisions to join a rural producer organisation, the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi (NASFAM), in Kasungu District. Data for the study were collected in June and August 2003 using household-level questionnaires and stratified random sampling, where strata were membership status and gender. Probit analysis of 250 farmers shows that off-farm sources of income, distance of the farmer's household from Kasungu District centre, age of the farmer, tobacco farming, education, household level land holding and gender determined the decision to join NASFAM. These results suggest that farmers should be informed of the potential benefits of participating in rural development efforts, and that rural communication and information infrastructure should be improved so as to reduce the costs of information access and transactions in general, if participation in organisations such as NASFAM is to be enhanced. © 2010 Development Bank of Southern Africa.

AB  - Based on three case studies in China and Brazil, this paper explores the terms of access for farmers' participation in certified organic agriculture (OA) and investigates the influence of adoption on productivity, nutrient budgets, income and labour use. Small-scale farmers converting to OA require substantial external production-related, marketing and certification support. Access to OA was strongly dependent upon the type of support available to farmers. Organization based on a contract-farming model resulted in OA only being an option available to a narrow group of farmers, whilst OA initiated by a farmer cooperative provided better access. Gross output was significantly higher for oranges, whilst for the other crops gross output was similar. However, organic farmers in China felt that adoption had improved prices, incomes and market access. Farmers' perception of improved incomes is probably due to improved market access coupled with either a large production base, production intensification and production diversification. This study demonstrates that organization of farmers, and the manner in which this is structured, is crucial for external support to have an effect. Thus, OA may be a development path for small farmers if the supporting structures are provided at a small financial interest rate. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present paper investigates pesticide application types adopted by smallholder potato producers in the Department of Boyacá, Colombia. In this region, environmental, health and adverse economic effects due to pesticide mis- or over-use respectively have been observed. Firstly, pesticide application types were identified based on input-effectiveness. Secondly, their determinants of adoption were investigated. Finally suggestions were given to develop intervention options for transition towards a more sustainable pesticide use. Three application types were identified for fungicide and insecticide. The types differed in terms of input (intensity of pesticide application), effect (damage control), frequency of application, average quantity applied per application, chemical class, and productivity. Then, the determinants of different pesticide application types were investigated with a multinomial logistic regression approach and applying the integrative agent centred (IAC) framework. The area of the plot, attendance at training sessions and educational and income levels were among the most relevant determinants. The analysis suggested that better pesticide use could be fostered to reduce pesticide-related risks in the region. Intervention options were outlined, which may help in targeting this issue. They aim not only at educating farmers, but to change their social and institutional context, by involving other agents of the agricultural system (i.e. pesticide producers), facilitating new institutional settings (i.e. cooperatives) and targeting social dynamics (i.e. conformity to social norms). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA) is often perceived to provide " win-win" outcomes for farmers leading to reduced erosion and off-site sedimentation, as well as improved soil fertility and productivity. However, adoption rates for CA in many regions of the world remain below expected levels. This article looks at the effects of participation in organic markets and farmers' organizations on the adoption of soil conservation practices. Based on original survey data from 241 small-scale farm households in Honduras, we find that both participation in organic markets and farmer-based groups have positive effects on the number of soil conservation practices adopted. The results indicate that besides supply-oriented policy measures, such as the provision of technical assistance and extension, demand-related factors are likely to play an important role in sustainable soil management. Demand-oriented policy measures include support for labeling initiatives and consumer education to facilitate value-added product differentiation and market segmentation. © 2010 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

AB  - A bivariate probit model was employed to jointly and separately estimate banana market participation decisions of buying and selling households in Rwanda and Burundi using household survey data. Selectivity bias was corrected for estimating the transacted volumes using Heckman's procedure. The results showed that transaction cost-related factors such as geographical location of households, market information sources, and travel time to the nearest urban center influence market participation. Non-price-related factors such as security of land tenure, labor availability, off-farm income, gender of the household head, and years of farming experience had a significant influence on the transacted volumes. Output prices had a significant correlation with sales volume, indicating price incentives increased supply by sellers. Generally, the findings suggest that policies aimed at investments in rural road infrastructure, market information systems, collective marketing, and value addition of banana products may provide a potential avenue for mitigating transaction costs and enhancing market participation and production of marketed surplus by rural households. © 2010 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

AB  - Zoonoses are infections naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans. An exploratory questionnaire-based survey of animal health workers(n=36) and livestock keepers(n=43) was carried out from April 2001 to March 2002 in Tanga and Arusha regions, northern Tanzania, to assess local knowledge, attitudes and public awareness for animal zoonoses. A combination of closed and open-ended questions, focus group discussions and ranking techniques were employed to gather information on perceptions concerning the type of zoonotic diseases prevalent in the study area, level of risk, mode of transmission and methods of preventing disease transmission from animals to humans. The results demonstrated that rabies, tuberculosis and anthrax were considered the three most common zoonotic diseases. Sharing living accommodation with animals, consumption of un-treated livestock products (i.e. milk, meat or eggs) and attending to parturition were perceived as routes of transmission. Knowledge about zoonosis was higher in smallholder dairy (92%; 33/36) than traditional livestock keepers (P<0.05). On the contrary, the perceived risk of contracting a zoonosis was significantly higher in traditional livestock (86%; 6/7) than smallholder dairy keepers (P<0.05). Stratification of the risk of zoonosis by farm location revealed that rural farms (85%; 7/8) were considered significantly at a higher risk when compared to peri or urban located farms (P<0.05). Most of the respondents stated cooking of meat or boiling of milk as a way to prevent transmission. However, there was a significant difference in the perception of the risk posed by contact with potentially infected animals /or animal products with animal health workers having a much higher level of perception compared to livestock keepers. These results suggest that in the Tanga and Arusha, Tanzania, patchy awareness and knowledge of zoonoses, combined with food consumption habits and poor animal husbandry are likely to expose respondents to an increased risk of contracting zoonoses. Public health promotion on education and inter-disciplinary one-health collaboration between vets, public health practitioners and policy makers should result in a more efficient and effective joint approach to the diagnosis and control of zoonoses in Tanzania.

AB  - The seeds of Allanblackia trees produce edible oil with significant global market potential. Consequently, a private-public partnership involving Unilever and known as ‘Novella Africa’ is engaged in the development of Allanblackia as a new crop in a number of African countries. The purpose of this partnership is to build a profitable and sustainable initiative for harvest, marketing and cultivation. Rural communities are directly involved and a participatory approach to domestication is being followed to maximise farmers' livelihood benefits. This is the first time a multinational company has partnered in such an approach, and the initiative represents an example for the domestication of other new tree crops. Investing in good communication between partners is considered to be essential to success by ensuring trust and a common understanding of priorities. Progress to date has involved the establishment of market supply chains for oil, based firstly on wild harvest, and the initiation of cultivation by smallholders. Further work will involve the development of rural resource centres to deliver improved germplasm to growers. At the same time, these centres will provide other services such as market information, credit and access to buyers. Through this strategy it is foreseen that there will be progress towards the development of a market value chain which removes producers' constraints to profitable involvement. Furthermore, the diversification of farmers' cropping systems should have positive impacts for biodiversity and provide resilience in the face of climate change. Currently, the most important activity under the initiative is the promotion of Allanblackia planting, so that production constraints do not hamper market development. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The misuse of personal protective equipment (PPE) during pesticide application was investigated among smallholders in Colombia. The integrative agent-centered (IAC) framework and a logistic regression approach were adopted. The results suggest that the descriptive social norm was significantly influencing PPE use. The following were also important: (1) having experienced pesticide-related health problems; (2) age; (3) the share of pesticide application carried out; and (4) the perception of PPE hindering work. Interestingly, the influence of these factors differed for different pieces of PPE. Since conformity to the social norm is a source of rigidity in the system, behavioral change may take the form of a discontinuous transition. In conclusion, five suggestions for triggering a transition towards more sustainable PPE use are formulated: (1) diversifying targets/tools; (2) addressing structural aspects; (3) sustaining interventions in the long-term; (4) targeting farmers' learning-by-experience; and (5) targeting PPE use on a collective level.

AB  - Agricultural education, research, and extension can contribute substantially to reducing rural poverty in the developing world. However, evidence suggests that their contributions are falling short in Sub-Saharan Africa. The entry of new actors, technologies, and market forces, when combined with new economic and demographic pressures, suggests the need for more innovative and less linear approaches to promoting a technological transformation of smallholder agriculture. This paper explores methodologies that can help improve the study of agricultural innovation processes and their role in transforming agriculture. We examine methods that address three key issues: (a) how agents interact in the production, exchange, and use of knowledge and information; (b) how agents respond individually and collectively to technological, institutional, or organizational opportunities and constraints; and (c) how policy changes can enhance the welfare effects of these interactions and responses. Methods include social network analysis, innovation histories, cross-country comparisons, and game-theory modeling. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article introduces this special issue on the rapid transformation of the agrifood industry in developing countries and its effects on small farmers. We review the literature from the late 1980s to the present and find evidence first of food processing then retail transformation, and mixed evidence of impacts on small farmers, both inclusion (particularly with "resource-providing contracts") and exclusion (sometimes from scale-constraint, sometimes from inadequate non-land assets). The special issue papers contribute to the debate by confirming the mix of cases of inclusion and exclusion. The cases are main in horticulture and dairy, key hopes for smallholder development. © 2009.

AB  - A method (SPID) based on sequential plan for individual decision with a pegboard was tested over the 2006 and 2007 cropping seasons in 15 cotton producing villages in Cameroon - covering almost 700 farmers and 2000 ha to help farmers decide on when to spray their cotton crops against bollworms. This method was promoted through training sessions, from researchers to farmers through the technical staff of the cotton company (SODECOTON). This innovation led to a significant reduction in the number of sprays in 5 village-years out of 17 (total number of villages for 2006 and 2007). The number of sprays was larger than in the calendar-based programme in nine village-years, mainly due to poorly controlled infestations of Diparopsis watersi (Rothschild). However, this larger number of sprays led to a greater (seven village-years) or equal (two village-years) seed-cotton yield than that obtained with the calendar-based programme. When the number of sprays was equal or smaller, seed-cotton yield was greater (two village-years) or equal (six village-years) to LPD. Lastly, income increased proportionally to seed-cotton yield. An analysis of decisions made by farmers using the pegboard, as well as an a posteriori evaluation test, showed that users successfully learned the method and were confident in its diagnosis. This new method is not hampered by the constraints experienced with the former LEC ('targeted staggered control') spraying decision method - sequential sampling reduces the number of plants to be monitored, spraying decisions are made for individual plots, income rises and the role of supervisors is reduced. However, large-scale dissemination of this innovation is being hampered by the collective management of cotton production and the need to train a large number of farmers. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Concerns about rising food prices, food security and land grabs have focussed attention on land redistribution and land reform in recent years. The majority of the rural people and rural poor are women, but the issue of gender within land reform is rarely discussed. Agrarian reforms redistribute land either to collectives or to individual households; this article surveys the impact of the latter model of land reform for women, based on case studies from Asia, Africa and Latin America. A mixed picture emerges, but women have been seriously disadvantaged within most programmes by the granting of land title or permits to men as household heads. Husbands have often gained power at their wives' expense. The potential benefits of landholding for women are substantial, however, and calls for women's land rights are increasing. A question concerns what form these should take: customary law often discriminates against women, but individual land titling is likely to result in loss of land, especially among the poor. Redistributionist land reforms that have state backing are more likely to be concerned with equity. In order for such programmes to fulfil their democratic potential, smallholder women must gain rights on the same basis as men, and these must be enforced 'on the ground'. © 2009 The Author Journal Compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Different types of cooperative agreements between smallholders continue to play an important role in rural areas in developing countries. While some empirical studies examine the conditions catalysing the successful formation of cooperatives, quantifications of the net benefits, i.e., difference between revenues and costs, of cooperation and how farmers divide these net benefits are scarce. Therefore, we develop a quantitative framework to analyse and allocate net benefits in a cooperative production agreement. The framework allows for cooperative exchange of several types of resources and the production of multiple products. Linear programming provides insight into optimal production levels, both for individual and cooperating farmers, and gives optimal revenue levels. A transaction cost function is used to account for costs of cooperation, such as meeting costs, moral hazard and free ridership of labour use and the risks of farmers defaulting from the agreement. Transaction costs are likely to increase with the number of households participating, the total cropping area and the heterogeneity of resources of the cooperating farmers. Therefore, we introduce a measure of heterogeneity in the resources for each cooperative. Finally, cooperative game theory is used to generate fair divisions of the net benefits in a cooperative. This framework may be used to give additional explanations to the findings in empirical studies on cooperatives. We illustrate this with an empirical example from northern Nigeria. It is found that cooperation between farmers sharing complementary resources gives the highest revenues. Next, we illustrate the effects of two different transaction cost functions. For reasonable assumptions on these functions, cooperation remains economically attractive. Nevertheless, larger and more diverse coalitions are not always the most beneficial, while the returns in some small coalitions are negative, possibly impeding the formation of cooperatives in some locations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To measure the impact of China's New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS)on catastrophic medical payments of rural households in Linyi County, Shandong Province. Method: In 2005, from a stratified cluster sample of 3101 rural households, we identified 375 households that might be at risk of catastrophic payments by searching through NCMS claims and interviewing key informants. We interviewed these 375 households and confirmed that 231 had had catastrophic payments (≥ 40% of the households' capacity to pay; CTP) during 2004. A validity test of our screening method found another eight cases among immediate neighbours of these 375 households; by extrapolation, we obtained an adjusted total of 289 catastrophic households in the sample of 3101. We measured the impact of the NCMS on hardship alleviation by counterfactual analysis, comparing catastrophic payments before and after NCMS reimbursements. Result: The effect was twofold. Before NCMS intervention 8.98% of Linyi population had had catastrophic out-of-pocket payments compared with 8.25% after reimbursements. Catastrophic severity for households remaining in catastrophe after reimbursement dropped by 18.7% to an average of 6.34 times the household's CTP. Conclusion: Out-of-pocket medical payments remain a burden for rural households. Financial protection from the NCMS, with an average reimbursement of 17.8%, was modest and should be restructured to provide better benefits that are targeted to those in most need.

AB  - EurepGAP is a pioneering field level food safety protocol called 'good agricultural practices' currently exercising influence over the global food quality assurance system. Developed by a consortium of major European retailers, this private standard enforces codes of conduct that address issues of health and safety for producers and consumers, as well as working conditions and environmental management on the farmland. Despite various merits and benefits that the standard is premised to offer, the institutional design gives a financial edge to powerful large farms and exporters while diminishing opportunities for smaller growers and exporters to remain in the profitable agricultural export sector of the Global South. This paper explores the institutional origin and evolution of EurepGAP, discusses entry barriers and risks that EurepGAP imposes on the global value chain stakeholders, as well as the ethical implications from broader theoretical perspectives. Subsequently, it examines the evolving nature of a new trend in the fresh fruit and vegetable sector, i.e., the rise of public GAP standards. Promoted by some governments in the Global South, these GAP standards emphasize support for horizontal partnerships among value chain stakeholders, farmer participation, and less capital-intensive agricultural innovations. The paper argues that, within certain limitations, these GAP standards have the potential to be the major alternative GAP approach by encouraging a much broader inclusion of small-scale producers towards the attainment of various social, economic, and environmental benefits. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Alternative trade organizations (ATOs) based on philosophies of social justice and/or encironmental well-being are establishing new channels of trade and marketing. Partisans promote ATOs as systems to transfer benefits from consumers in the wealthy northern hemisphere to producers in the poor southern hemisphere. The central public policy question is whether the well-being of poor agricultural producers in the sourthern hemisphere is actually being improved by fair-trade practices, or are consumers who buy products on this premise deceived? The research reported here partially answers the question whether participation in a fair-trade coffee marketing channel delivers benefits to small-scale producers in Latin America. The authors employ a survey methodology to compare TransFair USA (TF) cooperative participants and nonparticipating farmers in three countries on socioeconomic indicators of well-being. According to the analysis, the economic effects of fair-trade participation are unassailable; the effectrs on educational and health outcomes are uneve. Howeverf, TF cooperative participation positively affects educational attainment and the likelihood that a child is currently studying. The authors find positive health-related consequences of TF cooperative participation.

AB  - The cotton, textile, and apparel industries - which are critical sectors of the Pakistan economy and important determinants of rural and urban poverty - face challenges that include instability in the world prices of cotton, liberalization of multilateral trade of textiles and clothing since 2004, and strengthening of the currency arising from a surge in foreign capital inflows and remittances since 2001. Using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model calibrated to a 2001-02 social accounting matrix of the Pakistan economy and linked to the 2001-02 Pakistan Household Integrated Economic Survey, this report conducts simulation experiments and analyzes the intersectoral and poverty implications of (1) an increase in foreign savings inflows into Pakistan; (2) an increase in world prices of cotton lint and yarn, textiles, or a combination of these; (3) a government production subsidy to one of the cotton-related sectors; and (4) an improvement in total factor productivity (TFP) in one or more of these sectors. Simulation 1 analyzes the effects on competitiveness, particularly for the cotton and textile industries, through an appreciation of the real exchange rate that results from the surge in foreign capital inflows. The results indicate that increased capital inflows raise real investment and household income and reduce poverty in Pakistan, but the tradable sectors (particularly the cotton and textile sectors) contract, and the incomes of farmers decline. Under conditions of capital outflow, as started to occur in 2008 owing to political turmoil in Pakistan and rising world food and oil prices, our simulations would imply effects the reverse of those modeled herein. Simulation 2 analyzes the effects of an increase in world cotton and textile prices. Historical indicators show wide cotton lint price fluctuations; cotton fabric prices move to reflect the raw material price as well as for other reasons. Production and exports in Pakistan improve under positive sectoral price shocks, with greater benefits to farmers (particularly cotton households) and rural areas from an increase in cotton prices. There are indirect adverse intersectoral effects between the cotton and textile sectors, as a boom in either sector causes the exchange rate to appreciate. The textile industry is backed by a strong and powerful association that lobbies for government support and subsidies. Simulation 3 analyzes the effects of a government subsidy to the industry. The financing of the subsidy in the analysis is either through a compensatory consumption tax or through a compensatory income tax. The subsidy leads to an overall decrease in welfare in both cases. It will increase poverty if the financing is through an additional consumption tax because of the upward taxation effect on consumer prices. However, it will reduce poverty if the financing is through an income tax, in which case the burden of additional taxation falls only on urban non-poor households, creating an indirect transfer from the urban non-poor to other household groups. Liberalization of the world trade in textiles and clothing resulting from ending the quota-based Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2004 has affected world prices and trade patterns of cotton lint and yarn, textiles, and apparel. This will test Pakistan's ability to compete in world markets. Pakistan can best take advantage of this shift if it improves its competitiveness through higher productivity. Simulation 4 examines cases of higher industry TFP in raw cotton, cotton lint and yarn, and textiles in both the short and long run using a dynamic-recursive version of the CGE model. The increase in TFP is welfare-increasing, with dynamic effects and the level of impact among the cotton-textile sectors and across household groups depending on whether productivity improves in one or more of these highly interdependent sectors. Overall the results of simulations 1 and 2 demonstrate different effects arising from two largely external positive shocks: the increase in foreign savings strengthens the currency and creates a boom in the nontrade sectors, whereas an increase in world cotton or textile prices improves Pakistan's terms of trade and generates a boom in these sectors in particular. An inflow of foreign savings depresses traded sectors but stimulates investment and expanded production of nontraded goods. Because of the large share of the cotton-related sectors in overall exports, an export boom in these sectors also strengthens the currency, which negatively affects other tradables and the domestic currency value of household income from any given level of foreign remittances. These different effects must be understood by policymakers trying to assess, for example, the performance of the cotton, yarn, and textile sectors and their impacts on employment and poverty. These impacts must be evaluated in light of more liberalized trade rules, the capital inflow or increase in foreign remittances that occurred during 2000-06, the decline in world cotton prices in the 1990s, and the reversal of these circumstances that has recently been evident. Simulations 3 and 4 are relevant to policymakers who must direct limited domestic resources to capacity-building public investments but who also face calls for more direct support from industry lobbies.

AB  - The pursuit of so-called "green jobs" - employment that contributes to protecting the environment and reducing humanity's carbon foot-print - will be a key economic driver of the 21st century. "Climate-proofing" the global economy will involve large-scale investments in new technologies, equipment, buildings, and infrastructure, which will provide a major stimulus for much-needed new employment and an opportunity for retaining and transforming existing jobs. The number of green jobs is on the rise. The renewable energy sector has seen rapid expansion in recent years, with current employment in renewables and supplier industries estimated at a conservative 2.3 million worldwide. The wind power industry employs some 300,000 people, the solar photovoltaics (PV) sector an estimated 170,000, and the solar thermal industry more than 600,000. More than I million jobs are found in the biofuels industry growing and processing a variety of feedstocks into ethanol and biodiesel. Construction jobs can be greened by ensuring that new buildings meet high performance standards. And retrofitting existing buildings to make them more energy-efficient has huge job potential for construction workers, architects, energy auditors, engineers, and others. The weatherization of some 200,000 apartments in Germany created 25,000 new jobs and helped retain 116,000 existing jobs in 2002-04. The transportation industry is a cornerstone of modern economics, but it also has the fastest-rising carbon emissions of any sector. Relatively green auto manufacturing jobs - those in manufacturing the most-efficient cars currently available - today number no more than about 250,000 out of roughly 8 million in the auto sector worldwide. Modern rail and urban transit systems offer a greener alternative, but they need fresh commitment and investments to reverse the job erosion of recent decades. In growing numbers of cities, good jobs are being generated by the emergence of bus rapid transit systems. There are also substantial green employment opportunities in retrofitting old diesel buses to reduce air pollutants and in replacing old equipment with cleaner compressed natural gas (CNG) or hybrid-electric buses. In New Delhi, the introduction of 6,100 CNG buses by 2009 is expected to create 18,000 new jobs. The steel, aluminum, cement, and paper industries are highly energy-intensive and polluting. But increasing scrap use, greater energy efficiency, and reliance on alternative energy sources may at least render them a pale shade of green. Worldwide, more than 40 percent of steel output and one-quarter of aluminum production is based on recycled scrap, possibly employing more than a quarter million people. Recycling and remanufacturing jobs worldwide number many millions, but incompatible definitions and a lack of data gathering make a global tally impossible. China alone is thought to have some 10 million jobs in this sector, and the United States has more than 1 million. In developing countries, recycling is often done by informal networks of scavengers. Brazil, which boasts a high rate of aluminum recycling, relies on some 500,000 scrap collectors. Cairo's 70,000 Zabaleen recycle as much as 85 percent of the materials they collect. Agriculture and forestry often still account for the bulk of employment and livelihoods in many developing countries. Small farms are more labor- and knowledge-intensive than agroindustrial farms are, and they use fewer energy and chemical inputs. But relatively sustainable forms of smallholder agriculture are being squeezed hard by energy- and pesticide-intensive farms and by global supply chains. Organic farming is still limited. But because it is more labor-intensive than industrialized agriculture, it can be a source of growing green employment. Afforestation and reforestation efforts, as well as better stewardship of critical ecosystems more generally, could support livelihoods among the more than 1 billion people who depend on forests, often through non-timber forest products. Planting trees creates large numbers of jobs, although these are often seasonal and low paid. Agroforestry, which combines tree planting with traditional farming, offers significant environmental benefits in degraded areas - including carbon sequestration. Some 1.2 billion people already depend on it to some extent. There is additional job potential in efforts to adapt to, and cope with, climate change. Building flood barriers, terracing land, and rehabilitating wetlands is labor-intensive work. Efforts to protect croplands from environmental degradation and to adapt farming to climate change by raising water efficiency, preventing erosion, planting trees, using conservation tillage, and rehabilitating degraded crop and pastureland can also support rural livelihoods. The potential for green jobs is immense. But much of it will not materialize without massive and sustained investments in the public and private sectors. Governments need to establish a firm framework for greening all aspects of the economy, with the help of targets and mandates, business incentives, and reformed tax and subsidy policies. It will also be critical to develop innovative forms of technology transfer to spread green methods around the world at the scale and speed required to avoid full-fledged climate change. Cooperative technology development and technology-sharing programs could help expedite the process of replicating best practices. To provide as many workers as possible with the qualifications they will increasingly need, an expansion of green education, training, and skill-building programs in a broad range of occupations is crucial. Resource extraction and energy-intensive industries are likely to feel the greatest impact in transitioning to a low-carbon future, and regions and communities highly dependent on them will need assistance in diversifying their economic base, creating alternative jobs and livelihoods, and acquiring new skills. This is known as a "just transition." Green jobs need to be decent jobs - offering good wages and income security, safe working conditions, dignity at work, and adequate workers' rights. Sadly, this is not always the case today. Recycling work is sometimes precarious, involving serious occupational health hazards and often generating less than living wages and incomes. Growing crops at biofuels plantations in countries like Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia, and Indonesia often involves excessive workloads, poor pay, exposure to pesticides, and oppression of workers. These cautionary aspects highlight the need for sustainable employment to be good not only for the environment but also for the people holding the jobs. Still, an economy that reconciles human aspirations with the planet's limits is eminently possible.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify important elements of a strategy to facilitate small farmer participation in international supply chains for fresh produce. Design/methodology/approach - The study employs survey data collected from a national sample of US fresh produce importers. Their concerns and suggestions regarding potential for transactions with small Mexican farmers were assessed, with factor analysis providing a thematic summary of their perspectives. Findings - Results of the study reveal that US importers are not uniformly pessimistic about the ability of small farmers to meet their demands. On the contrary, almost one-third said they probably would work with small farmers in the near future. In general, importers are interested in transactions in which the product meets consumer and government expectations and is grown on the buyer's terms, the grower is reliable over time, the transaction is simplified, and the grower handles transportation. Importers rate small farmers poorly on their ability to achieve the last two factors, but these are also the items rated least important to the importers. New approaches to building market capacity in small farmers are also highly valued by the importers, including government investment guarantees, and arrangements for facilitating contact between importers and growers. More traditional methods, such as cooperatives and use of brokers, were not rated as highly. Research limitations/implications - The study relies on cross-sectional, self-report data from one side of the grower/importer dyad. Incorporating longitudinal data with a dyadic perspective could provide additional insight. Originality/value - A practitioner perspective on the challenges in international fruit and vegetable supply chains, particularly as relates to developing countries, is of considerable value. Not only can governments choose improved policies for improving market readiness for the growers, but also members of supply chains themselves can identify tactics for ensuring successful transactions by enhancing coordination. The prospects for a win-win outcome for growers and importers are improved. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Land rental market development and off-farm employment have important implications for agricultural production. This study examined the effects of land rental market participation, the resulting land tenure contracts, and off-farm employ~nent on the technical efficiency in rice production in rural China, using the one-step stochastic frontier approach. Data from a survey held at household and plot level in three villages in north-east Jiangxi Province were used to estimate the stochastic frontier model. We found that the mean technical efficiency of rice production in north-east Jiangxi Province ranged from 0.36 to 0.97, with an average of 0.82. The determinants of technical efficiency show that households that rented land achieved higher technical efficiency than households that did not rent land. Rice production on rented plots was technically as efficient as on contracted plots. Additionally, participation in migration did not have an effect on technical efficiency.

AB  - The footwear sector in Ethiopia is dominated by cheap imports from Asia, particularly from China. This has inflicted heavy impacts on the sector, and threatened its competitiveness in the domestic market. This study examines the impact of imports and coping strategies of firms to withstand the competition. Firm level data were gathered from micro, small and medium footwear enterprises. The findings revealed that Chinese shoes are superior in design, price and quality, with the result that they have taken over the domestic market. The impact of Chinese imports on local producers varied from downsizing, bankruptcy, loss of assets and property, to downgrading activities and informalising operations. Firms have pursued coping strategies that focused on improving design and quality, as well as lowering prices and profit margins. Coping strategies appear to be differentiated by size of firms, and have some association with the performance of firms. The ways forward for local producers should focus on collaborative engagements of stakeholders and government to overcome the competitive disadvantages of firms. Training, technology, quality control, benchmarking and reorganization of production should be designed as a package of intervention. In addition, strengthening local producers to engage in collective actions and promoting exports should also be given proper attention. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Rapid economic and income growth, urbanization, and globalization are leading to a dramatic shift of Asian diets away from staples and increasingly towards livestock and dairy products, vegetables and fruit, and fats and oils. While the diversification of diets away from the traditional dominance of rice with rising incomes is expected and observed, current food consumption patterns are showing signs of convergence towards a Western diet. The diet transition is characterized by increased consumption of: wheat; temperate fruit and vegetables and high protein and energy dense food. Globalization and the consequent global interconnectedness of the urban middle class, is the driving force behind the convergence of diets. The rapid spread of global supermarket chains and fast food restaurants is reinforcing the above trends. The growing demand for diet diversity cannot be met solely by the traditional food supply chain. It requires the modernisation of the food retail sector, and the vertical integration of the food supply chain, in effect linking the consumers' plate to the farmers' plow. As a consequence, Asian agriculture is on an irreversible path leading away from its traditional pre-occupation with cereal crop production, especially rice, towards a production system that is becoming increasingly commercialized and diversified. This paper describes the determinants and trends in the diversification and Westernization of Asian diets. Implications of the evolving demand trends for food supply and retail systems are presented. The paper discusses the prospects for small farmer participation in the emerging food supply system, with a particular emphasis on Asian rice production systems. Finally, the paper considers emerging challenges for food policy, small holder welfare, and agricultural research and development priorities. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper explores the impact of agricultural price policy on poverty in West Africa, a region in which prices are an important tool for raising rural household incomes. A game-theoretic, collective model of household income generation and resource allocation is developed that incorporates three features typical of West African rural households: preference heterogeneity among women and men, individual resource control, and power-mediated bargaining over resource control in the face of changes in households' economic environments. To explore price effects, the model is used to simulate the income impacts of large increases in cotton prices accompanying fast-paced agricultural liberalisation in Burkina Faso in the 1980s. The paper shows that where resources are controlled individually by household members, rather than pooled, Pareto efficiency in income generation does not hold. The impact of agricultural price policy on poverty is mediated by bargaining over resource control within households. Both the relative bargaining power of women and men and the degree of preference heterogeneity between them play fundamental roles in the outcome of such bargaining. The results point to a lower ability of households to take advantage of price incentives and thereby raise their incomes than a unitary household model, in which preferences do not differ and resources are pooled, predicts. They suggest that the effectiveness of price policy in reducing poverty in the region would be enhanced by taking into account the incentive structure within households as well as individual household members' ability to bargain over the benefit and cost streams flowing from price changes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare productivity, profitability, producer-defined constraints, and goals and research priorities between ten individually paired organic and conventional fig farms in Turkey. Ten farm pairs, each of which consists of one organic and one conventional farm with less than 10 ha of fig plantation, were selected from five Fig Sales Cooperative (Taris-Incirbirlik) regions of Aydin Province with varying agro-ecological conditions. Although six of the organic farms matched or exceeded the production of their conventional counterparts, the three-year mean yield of the organic farms as a group was 5% lower than that of the conventional farms. However, excluding organic certification costs, mean variable costs and net income were similar for both groups, mainly because organic price premiums received by the farmers compensated for lower yields. If current organic certification costs paid by firms are included to farm budgets, the price premiums paid to organic producers would have to increase to 22% in order to equal the net incomes from conventional dried fig. Conventional farmers identified low and unstable prices as the main constraints for sustained production and stated further intensification of production as their main goal. Organic farmers focused on farm diversification and agronomic practices that permit organic farm management. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Small farms are an integral part of Asian agriculture. They are characterized by the preponderance and emphasis on mixed crop-animals systems across a variety of agroecological zones. Mixed farming is the backbone of agriculture, many categories of which are models of diversification, efficiency and resilience in Asia. In global terms, small farms in Asia account for an estimated 87% of all farms of under two hectares of land. About 52% of these farms have <1 ha, with the smallest sizes (0.3-0.6 ha) being found in China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. There are three types of small farms: in irrigated areas, rainfed zones and plantation agriculture. The first category greatly benefited from policy support and massive resource inputs through the 'green revolution', while the second was bypassed by it, but continues to produce the bulk of the ruminant meats and milk. The third type remains neglected. The rural poor are mainly small farmers and landless agricultural labourers; their characteristics are described in detail. Irrespective of their various definitions, the key descriptors are deprivation, subsistence, illiteracy, survival, and because of globalization, vulnerability. Data from various sources indicate some key features concerning Asian agriculture: about 83% of the agricultural area is rainfed; between 51% and 55% of the total population of cattle and goats is found here; and about 59-60% of poor livestock keepers are found on mixed farms. The development of small farms in rainfed environments is a priority for the future and affirmative action is imperative. The strategies for development include the promotion of animal production as the entry point for food production and total factor productivity; integrated use of natural resources; improved feeding and nutrition; interdisciplinary, participatory and holistic approaches to address system constraints; and strengthening access to information and delivery systems. Effective policies are urgently required to spur this initiative; these should include development policy for small farm systems; intensifying the role of animals in integrated systems; improved rural-urban marketing linkages, infrastructure and communications. The development pathways include needs-based intensification of animal production systems; improving diversification with the appropriate mix of animals that can be integrated with annual and perennial crops; ensuring access to improved technologies and markets; strengthening empowerment; promotion of cooperatives and agri-business; and sustained pro-poor initiatives to reduce poverty and hunger that are consistent with income growth, socioeconomic benefits, improved livelihoods and self-reliance.

AB  - China is not only the leading cotton producer worldwide but has become a structural importer. The wide-scale adoption of genetically modified cotton (GMC) has led some observers to assume that Chinese production will increase substantially, thereby limiting its demand from structural cotton-exporting countries. During negotiations for the WTO Doha Round, fear of China's power in the cotton sector has been transformed into criticism of what is called its unfair subsidy policy. Both of these views are debatable and suffer from a lack of insight about the development of cotton production in China. This paper attempts to document the debate and to fill that gap. Cotton production in China is located is three main regions, along the Yellow River Valley, the Yangtze River Valley and in the Xinjiang Uigur Autonomous Region, where cotton production only began in the 1970s. This production cannot be considered separately from Chinese agriculture in general, which is currently undergoing great changes. Despite high yields, agricultural activities no longer ensure sufficient income to farmers. Off-farm activities keep the revenue of rural households from falling further behind that of urban households, but agriculture does not appear to attract the workers of rural areas, and this depopulation raises questions about the fate of farming in the years to come. Its shift towards provinces located further from the economically dynamic coastal areas depends upon the implementation of recent policies intended to correct the income disparities from which rural areas suffer. Cotton is still produced according to the high input/high output approach associated with policies to protect farmers against climatic hazards and economic risks, through input subsidies and purchase price guarantee. Although China stopped providing direct subsidies to cotton growers when it joined the WTO, intensification of production continues, and the use of GMC can be regarded as a further stage of this intensification process. This relation between past policy and GMC use must be considered before extrapolating Chinese achievements with the latter to other developing countries. The lack of collective action by farmers impedes the success of the intensification process, makes cotton farming less profitable, and may endanger the sustainable use of GMC by causing undesirable shifts of the cotton pest complex. It is doubtful that China can reverse its importing position in the cotton world market in the short run. While this may reassure cotton-exporting countries, it must not prevent them from taking measures to increase their competitiveness through improved productivity.

AB  - This article examines the effects of small farmers' competitive strategies on production relations in the non-traditional agro-export sector of the developing world. It uses a comparative case study approach involving cases with different commodity, institutional, and socio-historical features: one involving snow pea production in Kenya, the other involving chayote production in Costa Rica. Despite the contrasting characteristics of each case, small farmers in both areas responded to production and marketing risks by utilizing alternative markets. These strategies, however, decreased their ability to guarantee supply and quality to agro-export firms, which compelled such firms to develop alternative production arrangements that side-stepped small farmers. The findings reveal the limitations of non-traditional agro-export production as a rural development strategy. They also call into question the value of certain strategies as risk-reduction mechanisms for small farmers. Copyright © 2005 by the Society for Applied Anthropology.

AB  - Soil degradation is a mounting problem on many smallholder lands in developing countries. Economic analysis has been an important tool in addressing this problem, beginning with assessments of the financial attractiveness of investing in soil conservation works. Data compiled from 67 studies of the financial attractiveness of conservation technologies suggest that many can provide positive net returns at the farm level (64.2 percent). While such studies have made a valuable contribution, economists have been exploring additional applications of economics to the problem, such as the development of new perspectives under the guise of ecological economics. As a result, this paper argues it is an opportune time to assess progress in the field of economic analysis of soil degradation and to consider the policy ramifications of this research. Key issues are grouped into farm-level considerations, national policy linkages and global issues. A number of policy implications emerge. Clearly, devising effective incentives at the farm or community (collective action) level must be a priority. As part of this effort, even more attention should be paid to the influence of macroeconomic and sectoral policies on soil productivity. Since soil degradation is also a problem with global ramifications, there is a clear rationale for intervention at the international level via mechanisms such as international transfers.

AB  - This paper presents the prototype of a predictive model capable of describing both magnitudes of deforestation and its spatial articulation into patterns of forest fragmentation. In a departure from other landscape models, it establishes an explicit behavioral foundation for algorithm development, predicated on notions of the peasant economy and on household production theory. It takes a "bottom-up" approach, generating the process of land-cover change occurring at lot level together with the geography of a transportation system to describe regional landscape change. In other words, it translates the decentralized decisions of individual households into a collective, spatial impact. In so doing, the model unites the richness of survey research on farm households with the analytical rigor of spatial analysis enabled by geographic information systems (GIS). The paper describes earlier efforts at spatial modeling, provides a critique of the so-called spatially explicit model, and elaborates a behavioral foundation by considering farm practices of colonists in the Amazon basin. It then uses insight from the behavioral statement to motivate a GIS-based model architecture. The model is implemented for a long-standing colonization frontier in the eastern sector of the basin, along the Trans-Amazon Highway in the State of Pará, Brazil. Results are subjected to both sensitivity analysis and error assessment, and suggestions are made about how the model could be improved.
