TI  - Effect of forestland tenure security on rural household forest management and protection in southern China
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Initiated in 2003, China's recent round of collective forest tenure reform (CFTR) aims to improve tenure security and motivate households to engage in forestry production. For the forested land allocated to households after the reforms, forest management and protection have become key in forestry production. However, few studies have analyzed the effect of different dimensions of forestland tenure security on rural household forest management and protection. Based on survey data from 766 households in southern China, the present study examines this effect using the Negative Binomial and Tobit models. The empirical results indicate that the actual tenure security derived from the possession of forestland certificates has insignificantly increased forest management frequency and management intensity. With regard to perceived tenure security, we found that if forestland is perceived to be adjusted in the future, this can have a significant positive impact on both management frequency and management intensity. In contrast, a perception that certificates may protect forestland rights would have insignificant effect on management frequency and management intensity of forestland. Specifically, for households with certificates for all forestland, perception about future adjustments on tenure security would positively affect management frequency and intensity. For households with certificates for part of forestland, the perception about certificates has a positive impact on management frequency. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Formation of a State Support Program for Agricultural Producers in Ukraine Considering World Experience
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - In our paper we researched the state regulation in agriculture of Ukraine, as well as world experience in this field. The distribution of state financing for support of agricultural production is analyzed. We singled out the direction of state support to the agrarian sector of Ukraine. The directions of organizational reforming of households in the market conditions are investigated. The variants of integration of households of the population into more consolidated economic forms are offered. The priority of the development of cooperatives in agriculture has been argued. The positive experience of state support of servicing cooperation is considered on the example of "The Benefits of the Development of Personal Peasant, Farmers, Cooperative Movement in the Village and Advice Service for 2016-2020" of the Vinnytsia Region. The prospects of creation of cooperatives for the provision of oilseeds processing services for the energy needs of agribusinesses and provision of livestock feed with forages are argued. The prospects for realization of the program of development of agricultural servicing cooperatives within the boundaries of Ukraine are outlined.

TI  - Estimating effects of cooperative membership on farmers' safe production behaviors: evidence from the rice sector in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - The current agricultural system in China highly depends on chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Consequently, agricultural production activities cause various environmental issues. Carrying out safe production provides vital support for sustainable development of agriculture, which may improve this situation. The past decades have witnessed the fast development of rural cooperatives organization in China. Given the fact that rural cooperative organization plays a crucial role in agricultural production, however, there is little empirical evidence on the relationship between cooperative membership and safe production of smallholders in China. This study aims to investigate whether the participation in farmer cooperatives contributes to safe production in agriculture in China. Using survey data covering 623 rice-producing farm households in Sichuan province in China, this study employs the endogenous switching regression model to examine the effects of the participation in farmer cooperatives on safe production in rice agriculture. The results show that cooperative membership has significantly positive effects on safe production in rice agriculture. In particular, the average treatment effects demonstrate that without the participation in cooperatives, the members' adoption of the green control techniques would reduce by 74.491%, the application of artificial weeding would reduce by 38.768%, and organic fertilizer input would reduce by 23.448%. Furthermore, the marginal treatment effect is employed to evaluate the heterogeneous effects of the participation in farmer cooperatives on safe production in rice agriculture. Heterogeneous effect analyses suggest that farmers who are more likely to participate in farmer cooperatives are easier to adopt green control technology, while farmers who are less likely to participate in farmer cooperatives are easier to adopt artificial weeding and increase organic fertilizer input. To improve safe production in rice agriculture, the Chinese government is expected to encourage rice farmers to participate in rural cooperative organizations, and to stimulate rice farmers to take collective action to address environment issues arising from agricultural production.

TI  - Determinants of participation in Community Forestry in Nepal
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - Determinants of people's participation in community forestry activities in Tanahun district, Nepal were investigated through a survey of 304 households across ten community forest user groups, key informant interviews, and informal group discussions. Data were analysed through an ordered probit model as well as through the marginal effects of socio-economic factors on the probability of households' participation. Of the 12 variables considered in this study, only gender, caste, household size, livestock holding, network, and amount of firewood extraction proved statistically significant. In all household wealth categories, a moderate level of participation was by far the most common. Further, the results indicate that users participating more in community forestry activities have extracted higher amounts of firewood, fodder and timber although this relation was not statistically significant. Female headed and low caste households, however, participated significantly less than other household categories.

TI  - Factors affecting sustained adoption of irrigation water-saving technologies in groundwater over-exploited areas in the North China Plain
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Over-exploitation of groundwater in China has severely affected irrigation agriculture, especially in the North China Plain, and it also threatens the environment. Although water-saving technologies (WSTs) have been introduced for decades, sustained commitment to WST is not being met. This paper investigates factors affecting adoption and sustained adoption of WST based on 261 households in the North China Plain. We employ Heckman's two-stage sample selection process: (1) households decide whether to adopt WST or not and (2) households decide whether to sustainably adopt (adopt for a long time) WST or not. Particular attention is paid to the role of water scarcity in the initial adoption and sustained adoption stages. Several indicators relating to water scarcity are used to calculate a water scarcity index based on principal component analysis. The results showed that water scarcity exerts a significant and positive effect on both adoption and sustained adoption of WST. Non-adopters and non-sustained adopters face less severe water scarcity than adopters. Membership in cooperative organizations significantly improves the likelihood of sustained adoption; 63.6% of sustained adopters have a membership in cooperative organizations, compared with 18.2% of non-sustained adopters. The number of plots negatively affects the sustained adoption of WST; sustained adopters on average have 3.0 plots, and non-sustained adopters have 5.3 plots. Education, extension service, farm size, off-farm work, relatives working in the local government and irrigation costs are positively and significantly associated with adoption and sustained adoption decisions. Finally, we find that labor-saving capacity significantly influences both stages, whereas capital-saving capacity is only significant in the adoption stage. Only 10% of non-adopters consider adoption of WST as more labor- and capital-saving than conventional irrigation practices, in comparison with nearly 50% of adopters. These results imply that the extension of WST should consider focusing more on cooperative organizations and hold more demonstrations for farmers. Moreover, given that the degree of water shortage varies from region to region, the WST extension standards should vary accordingly. Governments should strengthen awareness by enhancing education and publicity concerning water scarcity and conservation.

T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This article analyzes households' choice on tea varieties in Vietnam by using a multinomial logit model. The modeling takes into account the issue of unobserved individual heterogeneity and the endogeneity of some explanatory variables (use of chemical and organic fertilizers). The results show that important factors influencing the decision to adopt one type of tea varieties include income, age, household size, farming contract, and use of organic fertilizers, but also membership of professional associations such as the Tea Association and the Farmers Union.

TI  - Vulnerability to Cumulative Hazards: Coping with the Coffee Leaf Rust Outbreak, Drought, and Food Insecurity in Nicaragua
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Recurrent food insecurity in the highlands of Central America has been exacerbated by the recent convergence of a coffee leaf rust outbreak that began defoliating crops in 2011 and a drought that started in 2014. In the context of these multiple challenges, this paper explores how seasonal hunger is related to smallholder organizational affiliation, farm and farmer characteristics, and post-hazard household-level coping strategies. The study integrates qualitative research, hydro-climatic data analysis, and a survey of 368 households completed in 2014. A number of household capacities correlate significantly with shorter periods of seasonal hunger: households with larger farms, with off-farm employment, and that produce more than half of their food, maintain more fruit trees, and harvest more coffee reported fewer lean months. We find evidence consistent with path dependence in how households cope with a sequence of environmental hazards, as the reported use of less preferred coping responses to past events (e.g., Hurricane Mitch and the 2009 drought) tended to correlate with their continued use after subsequent hazards. A comparison of coping responses of households affiliated with a farmer-to-farmer institution promoting subsistence-oriented production with those affiliated with cooperatives prioritizing sustainable coffee exports shows that farmer institutions were not strongly correlated with the number of lean months or coping mechanisms.

TI  - Livelihood analysis of livestock farmers in arid region of Deccan Plateau
T2  - RANGE MANAGEMENT AND AGROFORESTRY
AB  - Resource-poor farmers forms a major part in arid eco system of the country. Livestock in the life of these farmers' plays varied roles - as an asset, offers economic fluidity, is all-weather income source etc. Most important one is it brings in sustainability to crop cultivation in arid system. A study was taken up to analyse the role of livestock in the livelihood of farmers, emphasising more on resource poor farmers using sustainable livelihood framework. Analysis of data collected by employing standardised interview schedule to 162 households of 3 districts of arid zone of Southern India revealed asymmetrical livelihood pentagon with limited social and financial capitals. Landholding explained 65 percent variation on livestock income indicating more equitable distribution of livestock income across farmers of different landholding categories. Therefore, promotion of collective actions, technology dissemination and also incessant research on livestock husbandry for resource-poor farmers should become part of the strategic plan to reduce agrarian crisis and bring in social parity in rural areas.

TI  - Use of a predictive model for food insecurity estimates in Brazil
T2  - ARCHIVOS LATINOAMERICANOS DE NUTRICION
AB  - In 2004 the National Household Survey (Pesquisa Nacional par Amostras de Domicilios - PNAD) estimated the prevalence of food and nutrition insecurity in Brazil. However, PNAD data cannot be disaggregated at the municipal level. The objective of this study was to build a statistical model to predict severe food insecurity for Brazilian municipalities based on the PNAD dataset. Exclusion criteria were: incomplete food security data (19.30%); informants younger than 18 years old (0.07%); collective households (0.05%); households headed by indigenous persons (0.19%). The modeling was carried out in three stages, beginning with the selection of variables related to food insecurity using univariate logistic regression. The variables chosen to construct the municipal estimates were selected from those included in PNAD as well as the 2000 Census. Multivariate logistic regression was then initiated, removing the non-significant variables with odds ratios adjusted by multiple logistic regression. The Wald Test was applied to check the significance of the coefficients in the logistic equation. The final model included the variables: per capita income; years of schooling; race and gender of the household head; urban or rural residence; access to public water supply; presence of children; total number of household inhabitants and state of residence. The adequacy of the model was tested using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (p=0.561) and ROC curve (area=0.823). Tests indicated that the model has strong predictive power and can be used to determine household food insecurity in Brazilian municipalities, suggesting that similar predictive models may be useful tools in other Latin American countries.

TI  - Forestland transfer between rural households in Jiangxi, China: Differentiated effects of actual and perceived tenure security
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING
AB  - This study analyzes the potentially differentiated impacts of actual and perceived tenure security on rural households' forestland transfer behavior. Logit and Tobit models were estimated using repeated survey data from 505 households in 50 villages of Jiangxi Province during 2017-2018. The results show that there is a great difference in the influence of actual and perceived tenure security on the transfer behavior. Issuing forest tenure certificates promotes the renting out of forestland by households but has no significant effect on forestland renting in. Meanwhile, perceived tenure security has a significant effect on forestland transfer behavior. Households' understanding and evaluation of the existing tenure policy also has a significantly positive impact on household's rent-out behavior. Further, the logging quota system has a significantly negative effect on household's renting in and out behavior. Our analysis suggests that the government should strive to improve the awareness of rural families regarding forest tenure policy and that the logging quota should be modified to incentivize farmers' active participation in forest management.

TI  - To reallocate or not: Reconsidering the dilemma in China's agricultural land tenure policy
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - In China, rural land is collectively owned at the village level. Village officials usually have the power to reallocate land property across families on an ongoing basis due to demographic changes in the village. Realizing that frequent land reallocation and abusive land requisition will undermine economic productivity as well as social stability, the "Rural Land Contract Law" passed in 2002 explicitly reads that farmland tenure security must be maintained for at least 30 years since the last nationwide reallocation in 1998. The frequency and magnitude of land reallocation in Chinese villages have decreased as a result. However, failure to allocate land to the newly increased population often induced conflicts among village members if the security of land tenure for 30 years was strictly implemented. Administrative land reallocations then still continued in some villages to accommodate demographic changes in these places. Based on an almost nationally representative rural dataset collected in 119 villages of 6 provinces across China in 2008, this paper lays out some stylized facts about the administrative land reallocation after 1998. By analyzing the opinions of over 2200 farmers on the central policy of maintaining farmland tenure security, we are able to rationalize why some farmers support the policy while others oppose it. This analysis helps us to better understand the dilemma between efficiency and equity embedded in the current agricultural land system in China. It is further shown that social conflicts among village members may easily arise either due to administrative land reallocation or due to lack of it. We argue that this dilemma cannot be resolved effectively without coordinated reforms in household registration system which can help hundreds of millions of Chinese rural migrant workers to permanently settle in cities and release their farmland to those who stay in the countryside.

TI  - New cooperative medical scheme decreased financial burden but expanded the gap of income-related inequity: evidence from three provinces in rural China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB  - Background: Subsidizing healthcare costs through insurance schemes is crucial to overcome financial barriers to health care and to avoid high medical expenditures for patients in China. The health insurance could decrease financial risk by less out-of-pocket (OOP) payment, but not promise the protection equity. With the growth of New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) financing and coverage since 2008, the protection effectiveness and equity of the modified NCMS policies on financial burden should be further evaluated.
   Methods: A cross-sectional household survey was conducted in Zhejiang, Hubei, and Chongqing provinces by multi-stage stratified random sampling in 2011. A total of 1,525 households covered by the NCMS were analyzed. The protection effectiveness and protection equity of NCMS was analyzed by comparing the changes in health care utilization and medical expenditures, and the changes in the prevalence of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and its concentration indices (CIs) between pre- and post-NCMS reimbursement, respectively.
   Results: The medical financial burden was still remarkably high for the low income rural residents in China due to high OOP payment, even after NCMS reimbursement. In Hubei province, the OOP payment of the poorest quintile was almost same as their households' annual expenditures. Even it was higher than their annual expenditures in Chongqing municipality. Effective reimbursement ratio of both outpatient and inpatient services were far lower than nominal reimbursement ratio originally designed by NCMS plans. After NCMS reimbursement, the prevalence of CHE was considerably high in all three provinces, and the absolute values of CIs were even higher than those before reimbursement, indicating the inequity exaggerated.
   Conclusion: Policymakers should further modify NCMS policy in rural China. The high OOP payment could be decreased by expanding the drug list and check directory for benefit package of NCMS to minimize the gap between nominal reimbursement ratio and effective reimbursement ratio. And the increase in medical expenditures should be controlled by monitoring excess demand from both medical service providers and patients, and changing fee-for-service payment for providers to a prospective payment system. Service accessibility and affordability for vulnerable rural residents should be protected by modifying regressive financing in NCMS, and by providing extra financial aid and reimbursement from government.

TI  - Patterns of income allocation among poor Gecekondu households in Turkey: overt mechanisms and women's secret kitties
T2  - SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW
AB  - This article examines the extent to which patterns of income allocation within the household influence poverty. The study proposes a new conceptual distinction between overt and covert mechanisms. It makes use of established concepts of financial management and control to explain the overt mechanisms, but questions the significance of existing management typologies in understanding poverty. The data draws on interviews conducted separately with both spouses in low-income households carefully selected from a gecekondu settlement in Ankara. Contrary to the dominant view, the research demonstrates a general tendency for both spouses to care for the 'collective good' in their income allocation decisions; thereby minimising further deprivation of the overall household and its individual members. It is also demonstrated that how total income is distributed in practice may be of greater relevance in understanding overall household deprivation than systems of financial management and control. Finally, secret kitties are shown to operate as a covert mechanism whereby women claim enhanced financial agency and indirectly challenge men's authority without causing increased deprivation for the overall household or the children.

TI  - Estimating water demand for domestic use in rural South Africa in the absence of price information
T2  - WATER POLICY
AB  - The paper applies the travel cost method (TCM) to estimate the value that rural households in the Steelpoort subbasin of South Africa place on river and collective tap water. While the TCM calculations are based on the opportunity cost of the time household members spend on water collection, the resulting welfare values are close in magnitude to the estimates obtained using a contingent valuation method (CVM) on the same sample. The paper shows that in the absence of price data, the TCM provides satisfactory estimates of benefits where direct estimation of demand elasticity would otherwise be impossible. According to both methods, households consuming river water attribute higher value to the resource than collective tap users. The income elasticity of the trip generating function is much higher than that of the opportunity cost of time (price), implying that household's water use behaviour would be more responsive to factors affecting household income than to price incentives. Comparing the estimated values with actual operating and maintenance cost of water provision in the study area suggests that policies promoting cost-covering water tariffs have a potential to succeed.

TI  - Lineage-based heterogeneity and cooperative behavior in rural China
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper investigates how lineages, the commonly found organizations in rural villages of China, affect people's intra- and cross-lineage cooperative behavior. We use data from the Chinese Household Income Project Survey 2002, which exclusively contains information about the lineage structure in these villages allowing us to classify three levels of lineage-based heterogeneity. Our identification strategy relies on the exogeneity of lineage-based heterogeneity. We find evidence that people in a village with higher lineage-based heterogeneity are less likely to exhibit reciprocity behavior within lineages or contribute to the provision of public goods that are jointly shared across lineages. The estimation results remain robust to the inclusion of various control variables and additional background characteristics. Finally, we examine a number of other economic outcomes and find that more homogenous villages do better than other types of villages.

TI  - The social and economic context and determinants of schistosomiasis japonica
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - A variety of biological and social factors govern schistosomiasis japonica in China. Social factors include those at a national and regional level, such as policies and patterns of development, which impact on local economic activities, and affect community, household and personal risk factors of infection. Drawing on research conducted in China, we illustrate how social structural and related factors influence individual risk and prevalence of infection. At a macro-level, political changes have occurred resulting in the shift from collective to family-based production, leading to clustering of infection in families. Industrialization and urbanization, and associated increased population mobility, have also influenced patterns of transmission and infection. Types of activities and local production patterns determine the exposure of individuals to schistosome-infested water sources. Fishermen have the most frequent water contact, aquatic workers the second and farmers the third; the relative risk of Schistosoma japonicum infection follows the same order. Among farmers, human infection is significantly related to agricultural production in rice fields infested with the intermediate host snail, and to rates of the infection in livestock. Risk of S. japonicum infection is also influenced by the domestic environment, including both the location of the house in relation to snail-colonized water sources, access to safe water, and improved sanitation. Household wealth and income determine family ability to provide and maintain safe water and sanitation, while determining or interacting with other variables. At an individual level, sex, age, educational level and ethnicity are all associated with different patterns of water use and water contact behaviour thereby affecting infection rates. Schistosomiasis impairs the growth and nutrition of children and the physical work capacity of adults, and so affects economic development. Given this, we note the importance of further research and social and contextual aspects of schistosomiasis infection in order to develop and sustain sound control strategies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Factors associated with harvest and postharvest loss among soybean farmers in Western Parana State, Brazil
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - The United Nations included reducing harvest and postharvest losses as a Sustainable Millennium Development Goal in 2015, leading to increased research and policymaker interest in reducing losses to insure food security. This article analyzes the factors associated with self-reported harvest loss among soybean farmers in Parana, Brazil, using a survey of 243 farmers. The principal-agent problem is the most important contributor to harvest and postharvest losses on the farm. Loss is lowered when the combines are operated at slower speeds and are adjusted properly, but combine operators have incentives to complete harvesting jobs and deliver soybean to storage facilities quickly. Farmers report training of the combine operators as one of the most important causes of postharvest loss. Empirical results show that farmers report a 1.5 percentage points higher harvest loss when they ask a third party to harvest. Similarly, the farmers' education level is negatively associated with harvest loss; farmers with college completion have 1.6 percentage points less loss compared to farmers with less than fourth grade. However, larger planted areas are associated with higher harvest loss. The paper suggests that who harvests the crop is critical in reducing harvest loss. Policies and contract designs that align incentives between farmers and combine operators might reduce harvest and postharvest loss.

TI  - Policy improvements and farmers' willingness to participate: Insights from the new round of China's Sloping Land Conversion Program
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We use face-to-face interview survey data collected in 2017 from farmers located in Xinjiang province, China to identify influencing factors for willingness to adopt the new round of the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP). Results indicate that socio-demographic characteristics and the livelihood endowment of rural households, policy improvements, and external supports influence farmers' willingness to participate in the new round of the SLCP. We also find that it is essential to improve fanners' off-farm skills and forestry management abilities, optimize the compensation scheme of the SLCP, and strengthen the supporting capacity of forestry specialized cooperatives to enhance farmers' enthusiasm for participating in the new round of the SLCP. We discuss the implications of these findings.

TI  - A quantitative framework to analyse cooperation between rural households
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Different types of cooperative agreements between smallholders continue to play an important role in rural areas in developing countries. While some empirical studies examine the conditions catalysing the successful formation of cooperatives, quantifications of the net benefits, i.e., difference between revenues and costs, of cooperation and how farmers divide these net benefits are scarce. Therefore, we develop a quantitative framework to analyse and allocate net benefits in a cooperative production agreement. The framework allows for cooperative exchange of several types of resources and the production of multiple products.
   Linear programming provides insight into optimal production levels, both for individual and cooperating farmers, and gives optimal revenue levels. A transaction cost function is used to account for costs of cooperation, such as meeting costs, moral hazard and free ridership of labour use and the risks of farmers defaulting from the agreement. Transaction costs are likely to increase with the number of households participating, the total cropping area and the heterogeneity of resources of the cooperating farmers. Therefore, we introduce a measure of heterogeneity in the resources for each cooperative. Finally, cooperative game theory is used to generate fair divisions of the net benefits in a cooperative.
   This framework may be used to give additional explanations to the findings in empirical studies on cooperatives. We illustrate this with an empirical example from northern Nigeria. It is found that cooperation between farmers sharing complementary resources gives the highest revenues. Next, we illustrate the effects of two different transaction cost functions. For reasonable assumptions on these functions, cooperation remains economically attractive. Nevertheless, larger and more diverse coalitions are not always the most beneficial, while the returns in some small coalitions are negative, possibly impeding the formation of cooperatives in some locations.

TI  - Do migrants get stuck in the informal sector? Findings from a household survey in four Indonesian cities
T2  - BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - This article compares labour-market outcomes for individuals in migrant and non-migrant households in Indonesia. It introduces two new work-status groups - small-business operators and formal-casual or contract employees - in an effort to transcend the usual formal-informal distinction. We find that long-term migrants (LTMs) tend to gravitate to the small-business sector and to jobs with regular wages, whereas recent and very recent migrants are more likely to work in the informal sector. Our findings on the labour-market outcomes of successive generations of migrants are less conclusive. While a larger proportion of LTM children than that of their parents work in the formal sector, the children of migrant heads of households are less likely than those of non-migrants to find formal-sector jobs. We also find that distortionary labour-market regulations appear to diminish the overall benefits of migration.

TI  - Emissions tax in Iran: Incorporating pollution disutility in a welfare analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - The emission of carbon dioxide per unit of GDP for Iran is more than 30% higher than what is available around the world. The present study aims to implement a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model to evaluate the impact of pollutants (NOx, SO2, CO, CO2, CH4 and N2O) emissions tax on their emissions and households' welfare. In welfare analysis, consumer utility maximization is examined based on both standard utility and the pollution incorporated utility functions. Two levels of emission tax known as medium and high emission tax were evaluated. In medium emission tax scenario, tax rates are equal to medium estimates of damage costs while the rates are twice more than the medium estimates in high emission tax. In general, the simulation results indicated a significant effect of emission tax on the pollutant emissions rather than output contraction. However, the effect of taxing on the emission of pollutants increased significantly under incorporating pollution disutility, compared to standard utility alternative, leading to higher welfare and lower emissions. In addition, the emissions of all pollutants in high tax scenario except for CH4 and N2O decreased by at least 20%, compared with their current level at the end of the simulation horizon. Further, the distribution of welfare gains improved under the pollution incorporated option, compared to the standard one as it favored low income and rural groups. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Systemic Impact Evaluation: A Methodology for Complex Agricultural Development Projects. The Case of a Contract Farming Project in Guinea
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - This article presents a mixed-method approach used to analyse the impact of a complex agricultural development project, the SOGUIPAH (Guinean Oil Palms and Rubber Company) project designed to promote oil palm and rubber cultivation in Guinea. At farm level, the combination of a farming system analysis and an economic analysis with a counterfactual scenario enables us to quantify impact on the farmers' income and to account for related impact heterogeneity. These comparisons reveal a somewhat limited impact of the project as a whole, though with a considerable heterogeneity across the types of farm households it reaches.

TI  - Land tenure arrangements and rural-to-urban migration: evidence from implementation of China's rural land contracting law
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE
AB  - This paper studies how land tenure arrangements will shape China's rural land transfer market and labor allocation. Based on data from the Chinese Household Income Project (2002) and the China Family Panel Studies (2010 and 2012), we use fixed effect models and difference-in-differences method to investigate the effects of the implementation of Rural Land Contracting Law on villagers' behavioral patterns in land transfer and rural-to-urban migration. Our empirical evidence shows that the introduction of Rural Land Contracting Law led peasants to actively rent out their contracted land, significantly increasing their agricultural income, and thus reducing the rural-to-urban migration. These findings demonstrate the 'push and pull' migration theory in the Chinese context, and have important policy implications for the ongoing reform of Chinese rural land property rights.

TI  - The heterogeneous effect of shocks on agricultural innovations adoption: Microeconometric evidence from rural Ethiopia
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Theoretically, the relationship between shocks and agricultural innovation adoption could be ambiguous. While shocks could lower the competence and capacity of households to adopt new agricultural innovations, households can also take-up agricultural innovations as a coping mechanism against the different shocks they face. Using a nationally representative household data from Ethiopia of the Living Standards Measurement Study Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (ISMS-ISA) of the World Bank, this paper analyzes the effect of idiosyncratic and covariate shocks on adoption of different agricultural innovations, assuming interdependence among the innovations. We find shocks to have heterogeneous effects on the adoption of agricultural innovations. Specifically, production and health shocks have negative effects on the adoption of high -cost innovations such as improved seeds, chemical fertilizer, and irrigation. However, production shocks are positively associated with low-cost innovations such as organic fertilizer. To enhance farmers' adoption of agricultural innovations, especially high -cost innovations, there is a greater need towards the design of policies and interventions that would reduce household's exposure to production and health shocks.

TI  - Herders' willingness-to-participate in the Grassland Ecological Compensation and Award Policy in China: a meta-analysis
T2  - RANGELAND JOURNAL
AB  - Since implementation of its first phase, the Grassland Ecological Compensation and Award Policy (GECAP; 2011-2015) has significantly influenced participants' livelihoods in China. Willingness-to-participate (WTP) is an important component of successful policy implementation. The effects of influential factors on herders' WTP have received considerable research effort, although no systematic literature review or quantitative analysis has been conducted to provide evidence-based policy insights. Focusing on 3405 observations extracted from 13 empirical studies, this research conducted a meta-analysis and aggregated the effects of factors affecting Chinese herders' WTP in the GECAP. The study also analysed the heterogeneity in influential factors and its sources. Factors increasing herders' WTP included a higher formal education level, a higher farm income from raising livestock, access to larger grassland area, improved grassland condition, and better policy understanding. The cumulative effects of the number of livestock and grassland area on herders' WTP had increased since the policy was implemented. We examined publication bias that may arise from research with favourable results being more likely to be published and found that publication bias was statistically insignificant for the selected case studies. However, we found significant heterogeneity in household income and number of livestock. The sources of heterogeneity included regional differences, publication year, and sampling method. Future policy modification and formulation should better incentivise active participation of herders by targeting specific pastoral regions and herder groups at certain income levels and/or herd size.

TI  - Entrepreneurial Competency of Women Farmers in Nasarawa State, Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION
AB  - This study examined the entrepreneurial competencies among women farmers in Nasarawa State, Nigeria. Specifically, this paper described the characteristics of the respondents, identified the characteristics (type, form and duration) of enterprises the respondents engaged in, and examined their constraints to entrepreneurial development. Structured interview schedule was used to collect relevant information from 165 women farmers selected through multi-stage sampling procedure across 6 local government areas of Nasarawa State. Descriptive statistics (percentages and mean) were used to analyze the data. Most (82.8%) of the women entrepreneur were married, and had less than secondary education (82.3%). Also the mean age, household size and annual income was 39, 8 and (sic)208, 759.38 respectively. Furthermore, the majority (81%) did not belong to their respective business associations. Processing was the major type of business engaged in by many (58.8%) as sole proprietor (87.9%). Persistence, commitment to work contract, and risk-taking ranked highest with a mean score of 2.55, 2.47 and 2.40, respectively among the women entrepreneurial characteristics. Lack of start-up capital (95%), poor infrastructural facilities (93%), and inadequate access to relevant information (89%) were the major constraints to women farmers' entrepreneurial development. Various tiers of government should create the enabling social and physical infrastructure environments to catalyze entrepreneurial development (with special focus for women) in the rural areas.

TI  - Smallholder farmers' use of mobile phone services in central Kenya
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Information and services delivered through mobile phones, 'm-services', have transformative potential to provide rural African farmers with important agro-meteorological information. However, a greater understanding is needed regarding the types of m-services available to farmers, how farmers access that information, and possible factors affecting m-service use. With a study of smallholder farming communities in central Kenya, we examine factors affecting the likelihood of Kenyan farmers' adoption of m-services specifically related to agriculture and livestock information, buying and selling products, and alerts about agricultural or livestock activities. According to a survey of 577 farming households, 98% of respondents own a mobile phone. Approximately 25% use it to access information about agriculture and livestock, 23% access information about buying and selling products, and 18% receive alerts. Personal smartphone ownership increases the likelihood of m-services use (p < .001), as does membership in farmer organizations (p < .001). We find that age and income are not significantly related to m-service use, and we discuss this result in terms of intersections between smartphone ownership, gender, and education. Consistent with prior qualitative research, our quantitative results further support the need for m-services providers to design for basic or feature phone users for improved dissemination of agro-meteorological information.

TI  - Determinants of technical efficiency and farmers' crop choice rationality: A case study of rural Gansu, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN ECONOMICS
AB  - Land exchange based on market transactions in which lessors and lessees participate voluntarily not only makes them better off but also enhances the overall efficiency of land use and agricul-tural production. However, it is worthwhile to empirically explore the effect of land rental on overall technical efficiency in the context of Chinese agriculture because non-farm household producers have increasingly entered the farming business as cultivators. If such producers underperform farm households in terms of efficiency, land consolidation does not necessarily deliver the desired outcome. This study demonstrates that the development of land rental markets improves agricultural technical efficiency at the aggregate level. Another important issue addressed in this study is to examine farmers' crop choice rationality. China offers an interesting case in this respect. This is because, while the central government has long strived to maintain a high grain self-sufficiency rate, the relative prices of farm products have recently moved in favor of non-grain products. Our empirical result suggests that there is room for further increase in farm revenues of Gansu's producers by shifting resources away from cereal toward horticultural production.

TI  - Maize Seed Production in Thailand: Costs, Returns, and Contract Participation
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Thailand has aimed at becoming a "Seed Hub" in the region given that it is the second largest exporter of seed of field crops in Asia. Maize contributes the largest share of seed exports and is the prototype crop for seed industry promotion. One of the goals of the Seed Hub policy is to develop and export high quality Thai brand-name seeds. The structure of the maize seed industry, however, is such that it is concentrated in a few Multinational Companies (MNCs), and the question remains as to whether national and local companies could give farmers the same benefits as the multinational companies. This study aimed at comparing costs and returns across groups of maize seed companies and determining factors associated with farmers' participation in contracts. The results show that despite a higher cost of production, overall, MNCs give farmers the highest net income because of a higher productivity and higher price they give to the farmers from complying with the strict requirements of the contract specifications, followed by national companies, while local companies give the least. Requirements in household labor, investment in irrigation, size of farm, land rent, and age are important factors in farmers' participation in different groups of seed companies.

TI  - DOES CHINA'S RURAL COOPERATIVE MEDICAL SYSTEM ACHIEVE ITS GOALS? EVIDENCE FROM THE CHINA HEALTH SURVEILLANCE BASELINE SURVEY IN 2001
T2  - CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC POLICY
AB  - The Chinese government is in the process of providing health insurance to the uninsured rural population by expanding the rural Cooperative Medical System (CMS) to every rural county. Using the China Health Surveillance Baseline Survey in 2001, we conducted a case study on two CMS pilot programs and investigated whether or not enrolling in these CMS pilot programs has led to an increase in health care utilization and a decrease in the likelihood of catastrophic health spending for rural residents. Matched data sets are produced using propensity score and the instrumental variable (IV) method is used. We have found that the CMS pilot programs have had a significant and positive effect on the probability of seeking medical care and the number of visits. However, the CMS programs did not seem to have had a significant impact on households' out-of-pocket health expenditure and on reducing catastrophic spending. The findings generated from the matched data are consistent with those obtained from the full set of data and those obtained from the IV method. (JEL I18)

TI  - The Effect of Off-Farm Employment on Forestland Transfers in China: A Simultaneous-Equation Tobit Model Estimation
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - China's new round tenure reform has devolved collective forests to individuals on an egalitarian basis. To balance the equity-efficiency dilemma, forestland transfers are highly advocated by policymakers. However, the forestland rental market is still inactive after the reform. To examine the role of off-farm employment in forestland transfers, a simultaneous Tobit system of equations was employed to account for the endogeneity, interdependency, and censoring issues. Accordingly, the Nelson-Olson two-stage procedure, embedded with a multivariate Tobit estimator, was applied to a nationally representative dataset. The estimation results showed that off-farm employment plays a significantly negative role in forestland rent-in, at the 5% risk level. However, off-farm activities had no significant effect on forestland rent-out. Considering China's specific situation, a reasonable explanation is that households hold forestland as a crucial means of social security against the risk of unemployment. In both rent-in and rent-out equations, high transaction costs are one of the main obstacles impeding forestland transfer. A remarkable finding was that forestland transactions occurred with a statistically significant factor equalization effect, which would be helpful to adjust the mismatched labor-land ratio and improve the land-use efficiency.

TI  - Changes in health care utilization and financial protection after integration of the rural and urban social health insurance schemes in Beijing, China
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background China expanded health coverage to residents in informal economic sectors by the rural new cooperative medical scheme (NCMS) for rural population and urban resident basic medical insurance scheme (URBMI) for non-working urban residents. Fragmentation of resident social health insurance schemes exacerbated the health inequity and China started the integration of urban and rural resident medical insurance schemes since 2016. Beijing finished the insurance integration in 2017 and has been implementing a unified urban and rural resident basic medical insurance scheme (URRBMI) since the beginning of 2018. This study aims to examine changes in health care utilization and financial protection after integration of the rural and urban social health insurance schemes. Methods We used household survey data from Beijing Health Services Survey in 2013 and 2018. Respondents who were 15 or older and covered by URBMI, NCMS or URRBMI were included in this study. Our study finally included 8,554 individuals in 2013 and 6,973 individuals in 2018, about 70% of which were rural residents in each year. Descriptive analysis was used to compare the healthcare utilization, healthcare expenditure and incidence of catastrophic health expenditure between different groups. A series of two-part regression models were used to analyze the changes of healthcare utilization, healthcare expenditure and incidence of catastrophic health expenditure. Results From 2013 to 2018, urban-rural disparity in outpatient care utilization seemed widened because urban residents' utilization of outpatient care increased 131% while rural residents' utilization only increased 72%; both rural and urban residents' spending on outpatient care increased about 50%. Utilization of inpatient care changed little and poor residents still used significantly less inpatient care compared with the rich residents. Poor residents still suffered heavily catastrophic health expenditures. Conclusion From 2013 to 2018, residents' utilization of healthcare, especially outpatient care, increased in Beijing. Health insurance reforms increased residents' utilization of healthcare but failed to reduce their healthcare financial burden, especially for poor people. Our study advocates more pro-poor insurance policies and more efforts on the efficiency of health system.

TI  - Neurocysticercosis: a possible cause of epileptiform seizures in people residing in villages served by the Bethanie clinic in the North West Province of South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN VETERINARY ASSOCIATION
AB  - A study to detect human taeniasis and cysticercosis was conducted in 4 village communities served by the Bethanie clinic in the North West Province, based on reports of people being diagnosed there with epileptiform episodes. Many home owners in the villages rear pigs in small numbers for both meat availability and an immediate income from live pig or pig meat sales. The primary aim of the work was to conduct in the study area a census of all small scale pig produce's and a survey of rural village consumers, both by means of a structured questionnaire. The former reviewed pig husbandry practices, slaughter and marketing of pigs and the latter provided information on pork consumption, sanitation as well as people's basic knowledge of Taena solium. Stool samples from consenting participants were screened by a contracted approved laboratory for T. solium. A descriptive analysis of retrospective data was conducted at the Bethanie clinic to determine the proportional morbidity of neurocysticercosis from the medical records of patients diagnosed with seizures in an attempt to establish possible sources of infection and routes of transmission. In addition, the total pig population in the study area was determined more accurately and the prevalence of cysticercosis investigated in pigs subjected to meat inspection at an approved abattoir. The questionnaires revealed a poor understanding of the disease, poor sanitation and hygiene, poor methods of pig husbandry and poor meat inspection and control in rural smallholder communities. There was no significant statistical difference in the proportion of households reporting evidence of epilepsy and owning pigs and those that did not. There is a strong evidence of a tendency towards an association between epilepsy, consumption habits and some identified epidemiological risk factors.

TI  - Evaluating the benefits of organic farming in rice agroecosystems in the Philippines
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB  - Organic rice farming utilized only 33% (39 USD ha(-1)) of the cash capital required to grow a hectare of rice when compared with conventional farm which spent 118 USD ha(-1). This much reduced cash capital expense in organic rice farming relieved women from the burden of sourcing credit to finance crop establishment. Women are in-charge of family finances. Cooperation among members of the family (husband, wife, children) enabled them to cope with the increased labor requirement of organic farming-as in spreading rice straw, preparing and applying compost, hand weeding and picking-up golden snails. All organic rice farmers who participated in the study were members of farmers organization and/or cooperative while only few conventional farmers' were members of farmers' organization. Organic farming improved the soil quality. The paddy soil was loose and had deeper mud which was attributed to the higher soil organic matter (SOM) accumulating as a result of crop residue recycling at 3-4 t ha(-1) and animal manure 1-2 1 ha(-1) crop(-1). Loose and deeper mud led to easier and faster land preparation (26 hrs in CF while 16 hrs in OF), and lesser weed growth which reduced the labor required in hand weeding and time to do rotary weeding. The net revenue in organic farm was higher (332 USD ha(-1)) than in the conventional farm (290 USD ha(-1)) despite the slightly lower yields (3.25 t ha(-1)) in organic compared with the yields obtained ( 3.52 t ha(-1)) in the conventional farms. The higher cash cost in the conventional farms was due mainly to the agrochemical inputs which accounted for 83.2% of the cash cost (fertilizer, 65%; pesticides, 18.2%). The fossil fuel based energy inputs (FFEI) in the organic farms was only 18.3% (546.0 Mcal ha(-1)) of the conventional farms (2,977.21 Meal ha(-1)). For every 1 cal of fossil fuel energy used in the conventional farm, only 4 cal was produced while it was 19 cal in the organic farm. Organic farms were less energy consuming. One tonne of paddy rice utilized only 170 of FFEI while 844 Mcal in the conventional farms. The case Study had shown the socio-economic, energy-use and environmental benefits of organic farming over conventional farming. Thus, national research and extension program for its promotion and widespread adoption by rice farmers in the country should be facilitated.

TI  - Touch thee not: Group conflict, caste power and untouchability in rural India
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - We investigate the impact of community power on the practice of untouchability -the avoidance of physical contact - by upper and backward caste Hindus vis-`a-vis 'scheduled' castes (SCs) in rural India. We hypothesize that an upper or Other Backward caste (OBC) household's propensity to practise untouchability is determined not solely by its own characteristics but, crucially, also by the inter-group distribution of resources across both caste and religious divides, via political contestation over behavioural norms. Our model predicts that greater collective resource endowment (power) of SCs, or that of Muslims and Christians, will reduce the likelihood of an upper caste or OBC household practising untouchability. A marginal redistribution of power from OBCs to upper castes may reduce it as well. Greater power of the combined upper caste and OBC bloc will increase it. Identifying a community's power with its population weighted land share, we find associations consistent with these predictions in data from the India Human Development Survey 2011-12.

TI  - How Community-Based Rangeland Management Achieves Positive Social Outcomes In Mongolia: A Moderated Mediation Analysis
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Evidence-based policy guidance necessary for addressing mixed outcomes of community-based rangeland management (CBRM) is limited, dominated by case studies, and lacking coverage of diverse ecological settings. In remedy, we studied 65 traditional neighborhoods and 77 formally-organized CBRM groups across four ecological zones and investigated how and when CBRM obtains greater social outcomes than non-CBRM neighborhoods. We measured pastoralists' social capital, rangeland management practices, and behavior using a mixed-methods approach including qualitative interviews, focus groups, and quantitative questionnaires of 706 herder households. We applied a conditional process analysis method, novel to CBRM studies, to investigate potential mechanisms by which CBRM affects social outcomes.
   CBRM members used significantly more information sources, had stronger leadership, more opportunities for knowledge exchange, and rules for resource use, which were significantly associated with greater social outcomes including the use of traditional and innovative rangeland and herd management practices, proactive behavior, and social networking. Access to diverse information sources emerged as an important variable related to strong local leadership, knowledge exchange, and setting rules for rangeland use. Ecological context had a strong association with the level of CBRM social outcomes achieved through this process. The statistical effect of CBRM, mediated by information, leadership, knowledge exchange, and rules, was significantly greater on proactive behaviors of desert steppe herders compared to herders in non-desert steppe zones. Further, CBRM mediated by the same four variables, was associated with higher social networking among herders in the mountain and forest steppe, steppe, and desert steppe but not in the eastern steppe. Our findings suggest why CBRM outcomes have been mixed in Mongolia and elsewhere, and point to the importance of accounting for local context in facilitating development of pastoral institutions. Policies to support CBRM should consider prioritizing resource users' access to diverse information, leadership development, and involvement in elaborating community rules for resource management and local forums for information exchange.

TI  - Microfinance and the Rural Poor: Evidence from Thai Village Funds
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This research examines the financial performance of Village and Urban Community Funds (VFs). The study also explores the beneficial effects of the biggest microfinance programs in the world in the lower and lowest income provinces; specifically, whether VFs change household economic status or not. The data is collected uniquely from the village funds in four provinces of each region in Thailand which considerably reflect the government achievement. Accordingly, several financial ratios have been applied to evaluate the financial efficiency of the village funds, and the ordered logit model has been used to estimate the impact on economic variables of the poor. The findings show that the village funds do not improve the savings, income, consumption, and asset of VFs' members, although such funds have a higher financial performance. Furthermore, the VFs are a good substitute compared to the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) credit because the cross-price elasticity of quantity of demand for such loans is positive. In particular, the loans from village funds are insignificantly correlated with the debt, income, asset, and economic status of VF members. This implies that Thai Village Funds do not alleviate definitely the serious problem about the financial situation in rural provinces. Thus, this microfinance does not change the economic well-being of the poor.

TI  - Community Perceptions of a Multilevel Sanitation Behavior Change Intervention in Rural Odisha, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - While latrine coverage is increasing in India, not all household members use their latrines. Cost-effective, culturally appropriate, and theory-informed behavior change interventions are necessary to encourage sustained latrine use by all household members. We qualitatively examined community perceptions of sanitation interventions broadly, along with specific impressions and spillover of community-level activities of the Sundara Grama latrine use behavior change intervention in rural Odisha, India. We conducted sixteen sex-segregated focus group discussions (n= 152) in three intervention and three nonintervention villages and thematically analyzed the data. We found Sundara Grama was well-received by community members and considered educative, but perceptions of impact on latrine use were mixed and varied by activity. Intervention recruitment challenges prevented some, such as women and households belonging to lower castes, from attending activities. Spillover occurred in one of two nonintervention villages, potentially due to positive relations within and between the nonintervention village and nearby intervention village. Community-level sanitation initiatives can be hindered by community divisions, prioritization of household sanitation over community cleanliness, and perceptions of latrine use as a household and individual issue, rather than common good. Community-centered sanitation interventions should assess underlying social divisions, norms, and perceptions of collective efficacy to adapt intervention delivery and activities.

TI  - Impacts of Chinese imports and coping strategies of local producers: the case of small-scale foot wear enterprises in Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MODERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - The footwear sector in Ethiopia is dominated by cheap imports from Asia, particularly from China. This has inflicted heavy impacts on the sector, and threatened its competitiveness in the domestic market. This study examines the impact of imports and coping strategies of firms to withstand the competition. Firm level data were gathered from micro, small and medium footwear enterprises. The findings revealed that Chinese shoes are superior in design, price and quality, with the result that they have taken over the domestic market. The impact of Chinese imports on local producers varied from downsizing, bankruptcy, loss of assets and property, to downgrading activities and informalising operations. Firms have pursued coping strategies that focused on improving design and quality, as well as lowering prices and profit margins. Coping strategies appear to be differentiated by size of firms, and have some association with the performance of firms. The ways forward for local producers should focus on collaborative engagements of stakeholders and government to overcome the competitive disadvantages of firms. Training, technology, quality control, benchmarking and reorganization of production should be designed as a package of intervention. In addition, strengthening local producers to engage in collective actions and promoting exports should also be given proper attention.

TI  - Barriers to commercialise produce for smallholder farmers in Malawi: An interpretive structural modelling approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Smallholder farmers are among the most vulnerable communities in Sub-Saharan Africa, relying on agriculture for subsistence and employment. The transition from subsistence towards commercial agriculture is a focus area to improve the living conditions of farmers in several African countries, including Malawi. However, a number of barriers still prevents the commercialisation of produce by smallholder farmers. This work aims to identify the key barriers faced by Malawian smallholder farmers to commercialise their produce and to identify their root causes in order to prioritise areas of improvement to facilitate market participation for smallholder farmers.Using Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM), the opinions of experts in the field were captured to establish causal and hierarchical relationships among the thirteen identified barriers, which holistically address on-farm and off-farm elements across multiple disciplines, such as agriculture, entrepreneurship, supply chain management, micro- and macro-economy.A causal mapping method is applied for the first time in the context of smallholder farming. This work is novel in identifying in a structured manner and comprehensively analysing barriers to commercialisation of produce for smallholder farmers in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa, offering a causal hierarchical mapping of the relationships between barriers in Malawi.The findings show that 'Poor farmers' group organisation' and 'Lack of market knowledge and understanding' are the most significant barriers, having the highest driving power and aggravating the other barriers. The findings of this work can have a notable contribution to practice. Policy makers and other related actors can have more clarity on the key barriers that affect all others as well as on their impact pathway, thus being able to prioritise their efforts to effectively address them.

TI  - The effects of medical insurance on durables consumption in rural China
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose - The New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS), implemented in China since 2003, has greatly increased the access of the poor to health services and alleviated the hardship caused by catastrophic medical payments. Both the precautionary saving theory and the Buffer-Stock saving theory would predict a positive effect of this event on consumption. The purpose of this paper is to empirically study the effects of medical insurance on durables consumption in rural China.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data, the authors study the effects of medical insurance on durable goods consumption in rural China through a panel binary choice model.
   Findings - It is found that households with medical insurance have a significantly higher level of durables consumption, and their probabilities of purchasing durables increase by 2.0 per cent-4.4 per cent, which support the precautionary saving theory and the Buffer-Stock saving theory.
   Originality/value - Unlike previous studies, the authors focus on the effects of medical insurance on the consumption of durables, which have a big weight in household wealth and are more sensitive to income uncertainty.

TI  - Rebuilding pastoral social-ecological resilience on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in response to changes in policy, economics, and climate
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Economic, policy, and climate changes have profoundly influenced pastoral social-ecological systems on the Tibetan Plateau. Climate change is believed to be leading to increasing extreme weather conditions such as snow disasters and droughts, putting a strain on the rangeland resources herders must have to increase income. Market-based economic reforms and interrelated development policies such as the Rangeland Household Contract Policy, the Ecological Construction Project, and herder settlement Initiatives have increased integration of pastoral regions into modern markets with promotion of tourism, expanded livestock markets, and marketing opportunities for rangeland resources. Although allocating common rangelands to households is the foundation of current rangeland management strategies to achieve these goals, it removes important technologies for coping with high variability in rangeland forage production from the traditional rangeland management portfolio on the Tibetan Plateau. These include shared risk, shared labor, seasonal and yearly herd mobility, and access to diverse areas of rangelands and multiple water sources. Field study of two villages in Guinan County of Qinghai Province, and Ruoergai County of Sichuan Province from 2011 to 2014 found that the villages responded to externally driven policy, economic, and climate changes with an innovative locally adapted quota-based grazing management system that preserves valuable management technologies, conserves rangeland resources, and provides individual opportunities for financial gain. In this way the village social-ecological system has exhibited considerable resiliency, maintaining a form of community governance that functions to manage the rangelands, improve well-being as indicated by livestock productivity, and, according to local perceptions, maintain rangeland condition. The community-based grazing quota system devised by the villages occupies a middle ground between common and individual models for resource use because it focuses more on how to equitably distribute services and utilities from rangelands, instead of how to distribute rangelands.

TI  - Households' Willingness to Contribute to Irrigation Infrastructure in Rural China: The Role of Lineage and Outmigration
T2  - WATER
AB  - Rural areas worldwide are witnessing an increase in outmigration, which has led to an impact on irrigation infrastructure management. In many cases, governments in transition economies find it difficult to support small-scale irrigation infrastructure programs. This research aims to examine the extent to which the recent "lineage revival" in China to increase the importance of lineage networks can reduce the negative effects of outmigration in rural communities. Analyzing a rural community in Sichuan Province, the findings reveal that while there is no significant effect of outmigration on respondents' willingness to contribute toward irrigation infrastructure, and while lineage networks can enhance this willingness, such networks also reduce participation if non-lineage members are among the beneficiaries. Finally, the study provides an understanding of how informal lineage networks may facilitate contribution to irrigation infrastructure.

TI  - Influence of rural labor migration behavior on the transfer of forestland
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING
AB  - This study analyzes the influence mechanism of migration on farmers' forestland transfer behavior by using instrumental variable-Probit and instrumental variable-Tobit models based on survey data of 505 households in 50 villages in 10 sample counties in Jiangxi Province. The results show that the farmers' willingness to transfer forestland is generally not high, but there is a great difference in the influence of intra-county migration and outside-of-county migration on the transfer behavior of farmers. Outside-of-county migration promotes the renting out of forestland and inhibits renting it in, whereas intra-county migration does not affect either. In addition, households' human capital, forestland resource endowments, policy systems, and locational environment factors all have different degrees of influence on farmers' transfer behavior. According to the analysis, improving rural laborers' job skills through training can deepen the reform of collective forestland.
   Recommendations for Resource Managers
   This study uses econometric models to reflect the influence of intra-county migration and outside-of-county migration on households' forestland transfer and provides a foundation for the sustainable development of forestland.
   The factors affecting the renting in or out of forestland strongly differ according to intra- and outside-of-county migration.
   Outside-of-county migration promotes the renting out of forestland and inhibits renting it in, whereas intra-county migration does not affect either.
   To encourage forestland transfer and achieve sustainable forest development, managers should concentrate on improving the rural laborers' job skills through training, continuing the reform of collective forestland, and coordinating the relationship between farmers and forestland.

TI  - Rural-to-urban migration and its implication for new cooperative medical scheme coverage and utilization in China
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: China has been experiencing the largest rural to urban migration in history. Rural-to-urban migrants are those who leave their hometown for another place in order to work or live without changing their hukou status, which is a household registration system in China, categorizing people as either rural residents or urban residents. Rural-to-urban migrants typically find better job opportunities in destination cities, and these pay higher salaries than available in their home regions. This has served to improve the enrollment rates in the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) of rural families, protecting households from falling into poverty due to diseases. However, current regulations stipulate that people who are registered in China's rural hukou can only participate in their local NCMS, which in turn poses barriers when migrants seek medical services in the health facilities of their destination cities. To examine this issue in greater depth, this study examined the associations between migration, economic status of rural households, and NCMS enrollment rate, as well as NCMS utilization of rural-to-urban migrants.
   Methods: A multistage cluster sampling procedure was adopted. Our sample included 9,097 households and 36,720 individuals. Chi-square test and T-test were used to examine differences between the two populations of migrants and non-migrants based on age, gender, marriage status, and highest level of education. Ordinal logistic regression was used to examine the association between migration and household economic status. Binary logistic regression was used to examine the associations between household economic status, migration and enrollment in the NCMS.
   Results: Migration was positively associated with improved household economic status. In households with no migrants, only 11.3% of the population was in the richest quintile, whereas the percentage was more than doubled in households with family members who migrated in 2006. Among those using in-patient medical services, 54.3% of migrants in comparison with 17.5% of non-migrants used out-of-county hospitals, many of which were not designated hospitals (Designated hospitals refer to hospitals where, if people use in patient health care, could receive reimbursement from the NCMS.); and 55.2% of migrants in comparison with 24.6% of non-migrants, who had the NCMS in 2006, received no reimbursement from the NCMS. The three main reasons of not receiving reimbursement were: staying in a hospital not designated by the NCMS, lack of knowledge of NCMS policies, and encountering difficulties obtaining reimbursement.
   Conclusion: Migrants to urban centers improve the economic status of their rural household economic of origin. However, obtaining reimbursement under the current NCMS for the cost of hospital services provided by undesignated providers in urban centers is limited. Addressing this challenge is an emerging policy priority.

TI  - An analysis of contract farming in East Java, Bali, and Lombok, Indonesia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This article examines the emergence and benefits of contract farming in East Java, Bali, and Lombok, Indonesia. After a general review of contract farming in these regions, three contracts, for seed corn in East Java, seed rice in Bali, and broilers in Lombok are described and analyzed using key informant interviews and household survey data. A review of the contracts suggest that there is a wide array of contract types and this is related to the technical requirements of production and the associated costs. Probit analysis is used to identify factors contributing to smallholder participation in farm contracts and a two-stage estimation process used to measure the effects of farm contracts on gross margins and labor use. Results indicate participation in contracts is influenced by farm size and other factors such as smallholder's age, education, and participation in farm groups. Contracts increased returns to capital for the seed corn and broiler contracts but not for the seed rice contract. All three contracts influenced the types of labor used; however, none of them influenced total farm employment.

TI  - Agricultural Cooperatives and Investment in Organic Soil Amendments and Chemical Fertilizer in China
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - In this article, we develop a dynamic model to show how membership in agricultural cooperatives influences smallholder farmers' decisions to invest in organic soil amendments and chemical fertilizer. The model considers management decisions of heterogonous producers within an intertemporal framework, with the decision to join the cooperative assumed to be endogenous. Farm-level data of apple farmers from three provinces in China are used to estimate the impact of cooperative membership on investment in organic soil amendments and chemical fertilizer. A recursive bivariate probit model that accounts for potential endogeneity of cooperative membership and selection bias is employed in the empirical analysis. The empirical results show that cooperative membership exerts a positive and statistically significant impact on the likelihood of investing in organic soil amendments. The findings also reveal that tenure security, human capital, farm size, and access to credit positively and significantly influence the probability of a farmer joining a cooperative and the likelihood of investing in soil quality measures.

TI  - THE FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF MAIZE PRODUCTION AND THE EFFECT OF LAND CONSOLIDATION ON THE PRODUCTIVITY IN RWANDA
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES
AB  - The main objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of land consolidation on the productivity of smallholder maize farmers in Rwanda. The research was conducted in Musanze District with a sample size of 67 farmers known to be adopting Land Consolidation in two sectors namely Cyuve and Nyange whereby the maize crop was grown due to favorable climate. The Cobb-Douglass production function model was used to estimate the productivity in maize production. The results showed that the land under maize cultivation, fertilizers and labor have a significant and positive influence on maize farm productivity; maize seed was not significant but has a partial positive influence on maize yield. On the productivity model, the results showed that age, years of schooling, extension access, and cooperative farming have a significant impact on the productivity but farmer's experience was not significant and positively affected the productivity of maize farmers. The most constraints observed were the lack of adequate market, low price given to maize farmers compared to the cost of production, and price unpredictability of agricultural products. This study proposes strategies such as farmer training programs, raising the educational level of farmers, and providing farmers with greater access to credit, adoption contracting farming where farmers could produce on contractual basis with the known potential buyers and encourage cooperative farming which could increase the bargaining power to afford better prices in order to increase the productivityof fragmented maize farms in the region.

TI  - Why Does Tobacco Agriculture in Thailand Persist?
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
AB  - The rigorous tobacco controls advocated by both international policy players and national government are foreseen to lowering demand in tobacco consumption, and consequently, the contraction of tobacco agriculture. This paper seeks to reveal why tobacco agriculture, albeit with the declining trend of tobacco farms, continues to persist. Theoretical guiding the investigation is based on the institutional arrangement of contract farming system, the idea that derived from New Institution Economics, and farmers' striving to attain livelihoods. The study adopts qualitative methods, utilising purposive sampling, with 53 tobacco farmers recruited from four provinces, namely Phrae, Phetchabun, Roi-et and Nongkhai, who took part in four focus group discussions. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with two provincial agricultural promotion officers, three provincial excise officers and four staff members of the local office of the Thailand Tobacco Monopoly. The data was analysed using content analysis. This paper found that supportive institutional arrangements, the adaptation of communities and households creating a favourable environment and the emergence of new markets for roll-your-own cigarettes are contributing to the persistence of tobacco agriculture. In light of tobacco control, two policy measures are proposed. First, the regulations for roll-your-own cigarette industries - both smallholders and manufacturers - must be revised and instituted. Second, to encourage tobacco farmers to move away from tobacco growing, institutional support for alternative crops, such as price guarantees, inputs and technical support should be provided in the same manner that the tobacco growers currently receive.

TI  - Selling Together: The Benefits of Cooperatives to Women Honey Producers in Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Smallholder farmers in developing countries encounter multiple barriers in access to inputs and technology, which prevent them from reaping the benefits from market participation. Women farmers face additional constraints due to gender norms that further limit their engagement in productive activities. While collective action has been shown to improve access to markets and economic outcomes for farmers overall, the evidence on the effects of cooperative membership for women smallholders remains limited. We investigate empirically the economic benefits of collective action for women farmers in the honey sector in Ethiopia. Relying on a rich data set on women honey producers, both cooperative members and non-members, we evaluate the effects of belonging to a cooperative on three outcome variables through coarsened exact matching and regression analysis. Our results indicate that cooperative membership significantly increases the market price and the production quantity and, while the average effect on the share of product marketed is statistically insignificant, significant differences emerge for women with given characteristics. These results are shown to be robust to a number of tests that address biases from selection on observables and unobservables. An analysis of the heterogeneous effects of household membership in multiple groups finds that membership of self-help groups or farmer associations amplifies the positive outcomes from belonging to a formal cooperative. Finally, qualitative findings derived from the same communities indicate self-reported improvements in agency and self-esteem among women members, thus reinforcing the importance of the quantitative findings.

AB  - Some research have shown that the household responsibility system is the basic agricultural system in China.That has significantly promoted China's agricultural growth.But it causes the phenomenon of land fragmentation.This phenomenon reduces the efficiency of farming.In order to maximum yield, farmers have to use more fertilizer and pesticide.This research suggests that this view is not entirely correct.This research uses data of Guangdong thousand village surveys in 2018, and uses OLS model, quantile model and seemingly unrelated regression model for empirical analysis.We found that farmers will use fertilizers and pesticides in different places according to the cognitive labels of farmland cleanliness.If farmers think the farmland is clean, they will use less fertilizer and pesticide in order to protect the farmland.Contrarily, they will use more fertilizer and pesticide.Who is more susceptible to cognitive labels? The answer is part-time farmers.Because they need to use clean farmland as a carrier for future employment.They will use less fertilizer and pesticide in order to protect the farmland.part-time farmers have a short-term contract, farmland is no longer a guarantee of future employment, they will use more fertilizers and pesticides.

TI  - Direct financial cost of weed control in smallholder rubber plantations
T2  - OPEN AGRICULTURE
AB  - A survey was conducted to provide information on weed types, control strategies, and their estimated costs to smallholder rubber outgrowers in Western Ghana. A total of 80 farmers with rubber trees aged 1-4 years were randomly selected for the study. This represents 10.2% of the total number of farmers (783) who fall within this target group in the districts. The results show that smallholder rubber plantation farmers are dealing with diverse weed species, most of which are reported as global weeds. Chromolaena odorata, Scleria boivinii, and Mimosa pudica were the most reported species. Manual weeding and application of herbicides are the major control methods adopted by the farmers in the study area with a small percentage (16%) also using cover cropping. The two major control methods cost farmers an estimated average amount of Ghc 618.24 +/- 26.25 (US $140.51 +/- 5.91) for one-time weed control per hectare. The average estimated cost of one-time manual weeding per hectare was higher than that of herbicide application per hectare. This estimated amount is only a fraction of the total economic cost of weeds to the farmers. The farmers are likely to spend more if, for example, the costs of yield loss due to weeds are captured. The study thus indicates that the cost of weed management is high for rubber outgrowers and essentially farmers are investing heavily in weed management to keep weed competition on-plantation relatively low. Given that the core objective of rubber growing is to maximize profits, this study recommends the application of herbicides to control weeds in rubber plantations since average estimated cost of herbicide application per hectare was lower than one-time manual weeding per hectare. This recommendation should, however, be weighed against the possible environmental impact of herbicides, which was not assessed in this study.

TI  - Using nature-based water storage for smallholder irrigated agriculture in African drylands: Lessons from frugal innovation pilots in Mozambique and Zimbabwe
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - Alluvial aquifers in seasonal rivers are a yet underutilised resource in many (semi-)arid regions of Africa. These so-called sand river aquifers provide nature-based water storage within easy reach because they are shallow. They form a significant potential renewable source of water for irrigation development. Innovative approaches and solutions are needed to sustainably increase productive use of this resource to enhance rural livelihoods. The A4Labs action research explores the potential and pitfalls of introducing solutions designed for individual smallholder farmers. This entails innovation in three domains: the technology used (manually-installed shallow well-points in or next to a sand river combined with solar-powered water pumps), the arrangement (individual smallholder farmers), and the purpose (market-oriented farming). Pilots were established in the Limpopo river basin in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Monitoring and assessment are ongoing, but preliminary findings indicate that successful adoption of the approach was not constrained by water availability. Despite the fact that these pilots were established during two subsequent drought years, there was no difficulty in accessing freshwater in sufficient quantity. Instead, successful adoption depends on previous farming experience, market access, and the possibility to grow adaptively in terms of technology, scale and financial risks. In addition, establishing an individual farm to grow cash crops requires acceptance and new skills, as irrigation for smallholder farmers in Africa has traditionally been framed as a communal activity in "collective" irrigation schemes with strong support by outside agencies, and with the well-known collective action challenges. This action research has also estimated that the potential for upscaling this innovation in the Limpopo river basin is significant.
   Our innovative solution for accessing water stored in shallow alluvial aquifers can start small, is within reach of smallholder farmers (initial investment being less than US$1,000/0.2 ha), and is scalable as farmers can gradually improve their system and expand. Moreover, the solution allows for the application of "adaptive development pathways" at the river-stretch scale.

TI  - Social Differentiation and the Politics of Land: Sugar Cane Outgrowing in Kilombero, Tanzania
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - The privatisation of formerly state-owned sugar cane estates and mills in the late 1990s led to the reconfiguration of the ownership structure and production of the Tanzanian sugar industry. This included the decentralisation of sugar cane production operations to outgrowers and their associations. Based on an investigation of sugar cane outgrowers of the Kilombero Sugar Company, this article explores the outcomes of this transformation and the dynamics of social differentiation, and the ways in which this is shaped by Tanzania's institutional and legal framework governing the sugar industry. While increased sugar cane production has created jobs and income for some outgrower households, it has also been associated with several adverse impacts. Large-scale outgrowers have rapidly captured the most lucrative business opportunities and the land they require, marginalising smaller outgrowers. This is further exacerbated by heightened competition among farmers and patronage relations affecting the distribution of harvest quotas and cheap sugar imports. The outgrower model is central to national development initiatives such as the Southern Agriculture Growth Corridor of Tanzania and Big Results Now'. Despite the grand ambitions of large-scale agricultural commercialisation, who wins and who loses out depends more on the local political economy, where the sugar industry, local business, political elites and local communities compete for the benefits of expanded sugar production.

TI  - Regulating Over-indebtedness: Local State Power in Cambodia's Microfinance Market
T2  - DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
AB  - Cambodian microfinance borrowers are suffering from an over-indebtedness crisis. In the past 20 years, the Cambodian government has implemented financial reforms that have commercialized the microfinance sector and promoted industry self-regulation. Echoing long-standing concerns about neoliberal microfinance, critics maintain that these reforms have hollowed out the Cambodian state's ability to regulate a highly competitive market, thereby exacerbating the problem of over-indebtedness. In contrast, based upon 20 months of ethnographic research in southern Cambodia by the author, this article argues that the microfinance market would not function without local authorities performing key regulatory roles of the state. These local authorities include commune councillors - elected representatives of multiple villages - who work closely with village leaders and local police. They are the primary state actors who enforce the property rights and loan contracts upon which Cambodia's microfinance market depends. The author analyses how this local state regulation contributes to household indebtedness by encouraging multiple borrowing, rural out-migration and land repossession. The article advances development studies scholarship on over-indebtedness by demonstrating that the inequitable outcomes of neoliberal microfinance can be better understood, and contested, by interrogating the multi-scalar spaces of state regulatory power.

TI  - Evaluating the implementation related challenges of Shasthyo Suroksha Karmasuchi (health protection scheme) of the government of Bangladesh: a study protocol
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Rapidly increasing healthcare costs and the growing burden of non-communicable diseases have increased the out of pocket (OOP) spending (63.3% of total health expenditure) in Bangladesh. This increasing OOP spending for healthcare has catastrophic economic impact on households. To reduce this burden, the Health Economics Unit (HEU) of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has developed the Shasthyo Surokhsha Karmasuchi (SSK) health protection scheme for the below-poverty line (BPL) population. The key actors in the scheme are HEU, contracted scheme operator and hospital. Under this scheme, each enrolled household is provided 50,000 BDT (620 USD) coverage per year for healthcare services against a government financed premium of 1000 BDT (12 USD). This initiative faces some challenges e.g., delays in scheme activities, registering the targeted population, low utilization of services, lack of motivation of the providers, and management related difficulties. It is also important to estimate the financial requirement for nationwide scale up of this project. We aim to identify these implementation related challenges and provide feedback to the project personnel.
   Methods: This is a concurrent process documentation using mixed-method approaches. It will be conducted in the rural Kalihati Upazila where the SSK is being implemented. To validate the BPL population selection process, we will estimate the positive predictive value. A community survey will be conducted to assess the knowledge of the card holders about SSK services. From the SSK information management system, numbers of different services utilized by the card holders will be retrieved. Key-informant interviews with personnel from three key actors will be conducted to understand the barriers in the implementation of the project as per plan and gather their suggestions. To estimate the project costs, all inputs to be used will be identified, quantified and valued. The nationwide scale-up cost of the project will be estimated by applying economic modeling. Discussion: SSK is the fust evei government initiated health protection scheme in Bangladesh. The study findings will enable decision makers to gain a better understanding of the key challenges in implementation of such scheme and provide feedback tovvaids the successful implementation of the program.

TI  - Cross-boundary and cross-level dynamics increase vulnerability to severe winter disasters (dzud) in Mongolia
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Dzud is the Mongolian term for a severe winter weather disaster. With global change dzud may increase in frequency and intensity, placing livestock and livelihoods at risk. We conducted in-depth case studies of dzud impacts and responses in two mountain-steppe and two Gobi desert-steppe districts in Mongolia. We used focus groups, key informant interviews, a household survey and photovoice to document individual and community experiences with dzud and identify the factors that make some households and communities more vulnerable to dzud and others less so. We found that dzud is a complex social-ecological phenomenon and vulnerability to dzud is a function of interacting physical, biological, socio-economic and institutional factors. Vulnerability was affected by factors within and interactions between communities as well as cross-level dynamics. Communities that are well prepared for dzud at the household level may suffer disproportionate losses if exposure is increased by in-migrating livestock from other districts. Relief aid that helps prevent loss of life, suffering and impoverishment in the short-term may contribute to long-term dependence syndromes, social disparities, and lack of initiative on the part of both herders and local government. Based on our findings, we recommend that dzud policies and programs promote: (1) increased individual responsibility for disaster preparedness; (2) greater cooperation and communication on disaster planning and response among different actors within communities and across governance levels; (3) sustained and scaled out investment in building local capacity for collective action through formal herder organizations; and (4) effective cross-level institutions to manage pastoral movements and pastures.

TI  - Health Insurance Benefit Design and Healthcare Utilization in Northern Rural China
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background: Poverty due to illness has become a substantial social problem in rural China since the collapse of the rural Cooperative Medical System in the early 1980s. Although the Chinese government introduced the New Rural Cooperative Medical Schemes (NRCMS) in 2003, the associations between different health insurance benefit package designs and healthcare utilization remain largely unknown. Accordingly, we sought to examine the impact of health insurance benefit design on health care utilization.
   Methods and Findings: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from a household survey of 15,698 members of 4,209 randomly-selected households in 7 provinces, which were representative of the provinces along the north side of the Yellow River. Interviews were conducted face-to-face and in Mandarin. Our analytic sample included 9,762 respondents from 2,642 households. In each household, respondents indicated the type of health insurance benefit that the household had (coverage for inpatient care only or coverage for both inpatient and outpatient care) and the number of outpatient visits in the 30 days preceding the interview and the number of hospitalizations in the 365 days preceding the household interview. People who had both outpatient and inpatient coverage compared with inpatient coverage only had significantly more village-level outpatient visits, township-level outpatient visits, and total outpatient visits. Furthermore, the increased utilization of township and village-level outpatient care was experienced disproportionately by people who were poorer, whereas the increased inpatient utilization overall and at the county level was experienced disproportionately by people who were richer.
   Conclusion: The evidence from this study indicates that the design of health insurance benefits is an important policy tool that can affect the health services utilization and socioeconomic equity in service use at different levels. Without careful design, health insurance may not benefit those who are most in need of financial protection from health services expenses.

TI  - New Round of Collective Forest Rights Reform, Forestland Transfer and Household Production Efficiency
T2  - LAND
AB  - The purpose of this paper was to analyze the influence mechanism of the new round of Collective Forest Rights Reform (CFRR) on farmers' production efficiency from the perspective of forestland transfer. Based on the panel data of field investigation in Jiangxi Province, a panel logit model was used to verify whether the new round of CFRR has affected farmers' forestland circulation behavior. The results showed that the new round of CFRR has played a significant role in promoting forestland circulation. Secondly, the non-parametric DEA method was used to estimate the technical, scale, and comprehensive efficiency of households. DID and panel quantile models were constructed to analyze the impact of forestland inflow policy and forestland outflow policy effects on rural household productivity. The regression results showed that the effect of forestland inflow has had a significantly positive impact on scale and comprehensive efficiency, but it only had a significant effect on technical efficiency in the 0.1 quartile. The effect of forestland outflow was not found to be significant for technical, scale, and comprehensive efficiency, but it was found to be negative for technical efficiency in the 0.75 quartile and negative for scale efficiency in the 0.5 and 0.75 quantiles.

TI  - Property rights, tenure security and forest investment incentives: evidence from China's Collective Forest Tenure Reform
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper assesses how tenure reform in China's collective forest sector affects Chinese farmer households' perception of tenure security and propensity to invest in their forestland. A large database consisting of information from 3,180 households in eight provinces from south to north is used to explore factors correlated with more strongly perceived tenure security and determinants of forest-related investment. The study adds to the limited research testing whether there is endogenous causality between investment and tenure security in forestland, and finds that investment was not undertaken to enhance tenure security. In addition, the data allow for differentiation between perceived tenure security and contracted use and transferability rights. Overall, stronger contracted rights were found to affect investment. China's forest tenure reform - where individual households can manage forestland, empowered by legal certification and stronger contract rights - has thus enhanced tenure security and encouraged forest investment.

TI  - Determinants of Irish potato (Solanum tuberosum) commercialization and market participation by farmers in Nyandarua County, Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH
AB  - Agricultural commercialization has been promoted as a pathway for enhancing household welfare in developing countries. This paper assesses the extent and determinants of commercialization among smallholder potato farming households in Nyandarua County, Kenya. Data were collected through a survey of 388 potato-producing households and analysed using a crop commercialization index (calculated as a share of the value of produced potato that is marketed) and the Tobit regression model. The average commercialization index was 0.4, implying that only a smaller share of the produced potato is marketed. The extent of potato commercialization varied across gender, education level, productivity, size of potato plots, and farmers' knowledge of production and marketing. The findings also show that household characteristics (such as gender (being male), age, education of the household head, household income) and transaction costs (such as distance to the market) negatively influenced potato commercialization. Conversely, the scale of potato production, knowledge of potato produc-tion and marketing, participation in Farmer Field Business School (FFBS) and group membership were positively associated with potato commercialization. Based on the findings, interventions to strengthen women's empowerment and the institutional arrangements for collective action and extension are encouraged.

T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - The importance of social capital and institutional reform is increasingly recognized in current development reporting. This article illustrates the complexity of the institutional environment in which smallholders in developing countries operate and how institutional innovation can contribute to increasing farmers' incomes. A case study of small-scale farmers in the Transkei area of South Africa illustrates the success of new institutional arrangements via a project of the South African wool industry, which aims at improving the livelihoods of farmers by supporting wool production and securing market access. However, possibilities with respect to specialization are limited because of a peculiar institutional environment, in particular a communal land-tenure system.

TI  - Operations, risk, and small firms: Field results from irrigation equipment vendors in Senegal
T2  - PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB  - What are supply chain management challenges in a lower-income economy, and how do managers at smaller firms address them? This field study presents these challenges from the perspective of the 60 managers who run firms selling irrigation equipment in Senegal. By canvasing 35 cities, we gain unique visibility into how private supply chains, on which public officials and smallholder farmers in Africa rely, effectively deliver agricultural goods. The primary challenges for managers in this supply chain are day-to-day risks that are quality and contractual in nature and have financial implications. City size in combination with supplier type, firm size, and manager network determine risk exposure. Firms' efforts to manage the chain are more reactive than proactive and more informal than formal, which reveals an opportunity for public agencies to support supplier and customer coordination. Public decision makers should tailor support to account for the differential risks that city size brings to supply chain management. This support should include not just financing the firms directly but should also entail giving loans to customers, certifying suppliers, and sharing inventory risk with public and nonprofit partners.

TI  - Exploring unobserved heterogeneity in perinatal and neonatal mortality risks: The case of an Italian sharecropping community, 1900-39
T2  - POPULATION STUDIES-A JOURNAL OF DEMOGRAPHY
AB  - Previous researchers have found that traditional determinants explain only a limited part of the variation in perinatal and infant mortality at the family level. In the study reported in this paper, we explored the factors that make the perinatal/neonatal death risk more heterogeneous across families. We estimated logistic regressions with cluster random effects at the maternal level, using data from the Italian village of Granarolo from 1900 to 1939. We estimated the effects of selected predictors on perinatal/neonatal mortality and unexplained inter-family variation. We found that non-rural skilled and lower-skilled workers experienced higher perinatal and neonatal mortality risks. Unexplained heterogeneity at the maternal level was lower for women living in sharecropper families than for those in landless labourer and non-rural worker families. Unexplained perinatal and neonatal mortality components were also due to socio-economic differences and were not necessarily related only to maternal biological features or shared genetic frailty.

TI  - Empirical Study on the Impact of Urban and Rural Resident Basic Medical Insurance on Children's Educational Outcomes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - This paper employs data from the 2016 and 2018 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) to study the impact of participation in Urban and Rural Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URRBMI) on children's educational outcomes by using the logit model, double selection Lasso model, and propensity score matching. It is found that participating in URRBMI has no significant effect on children's Chinese performance, but has a significant negative effect on children's mathematics performance. The negative effect is more obvious for children who participating in the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS). The paper also studies the channel effects of participation in URRBMI on children's educational outcomes trough two different ways. It is noticed that both channel effects are not significant, that is, participation in URRBMI neither improves children's health nor changes household education expenditures.

TI  - Training and Organization Programs Increases Maize Yield and Nitrogen-Use Efficiency in Smallholder Agriculture in China
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
AB  - The knowledge and technologies to achieve both high yield and high N-use efficiency in northern China already existed; however, there has been little progress in their implementation. We hypothesized that their adoption could be improved by offering farmers training programs (TPs, two trainings a year) and organizational and training programs (OTPs, besides training, which also provide in-field guidance and the cooperative purchase of seeds and fertilizers by groups of smallholder farmers.). In this study we evaluated maize (Zea mays L.) yield, N application rates, N-use efficiency (partial factor productivity), net economic gains (defined as the difference between economic return of maize and N fertilizer cost), and technology adoption rate by farmers in a county who were assigned to TP and OTP groups vs. those following conventional farming practices (FPs) during the years 2009 to 2013. For TP and OTP groups of 1668 farmers, maize yield increased significantly by 10 and 18%, respectively, compared with the FP group, as did N-use efficiency (22 and 37%, respectively). This led to signifi cant increase in economic gains of 11 and 20%, in the TP and OTP groups, respectively. The adoption rate of formulated fertilizers, maize hybrid cultivars, and optimized planting density differed significantly between the FP (31, 52, and 43%, respectively), TP (57, 56, and 65%, respectively), and OTP (83, 90, and 78%, respectively) groups. These results demonstrate that innovation and agronomic participatory approaches are essential to improvement of both yield and N-use efficiency in smallholder agriculture in China.

AB  - Access to cheap labour affects Ghanaian smallholder farmers significantly. Such access can be enhanced through mutual labour support. However, it has become necessary to explore how this form of collective action affects farmers' productivity and efficiency. In this study, the impact of access to mutual labour support on productivity and technical efficiency was estimated using data collected from 592 smallholder maize farmers in Northern Ghana. The study uses a translog stochastic production frontier model, while accounting for sample selection bias that may emanate from both observable and unobservable household characteristics. Farmers with access to mutual labour support are significantly more productive and technically efficient than those without, with mean technical efficiency in the range of 0.62-0.71 for farmers with access to mutual labour support and 0.55-0.60 for those without access. Sex, education, spraying machine ownership, farm size, extension visits, access to credit, and membership of farmer-based organisation are significant determinants of access to mutual labour support. Policies to help farmer groups and extension agents promote mutual labour support accessibility among farmers are recommended.

TI  - Effects of Agricultural Cooperative Society on Farmers' Technical Efficiency: Evidence from Stochastic Frontier Analysis
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The impact of agricultural cooperatives on apple farmers' technical efficiency (TE) in China was examined. The cooperatives were divided into two groups: a collective marketing group for farmers and an equivalent non-marketing group that did not provide a marketing service, although other functions remained the same. Using the propensity score matching (PSM) procedure and stochastic production frontier (SPF) modelling, cooperatives' key functions that potentially increase farmers' TE can be identified. The results indicate that membership of either group is positively related to yield. However, cooperatives that were not engaged in marketing achieved higher TE than non-members. This suggests that policy makers should encourage cooperatives to focus on activities that do not include direct marketing to increase TE in apple production in China.

TI  - The Impact of Collective Forestland Tenure Reform on Rural Household Income: The Background of Rural Households' Divergence
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - As the direct subject of collective forestland tenure reform, increasing farmers' income is an important goal of collective forestland tenure reform and the key to sustainable management of forest resources. Based on the survey data of 1276 rural households in 18 counties in 9 provinces, we construct a theoretical analysis framework of the impact of collective forestland tenure reform on household income from the perspective of rural household differentiation and elucidate the mechanism of the effect of collective forestland tenure reform on household income in the context of the rural household differentiation. The results of the empirical analysis show that, firstly, the collective forestland tenure reform significantly increases the total income, forestry income, and off-farm income of rural households, but the effect of income increase differs significantly among different groups of rural households with different income levels, showing the characteristic of "benefitting the rich more than the poor". Secondly, as rural household differentiation deepens, there is a moderating effect of rural household differentiation in the income-raising effect of collective forestland tenure reform, i.e., collective forestland tenure reform has a stronger marginal effect on the forestry income of shallowly differentiated rural households and a weaker marginal effect on their off-farm income compared to deeply differentiated rural households. Finally, the income increase effect of collective forestland tenure reform shows significant situational dependence in both forestland operation scale and human capital endowment. The income-raising effect of collective forestland tenure reform is stronger for forestry income of large operation scale farmers, while it is stronger for off-farm income of small operation scale farmers; the income-raising effect of collective forestland tenure reform is stronger for farmers with high quantity and quality human capital endowment than for farmers with low quantity and quality human capital endowment. Therefore, this paper attempts to provide a policy adjustment idea to deepen the policies related to collective forestland tenure reform by starting from the farmer differentiation side.

TI  - Displaced villagers' adaptation in concentrated resettlement community: A case study of Nanjing, China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - This research examines the socioeconomic transformation and adaptation to urban life among resettled villagers who live in government-designated concentrated resettlement communities, by articulating the interrelated roles played by individual households, resettlement communities, the local state and the market. Principal component analysis and descriptive comparison were conducted to assess resettled villagers' opinions on their economic, social, and environmental adaptations, based on 300 structured survey samples collected from two concentrated resettlement communities in Nanjing. The study argues that legacy from the past rural collective institution, rural land property rights ambiguity, and complicated interests in land conversion all contextualize villager resettlement and adaptation. Post-resettlement adaptation depends on specific geographical, environmental, and economic conditions. An approach open to resettled villagers' opinions and concerns would help to achieve an equitable and sustainable realization of resettled villagers' transformation and adaptation. The research urges that resettlement policy environment now faces two paradigm changes.

TI  - Influence of Latrine Proximity and Type on Tubewell Water Quality and Diarrheal Disease in Bangladesh
T2  - ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS
AB  - Diarrheal diseases are endemic in Bangladesh, where sanitation is poor, and untreated drinking water extracted from shallow (<43m) tubewells could partially contribute to disease propagation. This study measures the effects of local populationenvironment context on tubewell water quality and diarrheal disease incidence. The study site includes six villages in Matlab, Bangladesh, with approximately 12,000 residents. Study data include monthly Escherichia coli concentrations for 100 wells, monthly diarrheal events for all children under five, and a detailed water and sanitation infrastructure database created through a submeter accuracy Global Positioning System survey. We developed sanitation metrics to measure the relationship between tubewell water fecal contamination and estimates of human fecal loadings at varying scales. The relationship between childhood diarrhea and E. coli in drinking water was measured for households that obtained drinking water from survey wells. Results show that tubewells surrounded by unsanitary latrines, latrine-polluted ponds, and higher population densities were more frequently contaminated with fecal coliforms. The analysis also showed that poor sanitation infrastructure might affect childhood diarrheal disease via tubewell contamination. Our findings shed light on the importance of integrating population and environment data to identify circumstances in which shallow well water quality is compromised and children are put at risk of contracting diarrheal diseases. Sanitation interventions should highlight the spatial separation of latrines and drinking water wells to limit contamination.

TI  - The flip-side of social capital: The distinctive influences of trust and mistrust on health in rural China
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - Despite increasing evidence that social capital is positively associated with health, the pathways that link social capital to health are not definitive and invite further investigation. This paper uses household survey data from 22 villages in China in 2002 to test the relationship between social capital and the self-reported health status of the rural population, Focusing on the cognitive dimension of social capital, this paper complements current social capital research by introducing an overlooked distinction between trust and mistrust. Trust and mistrust are measured at the individual and aggregate levels, and the distinct ways in which they affect general and mental health are explored. We adopt an ordered logistic regression using survey procedures in SAS version 9.1 to account for the stratified and clustered data structure. The results suggest that: (1) individual-level trust and mistrust are both associated with self-reported health in rural China - trust is positively associated with both general health and mental health, while mistrust is more powerfully associated with worse mental health: and (2) the effects of individual-level trust and mistrust are dependent oil village context - village-level trust substitutes for individual-level trust, while individual-level mistrust interacts positively with village-level mistrust to affect health. However, an unexpected protective health effect of mistrust is found in certain types of villages, and this unique result has yet to be examined. Overall, this study suggests the conceptual difference between trust and mistrust and the differential mechanisms by which trust and mistrust affect health in rural China, It also suggests that effective policies should aim at enhancing trust collectively or reducing mistrust at the personal level to improve health status in rural areas of China.

TI  - A multi-decadal and social-ecological systems analysis of community waterpoint payment behaviours in rural Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Community-based financing of rural water supply operation and maintenance is a well-established policy principle in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet evidence from over 90,000 waterpoints in five sub-Saharan African countries suggests a majority of communities fail to establish and sustain a revenue collection system. As a result, insufficient finances to repair waterpoints can lead to lengthy downtimes or abandonment, threatening the health and welfare of millions of water users forced to revert to unsafe or distant alternatives. Applying a social-ecological systems framework to community waterpoints in rural Kenya, we empirically assess the prevalence and determinants of financial contributions among water users. The analysis draws on multi-decadal data covering 229 years' worth of water committee financial records consisting of more than 53,000 household payments. Results reveal that non-payment and late payment are prevalent, and payment behaviours are predicted by groundwater quality, waterpoint location, productive water use, and rainfall season. The findings reflect the socio-ecological nature of waterpoint sustainability in rural sub-Saharan Africa and confirm that households are not always willing and able to pay for an improved water supply. This situation is symptomatic of a fundamental operation and maintenance financing challenge that must be addressed if the Sustainable Development Goal of universal access to safe water is to be achieved.

TI  - Informing micro insurance contract design to mitigate climate change catastrophe risks using choice experiments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - The main objective of this paper is to assess demand for catastrophe insurance in one of the most flood-prone developing countries in the world and to estimate rural household willingness-to-pay for different micro insurance policies to reduce catastrophic flood risks and socio-economic vulnerability. A large-scale rural household survey was conducted targeting more than 1200, heads of households in five different risk-prone districts in Bangladesh located along the three major rivers in the country. All of these areas were severely affected by the catastrophic floods in 2004. Novel in this case study is the design of a stated choice experiment that allows testing of the conditions under which rural household heads favour micro flood insurance. Although hypothetical, this provides important indications of rural household demand for different types of micro flood insurance under different contractual design and provision conditions, such as insurance sum and premium. Besides geographical differentiation, tests were also included for market segmentation based on occupational activities. Most interviewed households are interested in micro flood insurance to protect themselves against the negative impacts of catastrophic floods, especially crop insurance. However, as expected, the affordability of insurance premiums plays an important role.

TI  - Supply chains and economic development: Insights from the Indian dairy sector
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - With almost three quarters of the labor force depending on agriculture in India, kick-starting agricultural growth is considered crucial for pro-poor development. More specifically, dairy production - which is labor-intensive but does not heavily rely on access to land - is generally expected to offer better prospects for income growth to the poorest among rural households. However, most policies aimed at increasing dairy production are based on ad hoc observations, with hardly any micro-level evidence. Using a unique primary dataset on 1000 rural households in Andhra Pradesh, this paper investigates the dairy production system, addressing three main research questions: First, we look at the typical profile of a dairy farmer and we find that both family traditions in dairy and owning (even a small piece of) land play a role in determining participation in dairy - while land size does not matter. Second, we show that dairy production is strongly and positively associated with improvement in rural livelihoods, in terms of income per capita, but that this positive relation only holds for larger dairy farms. In a third step, we look at the determinants of farm growth and we find that households having higher shares of graded dairy animals have grown more after 2005. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Exploring the Role of Contiguous Farmland Cultivation and Adoption of No-Tillage Technology in Improving Transferees' Income Structure: Evidence from China
T2  - LAND
AB  - Seasonal alternations of extreme weather such as continuous drought and rare rainstorms significantly influence farmers' adoption of agricultural technologies. Compared with traditional tillage, no-tillage technology has more advantages to cope with extreme weather. It is hypothesized that the cultivation of contiguous farmland is still minimal in spite of the transference of farmland on a large scale in China, which ultimately halts the adoption of no-tillage technology and influences the income of households. The current study used 793 farmland transferees' data from Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces of China to explore this phenomenon empirically. By employing the endogenous switching regression model, the study revealed that contiguous farmland significantly promotes the adoption of no-tillage technology and positively influences households' agricultural and non-agricultural income. Meanwhile, the moderating effect of the stability of farmland rental contracts is explored. Further, it was also found that education level, organizational participation, relationship networks, and information acquisition channels influence the income of transferees who opt for no-tillage technology. The study further revealed that if a transferee who opts for no-tillage technology switches to traditional technology, their agricultural and non-agricultural income will decrease by 0.2893 and 1.6979 ten thousand yuan (RMB), respectively. In contrast, if a transferee who opts for traditional technology then switches to adopt no-tillage technology, their agricultural and non-agricultural income will increase by 0.1919 and 1.3044 ten thousand yuan (RMB), respectively. Conclusively, the current study's empirical findings offer policymakers possible guidelines to devise strategies and encourage transferees to opt for no-tillage applications to increase their families' income.

TI  - IS FAIRTRADE IN COMMERCIAL FARMS JUSTIFIABLE? ITS IMPACT ON COMMERCIAL AND SMALL-SCALE PRODUCERS IN SOUTH AFRICA
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - Fairtrade initially was limited to improving the lives of small-scale and peasant farmers, but later on it embraced commercial farmers, which attracted criticism. While there are a number of justifications for the Fairtrade organization's decision, there are authors who feel that meaningful "fair trade" cannot be achieved with the inclusion of commercial farms. This paper investigates the impact of Fairtrade on commercial farms and small-scale farmer cooperatives in South Africa. Fairtrade on South African commercial farms embraces a number of policy concerns related to land reform, BEE and sustainable development. The results of the study show that when commercial farms are included in the Fairtrade model, communities in which these farmers live benefit from developmental projects. In addition, in some instances, farm workers gain shares in the commercial farms, and benefit from the farm owners' knowledge and capital.

TI  - Adoption of contract farming for managing agricultural risks: a case study in rice production in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose Farmers' risk attitudes and risk perceptions play an essential role in shaping risk management strategies to address risks and uncertainties. Contract farming is considered as one of the feasible approaches to tackle farmers' concerns. However, risk perspectives under various categories have not been included in studies on farmers' preferences for contract farming in the literature, especially in Vietnam. This study aims to determine factors affecting farmers' choices of different contract farming practices. Design/methodology/approach The explanatory factor analysis (EFA) and multinomial logit model (MNL) were applied to explore the impacts of risk perspectives on farmers' preferences for contract farming. Data have been collected from 211 rice farmers in An Giang Province, "the rice bowl" of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Findings The study found that farm size, cooperatives, extension, market access and trust have significantly impacted on contract participation while a delay payment was a barrier for farmers' motivation to opt for the contract. Farmers' contract choices were also influenced by their risk attitudes and perceptions under different risk dimensions. The financial, policy and human risk-averse behavior predisposed farmers to single out the full contract while the policy and human risk-loving and production, market and finance risk-averse respondents were in favor of the marketing contract. Moreover, the findings indicated that the more farmers concerned about risk of weather and market, the more choices for the full contract, whereas the risk perceptions of weather and policy encouraged farmers to use the limited contract. By contrast, farmers who perceived the impacts of risk of diseases/pests and human were likely to adopt the marketing contract. Research limitations/implications This study just focuses on collecting data from farmers' perspective. Future studies involving stakeholders such as enterprises and policy makers are strongly recommended so as to design suitable contracts and enforce contract schemes effectively in Vietnam. Originality/value The findings also contribute to the literature on different types of contracts and the multidimensional aspect of risk for rice production in Vietnam.

TI  - A company-dominated pattern of land consolidation to solve land fragmentation problem and its effectiveness evaluation: A case study in a hilly region of Guangxi Autonomous Region, Southwest China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Since late 1970s, the implementation of the household contracted responsibility system (HCRS) has raised farmers' enthusiasm for production and effectively enhanced China's agricultural productivity. However, the absolutely equal distribution of quantity and quality of farmland has also resulted in the problem of land fragmentation, which has currently become a major obstacle to the realization of economy of scale and agricultural modernization. Land consolidation has traditionally been taken as a necessary approach for solving this problem. This study takes Long'an County of Guangxi Autonomous Region in Southwest China as a case study, to examine the effectiveness of a newly introduced company-dominated model for land consolidation. Contrasted to commonly-adopted government-dominated models, in this model a company would lease scattered farmlands from farmers, and carry out a land consolidation project to merge small plots into large plots, then use consolidated land for scale operation. In this whole process, local governments only play an assistant role by subsidizing the project and supervision. The evaluation results show that after land transfer and consolidation, farmland fragmentation degree in Langwan project area is effectively reduced, with the total number of plots decreasing from 1738 to 92 and the average plot size increasing from 0.11 to 2.00 ha, and plot shape tends to be enlarged and regular, which is conducive to large-scale and mechanized operation. Besides, agricultural infrastructure and soil quality are both improved, which facilitate the implementation and mechanization of field work, such as transportation, irrigation, tillage, pesticides and fertilizers application. The improvement of land productivity and government subsidy kindles entrepreneurial enthusiasm for investment and participation in agriculture, which promoted crop structure transformation from sugarcane to high value-added dragon fruit (pitaya), resulting in a great increase in profit from 5212.5 to 57,000 Yuan/ha/a. Meanwhile, local government can free themselves from the cumbersome work of project design, implementation and supervising scattered individuals. Farmers can also gain revenue from land leasing and employment opportunities on the field provided by the company. This new company-oriented model proves itself as a more efficient and effective approach of incentive-based middle-out strategy to deliver multi-agents, multi-goals benefits, which is in line with recent call for self-organized and collaborative resource governance, and can be extended to other regions and contribute to rural revitalization in China and other countries.

TI  - Economic burden of gastrointestinal cancer under the protection of the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme in a region of rural China with high incidence of oesophageal cancer: cross-sectional survey
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the financial burden of oesophageal cancer under the protection of the new Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) and to provide evidence and suggestions to policymakers in a high-incidence region in China.
   MethodsWe analysed inpatient claim data for oesophageal cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer from 1 January to 31 December 2013. The data were extracted from the NCMS management system of Hua County, Henan Province, a typical high-risk region for oesophageal cancer in China. Cancer-specific health economic indicators were calculated to evaluate the financial burden under the protection of the local NCMS.
   ResultsThe total cost of oesophageal cancer was 2.7-3.6 times higher than that of gastric cancer and colorectal cancer, respectively, due to high incidence of oesophageal cancer. For each hospitalisation to treat oesophageal cancer, the average total cost and out-of-pocket expenses after reimbursement equalled an entire year's gross domestic product per capita and per capita disposable income, respectively, for the local area. The average total cost per hospitalisation for oesophageal cancer increased monotonically with hospital level for surgical hospitalisations, and it increased more rapidly for non-surgical hospitalisations (from $301 to $2589, 860%) than for gastric cancer (from $289 to $1453, 503%) and colorectal cancer (from $359 to $1610, 448%). Vulnerable groups with less access to high-level hospitals were found in different gender and age groups.
   ConclusionsOesophageal cancer imposes serious financial burdens on communities and patients' households in this high-incidence region, and no preferential policy from the local NCMS has been designed to address this issue. A special supportive policy should be developed on the basis of local disease profiles and population characteristics to alleviate the financial burden of populations at high risk for certain high-cost diseases.

TI  - Determinants and opportunities for commercial marketing of beef cattle raised on communally owned natural pastures in South Africa
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the factors influencing smallholder producers' potential to sell cattle and identify marketing opportunities for sustainable beef production in South Africa. A total of 95 structured questionnaires was administered to the Ncorha and Gxwalibomvu communities in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Average cattle herd size per household was higher (P < 0.05) in Ncorha (13.7 +/- 1.9) than in Gxwalibomvu (11.3 +/- 1.9). The logit model showed that households with few members, young farmers, Christians, large cattle herds, low income levels and access to extension services had high potential to sell cattle compared with other households (P < 0.05). Beef branding (similar to 40% of respondents from each community), feedlotting (similar to 30%), group marketing (similar to 25%) and forward contracting (> 5%) were mentioned as potential strategies for improving commercial marketing of cattle in the studied areas. Most producers (70%) indicated their potential and willingness to participate in developing a natural pasture-fed beef brand. Overall, commercial marketing of beef cattle raised on communally owned natural pastures in the surveyed areas in South Africa was largely determined by farmer's demographic characteristics, cattle herd size and access to extension services with branding and feedlotting as the major opportunities for improving sales.

TI  - Do farmers care about climate change? Evidence from five major grain producing areas of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB  - Using a logistic model, this paper empirically investigated farmers' perception of climate change and its determinants based on a field survey of 1 350 rural households across five major grain producing provinces in China. The results show: i) There is an apparent difference in perception levels for long-term temperature and precipitation changes. Specifically, 57.4% of farmers perceived the long-term temperature change correctly, but only 29.7% of farmers perceived the long-term precipitation change correctly; ii) The factors influencing the farmers' perceptions are almost completely different between precipitation and temperature, the former are mostly agriculture related, while latter are mostly non-agriculture related, except for farm size; and iii) Farmers are not expected to pay more attention to long-term precipitation changes over the crop growing seasons, because less than 30% of farmers can correctly perceive long-term precipitation change. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of farmers' perceptions of climate change, the government is recommended to: i) enhance education and training programs; ii) speed up land transfer and expand household land farm size; iii) develop farmer cooperative organizations; iv) invest more in agricultural infrastructure, specifically in major grain producing regions; and v) improve the agricultural environment and increase farming income.

TI  - Does the stability of farmland rental contract & conservation tillage adoption improve family welfare? Empirical insights from Zhangye, China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - China's farmland rental markets have brought new strategies to improve farmland quality by adopting conservation tillage (CT) and improving family welfare. In the existing literature, little attention is given to this phenomenon. Hence, the current research is attempted to explore the family welfare outcome of transferees adopting CT compared with traditional tillage (TT). Data from 652 households have been collected from Zhangye, China, to meet the study objective by employing the endogenous switching regression model (ESR). The results showed that farmland rental contract positively and significantly influences transferees' decision to adopt CT and improve family welfare. The findings further endorsed inverted U-shaped relationships with the optimal turning point of 6.5 and 8 years of the contract period. More importantly, considering the sample selection and endogenous issues of the transferee's decision to adopt CT, the findings further showed that if the transferee adopting CT switch to adopt TT, the welfare level of the family will be decline by 0.1985. And if the transferee adopting TT switch to adopt CT, then it is likely that the welfare level of the family will be rise by 0.1785. The empirical findings of the current study provide guidelines for policy makers to stabilize farmland rental contracts and encourage farmers to opt CT application for the family's overall welfare.

TI  - Herding behavior in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in rural Zimbabwe: The moderating role of health information under heterogeneous household risk perceptions
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy poses a global health threat by potentially delaying the attainment of herd immunity to attenuate infection and transmission. Most governments across the world are engrossed with formulating strategies to surmount conservative group behavior such as vaccine hesitancy typical under risky and uncertain situations such as in the case of COVID-19. This paper examines herding behavior in vaccine hesitancy with a special focus on the moderating role of household access to health information from village health workers under different risk perceptions. We use the 2021 Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee cross-section household national survey consisting of 13, 583 valid observations. Our major findings indicate that herding behavior plays a role in rural households' hesitancy to COVID-19 vaccine inoculation. Furthermore, whilst access to health information from village health workers reduces herding behavior in vaccine hesitancy, it does so more when the household perceives itself to be at high risk of contracting COVID-19. Analysing herding behavior in vaccine hesitancy can help policymakers develop more targeted vaccination strategies, such as promoting access to health information through channels like village health workers, especially for households at high risk of contracting COVID-19.

TI  - Peri-urban villages in Kunming, Southwest China: history of change with dual urban-rural characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURE
AB  - The process of absorbing villages into urban areas in China is of major significance and can follow several paths. Specifically, the dual urban and rural characteristics of villages located close to cities provide new opportunities and constraints for active community engagement. This paper examines two related options through case studies in Kunming, Southwest China, and the interface between the urban and the rural in peri-urban studies. One village was transformed from a collective landholding system into a village shareholding company. In this case, villagers' self-construction and redevelopment activities significantly changed the built environment in the settlement. The second village was transformed into a new urban residential community by property developers. In this process, villagers also had their hukou [household registration] status altered from 'rural' to 'urban'. The study illustrates the variable transition processes between rural and urban in this particular region and highlights the relationship between villagers and their surrounding environment. It is argued that peri-urban spaces in Southwest China retained their distinctiveness and certain rural characteristics despite the integration through the urbanisation process, and that the relationships between villagers and their surrounding built environment are constantly being re-appropriated and reinvented.

TI  - Antibiotic use by backyard food animal producers in Ecuador: a qualitative study
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background Antibiotics are increasingly used throughout the world in food animal production for controlling and preventing disease and for promoting growth. But this trend also has the potential for promoting antibiotic resistance, which represents a threat to human, animal, and environmental health. The use of antibiotics and the potential effects of antibiotic dependence has often been associated with large-scale food animal production. But rural households also engage in small-scale production, often operating literally in backyards. While some small-scale producers use veterinary antibiotics, many do not. This paper examines knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and agricultural practices (KAP) that represent an alternative to dependence on antibiotics. Methods Qualitative field research was based on four focus group discussions (FGDs) with non-indigenous backyard food animal producers in four communities near Quito, Ecuador and two FGDs with veterinarians. FGDs were supplemented by structured observations and key informant interviews. They were recorded with digital audio devices and transcriptions were analyzed independently by two researchers using a three-stage coding procedure. Open coding identifies underlying concepts, while axial coding develops categories and properties, and selective coding integrates the information in order to identify the key dimensions of the collective qualitative data. Results Backyard food animal producers in the Ecuadorian highlands generally do not use antibiotics while rearing small batches of animals and poultry for predominantly non-commercial household consumption. Instead, they rely on low cost traditional veterinary remedies. These practices are informed by their Andean history of agriculture and a belief system whereby physical activity is a holistic lifestyle through which people maintain their health by participating in the physical and spiritual environment. Conclusions Backyard food animal producers in the Ecuadorian highlands implement complex strategies based on both economic calculations and sociocultural underpinnings that shape perceptions, attitudes, and practices. They use traditional veterinary remedies in lieu of antibiotics in most cases because limited production of food animals in small spaces contributes to a predictable household food supply, while at the same time conforming to traditional concepts of human and environmental health.

TI  - Urban-rural differences in catastrophic health expenditure among households with chronic non-communicable disease patients: evidence from China family panel studies
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background The prevalence of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) challenges the Chinese health system reform. Little is known for the differences in catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) between urban and rural households with NCD patients. This study aims to measure the differences above and quantify the contribution of each variable in explaining the urban-rural differences. Methods Unbalanced panel data were obtained from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) conducted between 2012 and 2018. The techniques of Fairlie nonlinear decomposition and Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition were employed to measure the contribution of each independent variable to the urban-rural differences. Results The CHE incidence and intensity of households with NCD patients were significantly higher in rural areas than in urban areas. The urban-rural differences in CHE incidence increased from 8.07% in 2012 to 8.18% in 2018, while the urban-rural differences in CHE intensity decreased from 2.15% in 2012 to 2.05% in 2018. From 2012 to 2018, the disparity explained by household income and self-assessed health status of household head increased to some extent. During the same period, the contribution of education attainment to the urban-rural differences in CHE incidence decreased, while the contribution of education attainment to the urban-rural differences in CHE intensity increased slightly. Conclusions Compared with urban households with NCD patients, rural households with NCD patients had higher risk of incurring CHE and heavier economic burden of diseases. There was no substantial change in urban-rural inequality in the incidence and intensity of CHE in 2018 compared to 2012. Policy interventions should give priority to improving the household income, education attainment and health awareness of rural patients with NCDs.

TI  - Resources, capabilities and competitive advantage of minor export crops farms in Sri Lanka: An empirical investigation
T2  - COMPETITIVENESS REVIEW
AB  - Purpose The agribusiness sector has long been acknowledged as a major source of livelihood to many people in developing countries. Hence, determining the resources and capabilities influencing farm-level competitive advantage are vital to better understand and formulate appropriate strategies to increase the competitiveness ofminor export crops farms. This study aims to understand of the link between resources-capabilities-competitive advantage for appropriate measures to be recommended to enhance the competitive position of the smallholding farms.
   Design/methodology/approach This study adopts the resource-based view in combination with dynamic capabilities. The scope comprises owners of farms who possess experience in commercial cultivation of minor export crops in Sri Lanka. A self-administrated structured questionnaire was used to collect data.
   Findings Based on the responses from 456 farm owners, results of the multiple regression analysis indicate that variables representing resources such as human assets, physical assets, financial assets, institutional capital, collective action and entrepreneurial identity; and dynamic capabilities such as organisational learning, relationship building, quality management and marketing are significantly associated with competitive advantage of the minor export crops farms. Reputation and farm process management capability are the only two insignificant variables. Taken together, the resources and dynamic capabilities investigated explain 89.3 per cent of the variation in competitive advantage, in which 82 per cent is contributed by resources.
   Originality/value The findings provide useful insights not only in terms of understanding the link between resources, dynamic capabilities and competitive advantage but also how resources and capabilities can be channelled and leveraged to bring about competitive advantage to the minor export crops farms. Theoretical and practical implications as well as future research directions are provided.

TI  - Prevalence and Patterns of Tobacco Use in Bangladesh from 2009 to 2012: Evidence from International Tobacco Control (ITC) Study
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Smoking and passive smoking are collectively the biggest preventable cause of death in Bangladesh, with major public health burden of morbidity, disability, mortality and community costs. The available studies of tobacco use in Bangladesh, however, do not necessarily employ nationally representative samples needed to monitor the problem at a national scale. This paper examines the prevalence and patterns of tobacco use among adults in Bangladesh and the changes over time using large nationally representative comparable surveys.
   Methods
   Using data from two enumerations of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Bangladesh Project conducted in 2009 and 2012, prevalence estimates are obtained for all tobacco products by socio-economic determinants and sample types of over 90,000 individuals drawn from over 30,000 households. Household level sample weights are used to obtain nationally representative prevalence estimates and standard errors. Statistical tests of difference in the estimates between two time periods are based on a logistic regression model that accounts for the complex sampling design. Using a multinomial logit model, the time trend in tobacco use status is identified to capture the effects of macro level determinants including changes in tobacco control policies.
   Results
   Between 2009 and 2012, overall tobacco use went down from 42.4% to 36.3%. The decline is more pronounced with respect to smokeless tobacco use than smoking. The prevalence of exclusive cigarette smoking went up from 7.2% to 10.6%; exclusive bidi smoking remained stable at around 2%; while smoking both cigarette and bidi went down from 4.6% to 1.8%; exclusive smokeless tobacco use went down from 20.2% to 16.9%; and both smokeless tobacco use and smoking went down from 8.4% to 5.1%. In general, the prevalence of tobacco use is higher among men, increases from younger to older age groups, and is higher among poorer people. Smoking prevalence is the highest among the slum population, followed by the tribal population, the national population and the border area population, suggesting greater burden of tobacco use among the disadvantaged groups.
   Conclusions
   The overall decline in tobacco use can be viewed as a structural shift in the tobacco market in Bangladesh from low value products such as bidi and smokeless tobacco to high value cigarettes, which is expected with the growth in income and purchasing power of the general population. Despite the reduction in overall tobacco use, the male smoking prevalence in Bangladesh is still high at 37%. The world average of daily smoking among men is 31.1%. The Tobacco Control Act 2005 and the Amendment have yet to make a significant impact in curbing tobacco usage in Bangladesh. The findings in this paper further suggest that the tobacco control policies in Bangladesh need to include targeted interventions to restrain the use of particular types of tobacco products among specific demographic and socio-economic groups of the population, such as smoked tobacco among men, smokeless tobacco among women, and both smoked and smokeless tobacco among those living in rural areas, those in low socio-economic status and those belonging to the tribal and the slum population.

TI  - The role of community-based livestock management institutions in the adoption and scaling up of pigeon peas in Malawi
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Although decades of research show long-duration pigeon peas (PPs) as a best-bet technology that enhances nutrition, soil fertility, crop diversification, food security, climate-change resilience, agroecological sustain ability, and incomes of resource-poor smallholder farmers in Saharan Africa (SSA), PP adoption remains low. This exploratory qualitative study examines obstacles to PP adoption and their relative importance, strategies used to protect PPs from livestock damage, and the conditions that shape the emergence and effectiveness of Community Based Livestock Management (CBLM) arrangements to prevent PP damage. We conducted focus group discussions, participatory rural appraisal (PRA), and key-informant interviews in five communities at different levels and duration of PP adoption, and used theoretical insights from agrarian political economy. Livestock damage was the biggest obstacle to PP growing in new PP sites; poor markets and production factors dominated in the established sites. Individual crop-protection strategies were often time-consuming, costly, and/or ineffective. While chief-based livestock-management systems protected all crops satisfactorily during the rainy season, they were insufficient to protect PPs during the dry season. CBLM arrangements controlled livestock damage and protected PP relatively effectively throughout the year. Implemented only at the relatively established PP-growing sites, CBLM arrangements were most effective at the site (Mpokwa) where PP prices were good and markets reliable, PP was the top or major cash crop, PP growers were powerful and in the majority, and institutions pre-existed for use in CBLM. The findings lead to the following hypothesis: smallholder farmers are likely to invest time and energy in collective livestock-management approaches to prevent damage to pigeon peas when expected economic benefits of adoption exceed perceived costs for most growers, mediated by socioeconomic differentiation and power relations among major stakeholders. Future research should empirically examine determinants of CBLM emergence for PP protection and scale-up.

TI  - China's New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme and Underutilization of Medical Care Among Adults Over 45: Evidence From CHARLS Pilot Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL HEALTH
AB  - PurposeWith its population rapidly aging, China needs prompt action to facilitate the middle-aged and senior citizens' utilization of health care. The New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), a health care reform initiative started in 2003, is currently China's primary insurance program for the rural population.
   MethodsWith a 2-province pilot sample (Gansu, the poorest province, and Zhejiang, one of the richest) of people over age 45 from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), this paper used logistic regressions to examine the association between the coverage of New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme and the underutilization of medical care.
   FindingsAmong those who had a need to visit a health care provider during the previous month, people covered by NCMS were more likely to underutilize outpatient care than the uninsured (Odds Ratio = 5.610, 2.035-15.466). As for those who had a need to be hospitalized in the past year, the association between NCMS coverage and the underutilization of inpatient care was not statistically significant (Odds Ratio = 1.907, 0.335-10.862). Low total household expenditure per capita, living in the inland province of Gansu, and being an urban resident were also associated with underutilizing outpatient care.
   ConclusionFurther research is needed to understand the negative association between NCMS coverage and outpatient care utilization.

TI  - Stakeholder engagement through empowerment: The case of coffee farmers
T2  - BUSINESS ETHICS-A EUROPEAN REVIEW
AB  - While most studies on stakeholder engagement focus on high-power stakeholders (typically, employees), limited attention has been devoted to the engagement of low-power stakeholders. These have been defined as vulnerable stakeholders for their low capacity to influence corporations. Our research is framed around the engagement of low-power stakeholders in the coffee industry who are, paradoxically, critical resource providers for the major roasters. Through the case study of Lavazza-the leading Italian roaster-we investigate empowerment actions addressed to smallholder farmers located in Brazil, India, East Africa, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. We contribute to the theoretical discussion around engagement and empowerment by developing a framework linking together areas of empowerment (defined in the literature) and specific empowerment actions (emerging from our interviews). Our insights shed light on how organizations can design empowerment strategies leading to more effective stakeholder engagement and how empowerment actions can contribute to turn low-power stakeholders into active business partners. We demonstrate that moving from a traditional competitive view of corporate-stakeholder relationships to a stakeholder theory view based on a logic of cooperative partnerships reinforces the idea that stakeholder engagement and empowerment are both entangled with the value creation process.

TI  - Urbanization and Rural-Urban Migration: Toward Involving the Church in Addressing Pro-Poor Urban Housing Challenges in Enugu, Nigeria
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - Policy measures of governments toward addressing urban housing provisions seem to neglect the urban poor, especially in Nigeria. Presently, the world population estimated at 50% urban is aggravated by rural-urban migration. This is true of Enugu city in Nigeria, where urban housing challenges affect the poor residents. Enugu is one of the major Christian populaces in Nigeria where the Catholic Church is conspicuously a fulcrum for socioeconomic attractions. This makes it imperative for the Catholic Church to be involved in addressing pro-poor housing challenges. This study therefore examined urban public housing provision in Enugu metropolis with a view to determine pro-poor housing policy delivery involving the Catholic Church. Mixed research method was adopted. Interviews and observations were conducted randomly within the identified 23 informal/slum or squatter settlements adjourning the 18 formal neighborhoods of Enugu metropolis while the social inclusion theory formed the basis of the study. Findings showed that the identified 118 Catholic parishes also canonically engage in socioeconomic development of the neighborhoods as the available public housing provisions in Enugu were skewed away from the urban majority who are low-income earners. This indicates poor government attention to the housing needs of low-income households who resort to informal/squatter settlements. This article therefore recommends Catholic Church-Government collaboration toward inclusive, holistic, and proactive pro-poor housing delivery in Enugu. Effective utilization of housing cooperative societies, as well as a single-digit interest loan package for housing finance, was also recommended for the Government-Church collaboration to achieve inclusive social housing delivery in the city.

TI  - Understanding the Interdependence and Temporal Dynamics of Smallholders' Adoption of Soil Conservation Practices: Evidence from Nigeria
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The adoption of soil conservation practices is widely recognized as essential in improving soil fertility and promoting climate-smart agriculture in general. Yet, smallholders' adoption of soil conservation practices in Sub-Saharan Africa has not been adequately documented, especially in relation to the interdependence and temporal dynamics of adoption decisions. In this paper, we analyze the interdependence and temporal dynamics of smallholders' adoption of soil conservation practices, such as animal manure, crop residue retention, intercropping, and crop rotation in northern Nigeria. We use data from two rounds of a farm-household panel survey among maize-based farming households and estimate econometric models, including pooled multivariate probit and random effects ordered probit. We found that there is a significant positive correlation between the soil conservation practices, suggesting that adoption decisions for these practices are interrelated and the practices are considered complements by the farmers. We found evidence of inter-temporal variability in the adoption of soil conservation practices, which suggests that some farmers do switch in and out of these practices and may likely explain the often-reported variability in maize yields. Also, we found that the farmers' decisions to adopt soil conservation practices and the intensity of adoption are influenced by several factors, including farmer-, household-, farm-, institutional-, and biophysical-level factors. Yet, the factors that significantly influence the likelihood of adoption differ slightly from those that influence the intensity of adoption. Policy interventions to enhance the adoption intensity of conservation practices should strongly leverage important factors, such as contract farming, crop-livestock integration, and off-farm income diversification.

TI  - Toward Food Sovereignty: Transformative Agroecology and Participatory Action Research With Coffee Smallholder Cooperatives in Mexico and Nicaragua
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - The challenges that coffee smallholder livelihoods face suggest the need to move beyond incremental changes in production. Transformative agroecology offers a potential approach to guide systemic change to achieve food sovereignty among coffee smallholders and cooperatives. This work aims to understand the extent to which diversification practices among coffee smallholders can contribute to a transformative agroecology, and to what extent, participatory action research (PAR) projects may support related transformative processes. The PAR projects described in this paper took place over 3 years with participants associated with two smallholder cooperatives in Mexico, and Nicaragua. After establishing long-term partnerships among cooperatives and universities, we used a PAR approach to guide a mixed methods study that included 338 household surveys, 96 interviews, 44 focus group discussions, and participant observation during farmer-to-farmers exchanges. We found that, although coffee-producing households in both study sites report several diversification activities, more than 50% still face some period of food scarcity each year. In our reflections with farmers and staff from the participating cooperatives, that are also included as co-authors in this study, we conclude that coffee smallholders and cooperatives in both locations are in the early stages of developing a transformative agroecology, as a path toward food sovereignty. Several leverage points to achieve this include land access, native seed conservation, cultural attachment to certain diversification practices, and traditional diets. Some of the more significant challenges to advancing a more transformative agroecology are the prioritization of coffee as a crop (i.e., coffee specialization), and dependency on coffee income. Our PAR project also aimed to contribute to achieving change in the prevailing system through 1) capacity building with community facilitators/promoters, 2) co-creation of questions and knowledge relevant to the strategic planning by coffee cooperatives, 3) sharing farmer-to-farmer pedagogies across territories, and 4) the co-production of popular education material. We conclude that diversification remains an important agroecological strategy for smallholder commodity producers, as a way of achieving food sovereignty. Most of all, we find that achieving diversification is not a linear process, as there are many trade-offs, feedback loops, obstacles and opportunities that should be considered through long-term and collective approaches.

TI  - DETERMINANTS OF MARKET PARTICIPATION AND PARTICIPATION DECISION AMONG TEFF PRODUCERS IN HORO BULUK DISTRICT OF HORO GUDURUWOLLEGA ZONE, ETHIOPIA
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Teff is very essential cereal crop in Ethiopia, especially in Horo Buluk district. It is produced for food and income generating by majority of the respondents. This study was aimed to analyzing factors affecting market participation and participation decision of teff producers in Horo Buluk district. This research was employed the first hand data that gathered from 190 randomly chosen teff producers and double hurdle model was employed to classify the determinants of market participation decision and intensity of participation. In the first hurdle, age, educational status of the household head, perception of farmer on lagged teff market price, number of oxen, chemical fertilizer used, cooperative membership, farm size allocated to teff and family size were found to influence the participation in teff sales considerably. In the 2nd hurdle; schooling level of the household head, number of oxen owned, chemical fertilizer employed, size of land covered by teff and distance from nearest market were found to have significant role in intensity of participation. Working towards improving rural education system, scaling up the family planning program; enhancing access to market and institutional services; and assist the producers to enhance land productivity, where possible, by intensifying farm practices through provision of sustainable and timely availability of inputs are strategies to increase farmers' participation in teff marketing.

TI  - Effects of Decentralized Health-Care Financing on Maternal Care in Indonesia
T2  - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE
AB  - We exploit variation in the design of subnational health-care financing initiatives in Indonesian districts to assess the effects of these local schemes on maternal care from 2004 to 2010. The analysis is based on a district pseudopanel, combining data from a unique survey among District Health Offices with the Indonesian Demographic and Health Surveys, the national socioeconomic household surveys, and the village census. Our results show that these district schemes contribute to an increase in antenatal care visits and the probability of receiving basic recommended antenatal care services for households that are not targeted by the national health insurance programs. We observe a decrease in home births. However, there is no effect on professional assistance at birth. We also observe variation in scheme design across districts as well as constraints to the effectiveness of local schemes. Including antenatal and delivery services explicitly in benefits packages and contracting local rather than national health-care providers increases the effects on maternal care. Increasing population coverage reduces effectiveness, delineating limitations to local funding and risk pooling. Furthermore, we do not find any effects for districts outside Java and Bali, where access to basic health care remains a key policy concern.

TI  - Evidence of Demand for Index Insurance: Experimental Games and Commercial Transactions in Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - We present results of experimental games with smallholder farmers in Tigray, Ethiopia, in 2010, in which participants in the games allocated money across risk management options. One of the options was index insurance that was the same as commercial products sold locally. Participants exhibited clear preferences for insurance contracts with higher frequency payouts and for insurance over other risk management options, including high interest savings. The preference for higher frequency payouts is mirrored in commercial sales of the product, with commercial purchasers paying substantially higher premiums than the minimal, low frequency option available. This combined evidence challenges claims that the very poor universally choose minimal index insurance coverage and supports concerns that demand may outpace supply of responsible insurance products.

TI  - Strengthening collective action to improve marketing performance: evidence from farmer groups in Central Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION & EXTENSION
AB  - Purpose: Several development organisations have implemented programs to enhance smallholder farmers' crop productivity and market access through collective action with mixed results. Therefore, this study examines the drivers of success of collective action initiatives as a pathway to improving farmers marketing performance using data from Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
   Design/methodology/approach: This study uses primary data collected from 30 farmer groups through focus group discussions. These groups are assessed for differences in their marketing performance using descriptive and cluster analysis techniques.
   Findings: Most of the group members are poor (67%) and few are considered as rich (2%) or middle class (28%), while the rest are destitute. The destitute community members are often excluded from the groups due to their own passivity and inability to contribute financial resources for joint activities. Mature farmer groups with strong internal structures and greater participation in product bulking as well as formally organised groups with stable external links significantly have higher marketing performance.
   Practical implications: We recommend that for farmers to maximise the benefits of collective action, supportive policies are necessary to encourage the formation of groups and transform existing ones into business entities to access high-value markets and perhaps even export markets. Farmer groups need to intensify their market research to access ready and stable markets such as supermarkets and institutions with larger volumetric requirements.
   Theoretical implications: The study shows that collective action is important for smallholder farmers in developing countries to sustainably access markets and increase their marketing performance.
   Originality/Value: Few studies have examined how social capital and collective action are utilised to improve smallholder farmers marketing performance, particularly in Central Africa.

TI  - Living without buffers-illustrating climate vulnerability in the Lake Victoria basin
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB  - Exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity are essential, albeit theoretically vague, components of climate vulnerability. This has triggered debate surrounding how these factors can be translated into, and understood in, an empirical context subject to present and future harm. In this article, which draws on extensive fieldwork in the Lake Victoria Basin of Kenya and Tanzania, we illustrate how exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity play out in the context of climate vulnerability and discuss how they interact in situ. Using a mixed methods approach including survey data, rainfall data and a suite of participatory methods, such as focus groups and interactive mapping of seasonal calendars, we identify how climate-induced stressors affect smallholder farmers' well-being and natural resources. Drawing on the seasonal calendar as a heuristic, and climate vulnerability terminology, we illustrate when, where and how these climate-induced stressors converge to constrain farmers' livelihoods. Our analysis indicates that farmers in the basin face a highly uncertain future with discernible, but differentiated, adaptation deficits due to recurring, and potentially worsening, patterns of hardship.

TI  - Simultaneous adoption of risk management strategies to manage the catastrophic risk of maize farmers in Bangladesh
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
AB  - Risk and uncertainty are distinctive features of agricultural cultivation, which significantly affect the production and income. Risk management is an important way for farmers to reduce uncertainty. But little literature is available on simultaneous adoption of different risk management strategies and the possible correlations and impact. This study surveyed 350 maize farmers in four different agro-ecological districts in Bangladesh through stratified random sampling and explored the impacts of social and farm features, farmers' perceptions about catastrophic risk and their attitude towards risk sources, and the possible correlations among contract farming, diversification and agricultural credit as for risk management strategies by employing multivariate probit model. The results confirmed the correlation among the adoptions of different risk management strategies and revealed that a single risk management strategy could encourage farmers to adopt another one or two risk management strategies simultaneously. Furthermore, the findings explored that age, educational status, extension contact, monthly family income, farm size, farmland ownership, and farmers' risk-averse nature were the most influencing factors for risk management strategies adopted. Also, the findings from the multivariate probit model provided further interpretations and information which will help in a better understanding of farmer's behavior about managing different catastrophic risks and will give a platform for policymakers to anticipate suitable risk management strategies for farmers.

TI  - The impacts of observational learning and word-of-mouth learning on farmers' use of biogas in rural Hubei, China: does interpersonal trust play a role?
T2  - ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Background: Residue-based biogas is considered as a renewable energy that should be used to improve energy security and household livelihoods in rural areas. Observational learning and word-of-mouth learning are critical in the dissemination of knowledge about agricultural technologies. Yet, scholars have little understanding of the impacts of these learning methods on farmers' use of residue-based biogas. Using survey data from rural areas of Hubei China, this study estimates the impacts of observational learning and word-of-mouth learning from different subjects (i.e., relatives, neighbors, cadres, cooperative members, and technical instructors) on the use of residue-based biogas by farmers. Additionally, the moderating role of interpersonal trust in these relationships is explored.
   Results: Results from logistic regression models show that observational learning from technical instructors significantly increases farmers' use of biogas. Furthermore, interpersonal trust significantly and positively influences the impact of observational learning on farmers'decisions to use biogas. Similarly, interpersonal trust significantly and positively moderates the influence of positive word-of-mouth learning on farmers' decision to use biogas. In contrast, a negative moderating role exists in the relationship between negative word-of-mouth learning and farmers'decision to use biogas. These impacts are further affirmed by robustness checks.
   Conclusions: The results presented here show that enhancing farmers' interpersonal trust promotes the use of residue-based biogas by farmers. One important implication is that the government might promote the use of residue-based biogas by organizing technology demonstration activities, providing communication platforms, and enhancing mutual trust between farmers and relevant groups.

T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS
AB  - This study examines the relationship between cooperative membership and investments in organic soil amendments in Cameroon. We use switching regressions to reduce selection bias and estimate differential equations for both cooperative members and non-members. Cooperative membership exhibits a positive and significant relationship with the use of organic soil amendments such as farmyard manure and compost. Building on this, we further examine actual-counterfactual relationships where we find cooperative membership to be beneficial to both members and non-members should they be members. We also highlight significant heterogeneities and differential associations in the drivers and constraints of organic soil investments.

TI  - Agrifood system participation and production efficiency among smallholder vegetable farmers in Northern Ghana
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - Formalized marketing arrangements between smallholder farmers and produce buyers are gradually replacing spot market transactions in developing countries due to the rapid structural transformation of agrifood systems. This study examines the impact of agrifood system participation on the total value of vegetable production and technical efficiency (TE), using a sample of 423 vegetable farmers from Northern Ghana. We employ propensity score matching and W. Greene's selection bias-corrected stochastic production frontier methods to correct for observable and unobservable selection bias issues, respectively. We further use a metafrontier model to derive technology gap ratios (TGRs) and meta-TE for agrifood system participants and nonparticipants. The results reveal that agrifood system participants are about 50% more productive than nonparticipants. In addition, participants have higher meta-TE (58% vs. 55%) and TGR (98% vs. 94%) than nonparticipants. Variables such as farmer group membership, extension visits, mobile phone ownership, irrigation and road access are the notable correlates of smallholder farmers' participation in agrifood systems. The total value of vegetable production is significantly influenced by fertilizer, agrochemicals, seeds, irrigation, soil fertility, and location-fixed effects. [EconLit Citations: D24, Q12, Q18]

TI  - A cultural perspective on cooking patterns, energy transfer programmes and determinants of liquefied petroleum gas use in the Andean Peru
T2  - ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - In 2012, the Peruvian government launched the public-private initiative for energy inclusion (FISE) to promote equitable access to subsidised liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders. The objective of this study was to explore cooking patterns, attitudes towards the FISE-programme, and factors influencing LPG use in rural Andean Peru. Forty-eight women from four communities completed a paper-based questionnaire on cooking practices and de-mographic characteristics. They partook in focus group discussions and participant observation sessions. In addi-tion, we conducted 12 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with local authorities, FISE-programme contractor officials and male family heads. Despite the large outreach of the FISE-programme in the region, discrepancies in the administrative practices of public and private partners made it difficult for FISE-beneficiaries to obtain both LPG stoves and FISE-voucher discounts. The complications experienced by households not connected to the electricity grid may serve as an illustration of this lack of coordination. The FISE-programme inclusion criteria required a stable monthly electricity consumption of 30 kW-hours, thus excluding families with prepaid electric-ity meters living in remote areas. Overall, we found that the FISE-programme did not lead to exclusive LPG use in our setting. LPG was the second preferred source of cooking energy after firewood, and women only used LPG for preparing quick meals (e.g. soups) or for reheating meals. The main barriers limiting LPG use included purchasing costs; difficulties completing other daily chores while cooking; technologies not matching local cooking needs; the need to save time; and the perception that LPG affects the taste of food. Peruvian LPG programmes should harmonise their recruitment schemes, and the FISE-programme should modify its criteria to ensure the inclusion of all vulnerable populations. In view of the evidence obtained from other countries and the high prevalence of stove-stacking practices, LPG initiatives in rural Andean Peru merit from incorporating socio-cultural dimensions and alternative cooking technologies adapted to local fuel preferences, food cultures, and cooking demands in order to achieve a sustained LPG transition.

TI  - The Effect of Cooperatives Producing Non-Wood Forest Products on Rural Development: The Example of Kozak Subdistrict Agricultural Development Cooperative in Turkey
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
AB  - Pine nuts from stone pine are important non-wood forest products produced in Turkey. Thus, cooperative organizations engaged in the production and marketing of pine nuts play an important role in the development of forest villages in Turkey. This study reports and evaluates the effect of Kozak Subdistrict Agricultural Development Cooperative on economic development of the township. In this regard, a survey was conducted with 190 participants, and data were evaluated statistically. After villagers participated in this cooperative, forest villagers' income from pine nuts increased and constituted 59.8% of total household income. Although the cooperative has no effect on the animal production of forest villagers, it has positive effects on migration, income level, agricultural production, land used for pine nut cultivation, fuel use and standards of living. Therefore, the number of cooperatives utilizing non-wood forest products should be increased, and efforts should be made to conserve non-wood forest products to increase their added value and sustainable use in the future.

TI  - Farmers' preference for bundled input-output markets and implications for adapted dairy hubs in Tanzania-A choice experiment
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - Dairy business hubs (DBHs) are flexible mechanisms for linking farmers to input and output markets. Yet participation by smallholders in these hubs will only be realized if the hub options are adapted to the needs of farmers. We analyze preference for DBHs in Tanzania using survey data from smallholder dairy producers in Tanga and Morogoro. Applying choice experiment method, we find significant preference for hub options with higher milk prices and payment for milk on a fortnight rather than cash basis. Farmers also prefer options that bundle milk marketing with input provision. For bundled inputs, farmers prefer hub options that allow payment for such inputs via credit or check-off rather than cash. Our analyses also reveal significant heterogeneity in preference among farmers that should be considered in adapting dairy hubs to Tanzania. Emerging dairy hubs in Tanzania should be supported to either establish in-house input provision arrangements or to enter contracts with agro-input dealers in their environs.

TI  - Out-Migration of Muslim Youth from Rural West Bengal to Other States in India: Reasons and Role of Social Networks
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF LABOUR ECONOMICS
AB  - Out-migration of people from rural areas searching for jobs is very prominent among socially backward communities such as Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes and minorities in India. This paper aims to understand the regional pattern of the recent migration of Muslim youth from rural Bengal and examine the reasons for their migration and the role of social networks in developing such migration streams. A field survey that comprises a sample of 2000 migrant households was conducted in the district of Murshidabad, the second-highest Muslim majority district in India. The study found that most migrants mainly migrated to economically better-off states located far away from West Bengal instead of migrating nearby states. The out-migration is related to lack of job opportunities, low income and landlessness in rural areas, whereas the prospects of higher income and better job opportunities in the destination place encourage the Muslim youth to migrate. Furthermore, constructing their own pucca houses in the village is the prime motivating factor behind their migration. Networks within migrant groups, especially friends' contact, are the most important factor in providing necessary information to the potential migrants, whereas contractors help the migrants find jobs at the destination.

TI  - Adoption of weather-index insurance: learning from willingness to pay among a panel of households in rural Ethiopia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - In this article we examine which farmers would be early entrants into weather-index insurance markets in Ethiopia, were such markets to develop on a large scale. We do this by examining the determinants of willingness to pay for weather insurance among 1,400 Ethiopian households that have been tracked for 15 years as part of the Ethiopian Rural household Survey. This provides both historical and current information with which to assess the determinants of demand. We find that educated, wealthier individuals are more likely to purchase insurance. Risk aversion is associated with low insurance take-up suggesting that models of technology adoption can inform the purchase and spread of weather index insurance. We also assess how willingness to pay varied as two key characteristics of the contract were varied and found that basis risk reduces demand for insurance particularly when the price of the contract is high, and that provision of insurance through groups is preferred by female headed households and individuals with lower levels of education.

TI  - Parcelized Cut-and-Carry Agroforestry Systems for Confined Livestock
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - We characterize a parcelized land management system that does not meet traditional co-located agroforestry practices in the tropics. A cut-and-carry agroforestry system for confined livestock emphasizes land utilization as a source of fodder, cutting and carrying feed from parcels to paddocks near a farmer's home. It reduces feed cost by utilizing parcels under private, shared, and/or public ownership. Within cut-and-carry systems, we distinguish between those where parcels are managed as monocrops and traditional co-located agroforestry practices. Primary data for our case study were collected by surveying heads of household in Central Java, Indonesia, and analyzed following a capitals-based rural livelihoods framework. A sample of 122 farmers who managed parcels under co-located agroforestry practices was compared against 50 farmers who implemented parcelized monocropping. Overall, the adoption of cut-and-carry systems supports financial resiliency by limiting cash expenditures, facilitating income diversification, and producing assets that meet planned market opportunities and unforeseen cash needs. Survey results show that farmers who engage in parcelized agroforestry have more farming experience, higher farming income, are located at higher elevations, and live farther from the nearest local market. On-farm income among agroforestry cut-and-carry farmers was on average 11.1% higher than those using a cut-and-carry system but only adopting monocrop practices. Land as a biophysical capital asset under full private-ownership and at higher altitudes, and longer farming experience as a human capital asset, increased the likelihood of adopting parcelized co-located agroforestry practices. Membership in cash-crop cooperatives as a form of social capital asset was associated with a higher likelihood of managing land as parcelized monocrops.

T2  - DISASTERS
AB  - This study sought to learn how women participated in the recovery process after the Kashmir earthquake of October 2005 in Union Council Langarpura, Azad Kashmir state of Pakistan. Focus-group discussions, semi-structured interviews, and participant observations were conducted with a total of 48 participants. The results revealed that women played various important roles in the reproductive, productive, and community spheres, encompassing, inter alia, normal household responsibilities of cooking, cleaning, and caring for cattle, and non-traditional tasks such as rebuilding the home. In addition, they participated in income-generating activities such as carrying construction materials and water for daily wages, dairy farming, and working in fields and in the education and health sectors. Community endeavours, meanwhile, consisted of search and rescue, caring for the injured, collective cooking and food sharing, and supervising the reconstruction of public structures, including schools, roads, and water supply facilities, and establishing a sewing centre to provide vocational training to local women.

TI  - Efficiency of selection for body weight in a cooperative village breeding program of Menz sheep under smallholder farming system
T2  - ANIMAL
AB  - We evaluated the efficiency of selection for body weight in a cooperative village breeding program for Menz sheep of Ethiopia under smallholder farming system. The design of the program involved organizing villagers in a cooperative breeding group to implement selective breeding of their sheep. The program was jump-started through a one-time provision of elite rams from a central nucleus flock, but subsequent replacement rams were selected from within the village flocks. We also evaluated body weight trends in a village where cooperative breeding was not implemented and individual farmers managed their flocks under traditional breeding practices. Under traditional breeding practices, genetic progress over 8 years either stagnated or declined in all the weights recorded. In the cooperative villages, selection differentials of 2.44 and 2.45 kg were achieved in 2010 and 2011 selection seasons, respectively. Birth weight, 3-month weight and 6-month weight increased, respectively, by 0.49, 2.29 and 2.46 kg in the third-generation lambs over the base generation. Improved rams supplied from the central nucleus flock gave an initial genetic lift of 14.4% in the 6-month weight. This was higher than the gain achieved from selection in the village flocks, which was 5.2%. Our results showed that village-based genetic improvement in body weights under smallholder conditions could be feasible if appropriate designs are adopted and that commencing with elite central nucleus rams help jump- start village-based programs.

TI  - Farm types for beef production and their economic success in a mountainous province of northern Vietnam
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the management and economic success of beef production by three types of farm in northwestern Vietnam. The potential of household farms to supply beef for the market and their competition with large farms were examined.
   The fieldwork was done in 2007 on 73 farms consisting of 58 small mixed farms (small farms), 10 medium mixed farms (medium farms) and 5 specialised large-scale beef farms (large farms) in Son La province. The three types of farm differed in ethnicity (Thai, H'mong, and Kinh), remoteness (lowland, highland), production objectives (subsistence, market output), degree of specialization (mixed farm, specialised beef farm) and integration of production (single farmers, cooperative). Data on biological productivity, inputs and outputs, and the social contribution of cattle production were collected by household and key person interviews, participatory rural appraisal tools and cattle body measurements. Economic values were derived by assessment of market or replacement costs. Quantitative data analysis was done with linear models (PROC GLM) in the SAS software (version 9.1).
   Lowland small farms had higher costs for cattle production than the highland farms (0.8 Mill. VND head(-1) year(-1) compared with 0.02 Mill. VND head(-1) year(-1), respectively). The large farms had high production costs, with an average of 2.5-3.6 Mill. VND head(-1) year(-1). Cattle brought high benefits of non-cash values to the household farms. The total revenue from cattle was in the range 4.5-11.5 Mill. VND head(-1) year(-1), which depended on the use of non-market functions of cattle on the household farm. The value of net benefit/kg live weight (LW) of lowland small farms with an average of 39,000 VND/kg LW was significantly higher than that of the medium and small farms in the highlands (26,000 VND/kg LW). However, the small farms kept fewer cattle than the medium farms (average of 2-4 cattle/farm compared with 9 cattle/farm, respectively) because of forage and labour shortages and have no option to further develop cattle production. Keeping larger numbers of cattle based on available natural pasture brought high benefit from stock Value as farm liquidity to only the medium farms. This was the most promising type of farm for future development of beef production, given its actual success and the availability of underutilised resources. Large-scale farms suffered high economic losses of 0.3-1.4 Mill. VND cattle(-1) year(-1), due to the lack of professional management, high feed costs and low animal performance, and showed no potential for developing cattle production. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Distributional impacts of climate change mitigation in Indian electricity: The influence of governance
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Studies that examine the distributional impacts of climate change mitigation policies often neglect the influence of institutions that implement these policies. This study examines the short-term consumption-side distributional impacts of expanding low-carbon electric supply in the state of Maharashtra, India with a focus on the influence of regulatory discretion in pricing. Households' welfare impacts from economy-wide electricity price shocks are simulated against a baseline that is calibrated to actual household economic and electricity service conditions, including actual electricity budgets, block tier prices and supply rationing. Industrial price impacts are propagated to households using a Leontief input output analysis. Regulatory pricing decisions are evaluated based on social welfare metrics for economic efficiency and income inequality. The analysis reveals new linkages between climate change mitigation, electricity policy and income distribution. Low-income households can be shielded from mitigation impacts without losses in aggregate welfare to the extent that regulators can recover mitigation costs through industrial price increases. Regulators' flexibility to distribute costs across households is constrained by industrial customers migration off the grid. Reduced supply interruptions to the rural poor from the resulting demand contraction are a potential co-benefit of mitigation. Distributional impacts, therefore, depend on other electricity policies that are driven by the political economy of the sector. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Family characteristics associated with rural households' willingness to renew the family doctor contract services: a cross-sectional study in Shandong, China
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundIn China, some previous studies have investigated the signing rate and willingness of residents to sign the family doctor contract services (FDCS). Few studies have explored residents' willingness to renew the FDCS. This study is designed to understand the family characteristics difference towards rural households' willingness of maintaining the FDCS.MethodsA total of 823 rural households were included in the analysis. A descriptive analysis was conducted to describe the sample characteristics. The binary logistic regression model was used to explore the family characteristics that influence the renewal willingness for FDCS among rural households in Shandong province, China.ResultsOur study found that about 95.5% rural households had willingness to maintain the FDCS in Shandong, China. Those households with catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) (OR=0.328, 95%CI=0.153-0.703), with highest level of education at graduate or above (OR=0.303, 95%CI=0.123-0.747) were less willing to maintain the FDCS. Those whose households have more than half of the labor force (OR=0.403, 95%CI=0.173-0.941) and those households living in economically higher condition were less willing to maintain the FDCS.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates a significant association between family characteristics (CHE, highest education in households, proportion of the household labor force) and willingness to maintain FDCS among rural households in Shandong, China. Targeted policies should be made for rural residents of identified at-risk families.

TI  - The implementation of decentralised biogas plants in Assam, NE India: The impact and effectiveness of the National Biogas and Manure Management Programme
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - The Indian Government's National Biogas and Manure Management Programme (NBMMP) seeks to deliver renewable energy services to households across the country by facilitating the deployment of family-sized ( < 6 m(3)) anaerobic (biogas) digesters. NBMMP policy is implemented at three levels, from government and state nodal agency, via private contractors to households, creating multiple institutional arrangements. We analysed the scheme in Assam, north-east India, focusing on how policy was implemented across two districts and interviewing stakeholders in rural households, state and nonstate institutions. The top-down, supply-side approach to policy enables government to set targets and require individual states to deploy the scheme, which benefits households who can afford to participate. NBMMP delivered improved energy service outcomes to a majority of households, although the level of knowledge and understanding of the technology amongst users was limited. Training and education of householders, and particularly women, is needed in relation to the maintenance of digesters, feedstock suitability and the environmental and potential livelihood benefits of digestate. A revised bottom-up approach to policy, which highlights the contextual and demand-side issues around adopting the technology, may deliver monetary benefits from market competition and enable development of community-focused microfinance schemes to improve the affordability of biogas systems.

TI  - Governance in the gullies: Democratic responsiveness and leadership in Delhi's slums
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We use detailed ethnographic evidence to design and interpret a broad representative survey of 800 households in Delhi's slums, examining the processes by which residents gain access to formal government services and develop their own (informal) modes of leadership. While ethnically homogeneous slums transplant rural institutions to the city, newer and ethnically diverse slums depend on informal leaders who gain their authority through political connections, education, and network entrepreneurship. Education and political affiliation are more important than seniority in determining a leader's influence. Informal leaders are accessible to all slum dwellers, but formal government figures are most accessed by the wealthy and the well connected. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Potential Supply and Demand of Farmers' Land Contract Rights-Based on 697 Households in Four Provinces of China
T2  - LAND
AB  - A new urbanization and rural revitalization strategy has been implemented in China over a number of years, under which farmers' land contract rights (LCRs) flow inevitably through various means. The practice in reform pilot areas indicates that government funds cannot meet all the needs, so exploring market-based LCR payout paths is important for rural land tenure system reform. The purpose of this study is to answer questions such as the following: How would farmers respond if they were allowed to trade LCRs? Is there an equilibrium point between the potential supply and demand of LCRs? Which factors would affect the potential supply and demand of LCRs? In this study, 697 valid questionnaires from Ningxia, Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces, China, were used for analysis by the multiple bounded discrete choice (MBDC) method and MBDC-Tobit model. The results show that there is a potential market among rural collective households in China, with an equilibrium price of yen 27,800/mu ($59,714.4/ha), and a proportion of farmers who are willing to buy or sell LCRs is around 10.0%. The factors affecting the potential supply and demand of LCRs include land grade, average agricultural income per unit, total money to buy urban houses and cars, age, number of household members with a college education or above, and risk appetite. If the institutional barriers that hinder LCR transactions were eliminated, the potential supply and demand of LCRs would be matched, and the market would provide funds for next-stage reforms.

TI  - Technical efficiency and artisanal fishing households: Any hope in oil extracting locations? Evidence from Nigeria
T2  - SU URUNLERI DERGISI
AB  - Artisanal fishing household's production is investigated using stochastic frontier analysis through Cobb-Douglas production function, which incorporates an inefficiency effects model. Descriptive statistics and profitability index were also used to analyzed the data collected. One hundred and twenty eight households were randomly picked through multistage techniques in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria. Primary data were chosen using structured questionnaire and interview schedule. Results indicates that greater part of respondents were males with an average age of 42 years who were married with household size of 6 persons. Very many of them did not belong to cooperative society with high educational level. The result indicates that labour, baits and capital inputs were significantly related to output. The average technical efficiency was 73%. This means that the households can still improve their efficiency level by 27%. The structure of production suggests that the returns to scale was 0.9584. The estimated gamma parameter was 0.9423 and was significant at 5% level. Access to credit, membership of cooperative society and fishing experience had an inverse relationship with technical inefficiency while age, fishing distance, gender, number of trips and oil spill had a direct relationship with inefficiency. Artisanal fishing was found to be profitable with a net farm income of N135261.21 and a benefit cost ratio (BCR) of N1.20k. The major constraint to artisanal fishing was pollution. Therefore, the study calls for policies that increases the security of oil pipelines in order to stem the tide of oil spillage and invariably water pollution.

TI  - Communitarian cooperative organic rice farming in Hongdong District, South Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - It is often questioned whether sustainable agriculture by smallholder farmers can phase out conventional agriculture. This paper draws on a case study of organic rice farming in Hongdong District, South Korea, and provides insights into communitarian cooperative organic farming, a collective organic farming model. Various organic farming practices (e.g. integrated rice duck farming) have been collectively adopted by small-scale rice farmers in Hongdong since 1994. Organic rice farming in Hongdong is characterised by place-based cooperatives, community-supported agriculture, and strong community leadership. Hongdong has demonstrated that communitarianism and smallholder cooperatives can work for each other complementarily and therefore that communitarian organic farming through smallholder cooperatives is highly operational. The Hongdong organic farming model is of great relevance to other parts of rice-growing Asia, which are dominated by smallholding farmers, in terms of the twin goals of food security and food safety.

TI  - Does Social Relation or Economic Interest Affect the Choice Behavior of Land Lease Agreement in China? Evidence from the Largest Wheat-Producing Henan Province
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - As China is transferring from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, the land market becomes more active. With the rapid transition from an agricultural society to an industrialized society, both economic and social factors could influence the choice of land lease agreement. This paper investigates the choice behavior of land lease agreement based on the household data collected from the largest wheat-producing province in China, Henan province. The results provide strong evidence that economic interest plays a key role in the choice of land lease agreement. Meanwhile, the paper has also found that social relations still affect the choice of land lease agreement. To speed up the transfer of land use rights and scale of operation, this study proposes: reducing the land dependence of rural households; improving agricultural machinery and achieving farming mechanization; creating more non-farm work opportunities for rural laborers; promoting the citizenization of rural households; respecting farmers' choice of contracts; and attaching importance to the role of social relations in farmland transfer.

TI  - Commune Kabuki: Development and Productivity Growth under Maoist China's Rural Collectives
T2  - DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
AB  - The key question for a developing country with a fast-growing population is how to increase savings rates and make productive investments that take advantage of high returns to capital. This study demonstrates that after the disastrous Great Leap Forward (1958-1961), China's commune system administered a nationwide agricultural modernization programme that was able to deliver continuous robust increases in agricultural productivity throughout the 1970s. Through the extraction of household savings primarily via the workpoint remuneration system, China's communes impoverished the local populace while funding investments that increased agricultural production. The workpoint remuneration system constituted a 'kabuki theatre' that used countless meetings about job allocations, work evaluations, and the exchange of points for cash or grain to draw members' attention away from the extraction of their savings and towards the size of their own portion relative to other workers. China's research and extension system, which was nested into the commune and its sub-units, prioritized locally appropriate capital investments and technical innovations that were both labour- and land-saving. These two systems worked together to extract an increasing percentage of household savings and underwrite investments in productive capital and technology that produced a decade of rapid increases in food output.

TI  - Seroprevalence and Associated Risk Factors of Lumpy Skin Disease of Cattle in Selected Districts of Afar Region, Ethiopia
T2  - VETERINARY MEDICINE-RESEARCH AND REPORTS
AB  - Background: Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is one of Ethiopia's most economically significant transboundary livestock illnesses. The disease has a significant economic impact on pastoral household livestock owners, who rely significantly on their cattle as a source of income.Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken in selected districts of Afar region from November 2018 to May 2019 primarily intended to estimate the prevalence of lumpy skin disease serologically in local Afar cattle as well as identify potential associated factors. A multistage sampling method was employed to select study districts, peasant association, herd size and study units. A total of 384 sera were processed using serum neutralization test (SNT) method to detect antibodies against lumpy skin disease virus. Relevant data were refined and further analyzed using stata version 14.Results: In the study districts, the overall animal level seroprevalence was found to be 7.6% (N = 29/384; 95% confidence interval: 4.90-10.20) and the overall herd level prevalence was found to be 20.8% (n = 15/72; 95% confidence interval: 11.42-30.18). Only district was shown to be statistically significant (P = 0.004) in terms of LSD occurrence among the relevant factors studied. Cattle in Chifra district were 20.18 times more likely to contract LSD infection than cattle in Dubti district, when Asayita district was used as the reference group.Conclusion: The present study finding confirmed the presence of the disease in the study districts of afar region and coordinated intervention set to be in place.

TI  - Cashew contract farming in Ghana: implications on farm performance and household welfare
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose Efforts to reduce farmers' market risks and improve buyers' access to farm commodities have encouraged contract farming (CF) in Ghana's cashew sector in recent years. Consequently, the existence of CF shows that farmers who use it may be benefiting from it, as it is their economic responsibility to decide how to sell agricultural products. However, the magnitudes of these benefits or otherwise have been inadequately explored. This paper aims to empirically estimate the impact of CF on farm performance and welfare of smallholder cashew farmers. Design/methodology/approach The study used probit-two-stage least square (probit-2sls) as a primary estimator to account for self-selection bias and endogeneity that could arise from both observed and unobserved heterogeneities among farming households to estimate the causal effects of CF on farm performance and household welfare. Findings The results indicated that participation in CF contribute significantly to the gains in farm performance (price margins, yields and net farm revenue) and welfare (consumption expenditure per capita), and that the non-participants of CF would have benefited substantially if they had participated. An analysis of the farm size disaggregated into small, medium and large with regards to the outcome variables produces mixed results. Research limitations/implications It can be concluded that participating in CF enhances farm performance and household welfare. Originality/value While many other studies do not account for changes in farm performance and welfare due to differences in farm size or other observed factors, this study fills a crucial void.

TI  - Providing health insurance in rural China: From research to policy
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLITICS POLICY AND LAW
AB  - The focus of this case study is utilizing research to influence policy in a large developing country. Our experiences involve the lack of health insurance for China's rural populations and how our research helped shape China's recent policy attention and efforts on this issue. More than 80 percent of China's 700 million rural residents have no health insurance. This has been the case for the past thirty years, since the collapse of the once-successful Rural Cooperative Medical System after the economic reforms of the early 1980s. In 2002, the Chinese government announced a new rural health financing policy to provide health insurance for its rural populations, financed by a matching fund with contributions from central and local governments, as well as from individual households. This article documents the authors' experiences in addressing several critical questions for converting research results into policy actions, including the following: How are researchers to address policy relevant questions? How are they to acquire the attention of top policy makers to a specific problem? When is the issue at hand serious but not yet critical? And lastly, how are researchers to develop policy recommendations that stand a good chance of being accepted and enacted? Major lessons learned include the need to better understand the mandates and institutional constraints of the policy makers, the appropriateness of timing of both research result and policy efforts, how to use a country's cultural context to garner support of the government, how to enhance the policy's impact by combining formal and informal channels of communication for research dissemination, and the importance of following the policy process through the implementation phase to ensure the original objectives are achieved.

TI  - Sustainably improving Kenya's coffee production needs more participation of younger farmers with diversified income
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Kenya's Arabica coffee is highly rated in the world and is a major source of income for over half a million smallholder farmers. Production has declined by 50% over the past 25 years despite efforts by initiatives. This study tries to unravel what drives coffee production in Kenya. Data were collected on six cooperatives through household interviews and discussions with farmers, cooperative officials, and key informants. Yields ranged from ten to 3889 kg/ha/year, averaged 474 kg/ha/year and were positively correlated with intensity of crop management (r = 0.09, P < 0.05). Coffee represented about 25-50% of total household income. The oldest farmers (average 63 years) were poorer, had less diversified income sources and managed coffee less intensively than younger farmers. Intensity of management differed among cooperatives and was positively correlated with trust in the cooperative (r = 0.209, P < 0.001). Households that received credit from marketers were 30% more likely to use fertilizers than other households. We show that the yield gap can be closed by existing practices, and intensification is influenced by household characteristics and services received. We conclude that increasing the participation of young farmers in coffee production and creating an enabling environment for intensification can have a positive and sustainable effect on national production.

TI  - Harnessing of Social Capital as a Determinant for Climate Change Adaptation in Mazungunye Communal Lands in Bikita, Zimbabwe
T2  - SCIENTIFICA
AB  - The livelihoods of rural people have been plagued by the precarious impacts of climate change-related disasters manifesting through floods, heat waves, droughts, cyclones, and erratic temperatures. However, they have not remained passive victims to these impacts. In light of this, rural people are on record of employing a plethora of adaptation strategies to cushion their livelihoods from climate change impacts. In this vew, the role of social capital as a determinant of climate change adaptation is underexplored. Little attention has been paid to how social capital fostered through trust and cooperation amongst rural households and communities is essential for climate change adaptation. This study explored how people in Mazungunye communal lands are embracing social capital to adapt to climate change impacts. The researchers adopted a qualitative research approach guided by the descriptive research design. The population of the study was gathered through simple random and purposive sampling techniques. Accordingly, the population sample consisted of 25 research participants drawn from members of the community following the simple random and purposive sampling techniques. In-depth individual interviews and focus group discussions were used to collect data. Data were analysed through the Thematic Content Analysis. This study established that different forms of social capital are being embraced by the community members to withstand the effects of climate change. These include village savings clubs (fushai), chief's granary (Zunde raMambo), collective field work (nhimbe), and destocking of livestock (kuronzera) strategies. These strategies illustrate community reliance on indigenous knowledge adaptation strategies as a community response to impacts of climate change on their livelihoods.

TI  - The structure and changes of China's land system
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the structure and changes of China's land system. To achieve this aim, the paper is divided into four parts. The first part gives a brief introduction to the structural characteristics of the Chinese land institutional arrangements; the second part analyzes the reform process of the land system in the past 40 years and its path of change; the third part engages the discussion about the historic contribution made by the land institutional change to rapid economic growth and structural changes; and the final part is conclusion and some policy implications. Design/methodology/approach After 40 years of reforms and opening up, China has not only created a growth miracle unparalleled for any major country in human history, but also transformed itself from a rural to an urban society. Behind this great transformation is a systemic reform in land institutions. Rural land institutions went from collectively owned to household responsibility system, thereby protecting farmers' land rights. This process resulted in long-term sustainable growth in China's agriculture, a massive rural-urban migration and a historical agricultural transformation. The conversion of agricultural land to non-agricultural uses and the introduction of market mechanisms made land a policy tool in driving high economic growth, industrialization and urbanization. Findings Research shows that the role of land and its relationship with the economy will inevitably change as China's economy enters a new stage of medium-to-high speed growth. With economic restructuring, low-cost industrial land will be less effective. Urbanization is also shifting from rapid expansion to endogenous growth so that returns on land capitalization will decrease and risks will increase. Therefore, China must abandon land-dependent growth model through deepening land reforms and adapt a new pattern of economic development. Originality/value This paper gives a brief introduction to the structural characteristics of the Chinese land institutional arrangements, analyzes the reform process of the land system in the past 40 years and its path of change, and evaluates the historic contribution made by the land institutional change to rapid economic growth and structural changes.

TI  - Awareness and participation in input credit scheme: evidence from smallholder rice farmers in Ghana's North East region
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING COMMUNITIES-PEOPLE AND PLACES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
AB  - PurposeOutgrower scheme as a contractual agreement between farmers and some funding entities has in recent times found proliferation among resource poor farmers in Ghana, especially in northern Ghana. This contractual arrangement, which involves the provision of farm inputs, and in some cases, technical support by the implementing company and the repayment by farmers with portions of their harvest, is often regarded as an effective way to mutually improve the outcomes of both smallholder farmers and outgrower companies. The study aims to analyse. the level of awareness, nature of input package, determinants of participation and intensity of participation in input credit scheme by smallholder rice farmers in the Mamprugu Moagduri District of Ghana's North East Region, using the Integrated Water Management and Agriculture Development (IWAD) scheme as a case. Design/methodology/approachUsing a quantitative analytical approach, the study gathers information from 233 randomly selected smallholder rice farmers consisting of 150 participants and 83 non-participants using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, as well as the Tobit model, are the methods used in the analysis. FindingsThe results show that while factors such as age, marital status, number of dependents and farming experience only influenced participation in the scheme, religion, age, sex, number of dependents and farming experience influenced intensity of participation. Originality/valueThis study calls for the adoption of sustainable approaches by input credit companies in their credit support to smallholder farmers rather than the current ad hoc support during each cropping season.

T2  - URBAN STUDIES
AB  - This paper evaluates the popularly adopted recent land development programme under 'increasing versus decreasing balance' policy in China to boost inclusive development of the urban and rural in the face of rapid urbanisation. We distinguish two types of increasing versus decreasing balance land programmes based on the different ways they manage land development rights and offer qualitative and quantitative evidence of the programme effects on village development and household welfare. We show that both programmes provide rural households with better access to urban-equivalent services and spaces, while different approaches to managing land development rights play different roles in market access and household income. To promote more inclusive urbanisation, governments and rural collectives should balance short-term economic benefits and long-term development potential and adopt proper land management programmes according to their own conditions. Practical policies are suggested for China and other developing regions faced with land use pressures under inevitable urbanisation.

TI  - Agriculture under changing climate conditions and adaptation options in the Koshi Basin
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Using biophysical and social analysis methods, this paper evaluated agricultural practices under changing climate in the Koshi Basin and assessed adaptation options. Agricultural trend analysis showed that in the recent three to four decades, the total cultivated area had declined in all parts of the basin except in the Nepal Mountain Region. Household survey results also confirmed such decline and further revealed shifts towards non-agricultural activities. Climate trend analysis showed changes in the frequency of wet and dry days in study districts, implying an increasing chance of flood and drought events. Household surveys further revealed that, in general, people perceived a decline in agricultural water availability and an increase in drought and flood events. The direct impacts of these changes were reduced crop yield, increased fallow lands, displacement of people from settlement areas, sedimentation of cultivable land and damage to properties. Household surveys showed that despite the perceived impacts on agriculture and livelihoods, only limited adaptation options are currently practised. Adaptation efforts are constrained by several factors, including: finance; technical knowledge; lack of awareness about adaptation options; lack of collective action; unclear property rights; and ineffective role of state agencies.

TI  - Factors affecting adoption of technical, organisational and institutional dairy innovations in selected milksheds in Kenya
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - Technical dairy innovations (TDI), such as improved cow feeding, health management and genetic improvement, could boost milk production. At the same time, organisational and institutional dairy innovations (OIDI), including group milk sales, feed and credit access, could boost dairy supply chain efficiency. This study examined the TDI adoption determinants and the OIDI adoption intensity. Data were collected from 1146 farmers (410, 382 and 354 in the milksheds of Mukurweini Wakulima Dairy Limited [MWDL], Happy Cow Limited [HCL] and New Kenya Co-operative Creameries [NKCC], respectively) and analysed using a double hurdle model. Access to credit positively influenced the TDI adoption in the three milksheds. Adoption of TDI was influenced by hired employees, dairy records, total dairy cows and household head education. The empirical evidence from the study supports the observation that OIDI adoption intensity is influenced by income, farm size, dairy records, and dairy information access. To boost TDI adoption, the dairy development partners should link cooperative society members with agricultural credit lenders. Additionally, the dissemination of dairy information to farmers by the dairy stakeholders could spur TDI adoption, while providing dairy information and training farmers on dairy record keeping should be promoted to boost TDI and OIDI adoption.

TI  - Impact of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme on the Rural Residents' Hospitalization Medical Expenses: A Five-Year Survey Study for the Jiangxi Province in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - This survey study was conducted to understand the effect of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) on farmers' medical expenses through comparing the information from five investigations and to obtain a scientific basis for a more applicable NCMS. The survey was carried out through interviewing farmers in their homes. The multi-phase stratified cluster random sampling was adopted to select 3 counties from all 92 counties of the Jiangxi province, 9 townships from the 3 selected counties, 27 villages from the selected 9 townships, and 60 families from each village between 2006 and 2014, and a longitudinal comparative analysis was conducted. The numbers of households/overall sample for the five years were 1924/8082, 1879/8015, 1885/7506, 1890/7857, and 1896/7811, respectively. We collected family members' social demographic characteristics, health resources, and peoples' health and medical expenses and reimbursement of each family member. The adjusted hospitalization expenses per capita of township hospitals and county hospitals were totally on a rising trend. However, the costs of tertiary hospitals were on a decreasing tendency. In addition, the expenses for county hospitalization per admission were on an upward trend in general. Furthermore, the total hospitalization expenses and reimbursement per capita (the insurance paid out for the hospitalization expenses) were also all on an upward trend. The proportion of reimbursement also had a tendency of increasing from 24.41% in 2006 to 41.34% in 2014. The costs paid from farmers' pockets were fluctuated, but in general all lower than the costs in 2006. Furthermore, the percentage of hospitalization expenses from farmers' annual incomes gradually decreased each year from 56.38% in 2006 to 26.58% in 2014. NCMS program has had an obvious impact on the hospitalization expenses in the Jiangxi rural area. It reduced the hospitalization expenses of the tertiary hospitals significantly. In addition, the program has also encouraged farmers to get more health care. However, there are still some shortages associated with present construction of the NCMS. Hence, there is a need for local government to continue to take effective countermeasures to control the rising trend of hospitalization expense.

TI  - Persistence of land reallocations in Chinese villages: The role of village democracy and households' knowledge of policy
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Land reallocations have been severely restricted in rural China since 1998. Nevertheless, land continues to be reallocated in some regions. Little is known about the forces behind the persistence of land reallocations. In this paper we argue that village self-governance rules affect the implementation of national laws and regulations, and that the election of village leaders and villagers' knowledge of relevant policies are major forces in the use of village self-governance rules for land reallocations. Estimation results based on primary data collected from 124 villages in four provinces in 2015 and 2016 provide evidence that both village democracy and households' knowledge of the Rural Land Contract Law (RLCL) positively affect the incidence of land reallocations.

TI  - Bridging scenario planning and backcasting: A Q-analysis of divergent stakeholder priorities for future landscapes
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
AB  - Many landscapes in sub-Saharan Africa have undergone rapid changes, often with negative social and ecological impacts. Avoiding (or reversing) such negative impacts requires proactive landscape planning. Scenario planning, a participatory approach that generates narratives of plausible landscape change trajectories in the future, has been widely used to support landscape planning and decisions. However, not least because of challenges arising from group dynamics, few examples exist where backcasting-the collective envisioning of a desirable future landscape and the identification of pathways to reach that future-has been applied in landscape planning. In this study, building on past scenario planning work in southwestern Ethiopia, we begin to fill this empirical and methodological gap. Specifically, we used the Q-methodology to elucidate stakeholders' divergent landscape aspirations in a case study in southwestern Ethiopia. Our results show that many stakeholders share a similar vision of building a future landscape that supports smallholder-based development. However, details in the envisaged pathways differ between stakeholders. Three distinct pathways were prioritized by different stakeholders: (1) Agroecological production, (2) Coffee investment and (3) Intensive food crop production. Accounting for these divergent aspirations is important when taking further steps in landscape planning. We show how using the Q-methodology as a subjective assessment of stakeholders' landscape priorities can facilitate the integration of backcasting within the normative process of landscape planning. Our approach thus helps navigate conflicting stakeholders' preferences and based on that, carefully plan collective action towards a shared landscape vision.

TI  - Sanitation behavior among schoolchildren in a multi-ethnic area of Northern rural Vietnam
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: In Vietnam, efforts are underway to improve latrine use in rural and remote areas with particular focus on increasing coverage of sanitation in schools. However, there is a lack of information on how the school program affects latrine use by schoolchildren and at community level. This paper analyzes sanitation use among schoolchildren in a multi-ethnic area to inform future school-based sanitation promotion programmes.
   Methods: A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was applied during a 5 months period in six primary and secondary schools and in the homes of schoolchildren in four different ethnic villages in Northern rural Vietnam. Using a structured questionnaire, 319 children were interviewed face-to-face to collect quantitative data. Qualitative methods included extensive observations at schools and in the homes of 20 children, a single day's diary writings of 234 children, in-depth interviews with children (20), their parents (20) and school staff (10), and focus group discussions with parents (4) and teachers (6), and picture drawing with children (12).
   Results: All surveyed schools had student latrines. However, the observed schoolchildren most commonly urinated and defecated in the open. Main barriers for latrine use included inadequate number of latrines, limited accessibility to latrines, lack of constant water supply in latrines and lack of latrine maintenance by school management. Programs promoting latrine use for children were not conducted in either schools or communities and were not established as a preferred social norm in such settings. Children perceived existing school latrines as unappealing and expressed a wish to have basic, functional, clean, and colorful school latrines with privacy.
   Conclusions: The paper shows that the current school based sanitation promotion is insufficient to change sanitation behavior of school children irrespective of their ethnicity. It is important that schools, households and communities work more closely together to increase use and uptake of latrine use among schoolchildren. Also, the contractors of latrine facilities must work more closely with local school management when constructing latrines, including identifying location, design and appropriate systems of water supply. A separate budget needs to be allocated to allow the school to maintain the sanitation infrastructure and keep it hygienic and appealing for users.

TI  - Health Insurance Coverage and Impact: A Survey in Three Cities in China
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background: China has one of the world's largest health insurance systems, composed of government-run basic health insurance and commercial health insurance. The basic health insurance has undergone system-wide reform in recent years. Meanwhile, there is also significant development in the commercial health insurance sector. A phone call survey was conducted in three major cities in China in July and August, 2011. The goal was to provide an updated description of the effect of health insurance on the population covered. Of special interest were insurance coverage, gross and out-of-pocket medical cost and coping strategies.
   Results: Records on 5,097 households were collected. Analysis showed that smaller households, higher income, lower expense, presence of at least one inpatient treatment and living in rural areas were significantly associated with a lower overall coverage rate. In the separate analysis of basic and commercial health insurance, similar factors were found to have significant associations. Higher income, presence of chronic disease, presence of inpatient treatment, higher coverage rates and living in urban areas were significantly associated with higher gross medical cost. A similar set of factors were significantly associated with higher out-of-pocket cost. Households with lower income, inpatient treatment, higher commercial insurance coverage, and living in rural areas were significantly more likely to pursue coping strategies other than salary.
   Conclusions: The surveyed cities and surrounding rural areas had socioeconomic status far above China's average. However, there was still a need to further improve coverage. Even for households with coverage, there was considerable out-of-pocket medical cost, particularly for households with inpatient treatments and/or chronic diseases. A small percentage of households were unable to self-finance out-of-pocket medical cost. Such observations suggest possible targets for further improving the health insurance system.

TI  - IMPACT EVALUATION OF INDIA'S 'YESHASVINI' COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMME
T2  - HEALTH ECONOMICS
AB  - Using propensity score matching techniques, the study evaluates the impact of India's Yeshasvini community-based health insurance programme on health-care utilisation, financial protection, treatment outcomes and economic well-being. The programme offers free out-patient diagnosis and lab tests at discounted rates when ill, but, more importantly, it covers highly catastrophic and less discretionary in-patient surgical procedures. For its impact evaluation, 4109 randomly selected households in villages in rural Karnataka, an Indian state, were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. A comprehensive set of indicators was developed and the quality of matching was tested. Generally, the programme is found to have increased utilisation of health-care services, reduced out-of-pocket spending, and ensured better health and economic outcomes. More specifically, however, these effects vary across socio-economic groups and medical episodes. The programme operates by bringing the direct price of health-care down but the extent to which this effectively occurs across medical episodes is an empirical issue. Further, the effects are more pronounced for the better-off households. The article demonstrates that community insurance presents a workable model for providing high-end services in resource-poor settings through an emphasis on accountability and local management.

TI  - How Significant Are the Roles Moral Obligation and Formal Institutions Play in Participatory Irrigation Management?
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Against the background of the agricultural tax reform and the disintegration of China's rural collective agriculture system, participatory irrigation management (PIM) is the key to improving irrigation management performance. Based on the survey data of 712 peasant households in the Yellow River basin of China, this study employs multi-group structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore the impact of moral obligation and formal institutions on PIM. The results show that both moral obligation and formal institutions can significantly improve collective action. Collective action can markedly promote irrigation management performance, and the formal institution can significantly enhance the farmers' moral obligation. Additionally, the results of the multi-group analysis show that the agricultural income level of households and their provinces can regulate the impact of moral obligation and formal institutions on PIM. Therefore, to improve irrigation management performance, strategies of intensifying moral obligation and refining formal institutions are recommended for governments and village committees.

TI  - Delivering the Goods: Fair Trade, Solidarity, and the Moral Economy of the Coffee Contract in Nicaragua
T2  - HUMAN ORGANIZATION
AB  - This paper explores a deceptively simple question: why do peasant farmers participate in Fair Trade coffee networks? Campaigns touting Fair Trade often suggest that farmers are incentivized to participate due to price premiums and social development benefits. However, a growing literature documenting development outcomes in coffee farming communities suggests that farmers do not reap the benefits of Fair Trade in the way they are presented in the global North. I draw upon ethnographic research in a community that is one the earliest suppliers of Fair Trade in Nicaragua. Combining participant observation, political economic analysis, and oral history interviews, I explore a conflict over out-of-network coffee sales in 2005 that threatened to undermine supplies of high quality coffee critical to the growth of the producer organization and by extension the Fair Trade network. The conflict and its aftermath reveal place-based moral economic entanglements between farmers and producer organizations in Nicaragua that shape whether farmers deliver the goods. I argue that farmers participate in Fair Trade networks in spite of low household incomes and cycles of indebtedness because of the ability of the producer organization to maintain a sense of solidarity linking coffee contracts to a longer agrarian struggle.

TI  - The Impact of Land Privatization on Cooperation in Farm Labor in Kenya
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
AB  - Establishing private property in land through registration and titling has been promoted in developing countries due to the anticipated benefits of private ownership in access to credit, productivity enhancing investments, and productivity gains. Evidence of such benefits is limited, however. In this paper, we examine a related question: What is the impact of privatization on cooperation in farm labor? Data collected in 2005 from Samburu District in Kenya is analyzed, comparing one community where land has been privatized to a second where land is communally held in a group ranch. It is hypothesized that households with title deeds are less likely to cooperate in farm labor than households without deeds. The hypothesis was confirmed, as the odds of cooperating in communal farm labor are 93.0% lower for households with deeds compared to those without. This effect has negative implications for collective action efforts in Siambu.

TI  - Efficient Responses to Targeted Cash Transfers
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB  - We estimate and test the restrictions of a collective model of household consumption, using z-conditional demands, in the context of a large conditional cash transfer program in rural Mexico. The model can explain the impacts of the program on the structure of food consumption. We use two plausible and novel distribution factors: the random allocation of a cash transfer to women and the relative size and wealth of the husband''s and wife''s family networks. Our structure does better at predicting the effect of exogenous increases in household income than an alternative, unitary, structure. We cannot reject efficiency of household decisions.

TI  - Spillovers of Community-Based Health Interventions on Consumption Smoothing
T2  - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE
AB  - Community-based group interventions are a cost-effective way of delivering programs in low-income settings. Design features may influence behaviors beyond those targeted by the intervention. This paper studies spillover effects of a participatory community health intervention in rural Malawi, implemented through a cluster randomized control trial, on an untargeted outcome: consumption smoothing after crop losses. While crop losses reduce consumption growth in the absence of the intervention, households in treated areas compensate for this loss and perfectly insure their consumption. We rule out better self-insurance and labor supply adjustments as drivers, indicating that informal risk sharing must have improved. Suggestive evidence shows that health improvements cannot explain the whole effect and that instead social interactions, which may have alleviated contracting frictions, had a role to play.

TI  - Subsidies and distortions in China's agriculture: evidence from producer-level data
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - Concerned about national grain self-sufficiency and rural household incomes, in 2004 China announced that it was planning to reverse its longstanding policy of taxing farm households and instead began to provide them with subsidies. Over the past five years, annual announcements have trumpeted rises in subsidies. Surprisingly, despite the historic turnaround of policy and the likely implication of this subsidy policy to China's grain economy, there has been no household-level survey-based research that has sought to understand the effect of China's subsidy programme on household behaviour. Using data from a national survey of more than 1000 households, we examine in detail a number of different dimensions of the subsidy programme. According to the survey-based findings, we have shown that although agricultural subsidies per farm are low, on per unit of cultivated area basis or total amount of budget, the subsidies are high. Almost all producers are receiving them. Subsidies are mostly being given to the land contractor, not the tiller. Most importantly, the subsidies appear to be nondistorting. No matter if we look at descriptive statistics in tables, scatter plots or regression analyses, there is no evidence that grain subsidies are distorting producer decisions in terms of grain area or input use decisions.

TI  - Gender-Specific Livelihood Strategies for Coping with Climate Change-Induced Food Insecurity in Southeast Nigeria
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - This study assessed the livelihood strategies adopted by husbands and wives within the same households for coping with climate-induced food insecurity in Southeast Nigeria. Collective and bargaining approaches were used in collecting individual and intra-household-level data of 120 pairs of spouses in Southeast Nigeria; husbands and wives were interviewed separately. Focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and household surveys were used to elicit responses from the respondents. Quantitative data for the study were analyzed using percentage, mean scores, and multinomial logit regression analysis. Results of the study revealed that 90% of the wives were more food insecure than their husbands (79.2%). The respondents noted that the observed changes in the climate contributed immensely to their food insecurity situation. To cope with food insecurity, a slightly higher proportion (47.3% and 14.2%) of wives adopted on-farm and non-farm strategies, respectively, while men (39.8%) adopted more off-farm strategies (38.5%). Additionally, results of the multinomial logit regression revealed that market distance and credit access significantly influenced the choice of husbands' and wives' engagement in off-farm livelihood strategy; sourcing information on climate change issues significantly influenced women's choice of engagement in off-farm/non-farm strategy; and receiving remittances significantly influenced men's choice of engagement in non-farm strategy. The study concluded that, although women play crucial roles in addressing food insecurity within their households, gender-specific obstacles typically impede their abilities to cope with climate-induced food insecurity.

TI  - Mitigating the impacts of fragmented land tenure through community-based institutional innovations: two case study villages from Guinan County of Qinghai Province, China
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - The privatization of collectively used rangelands results in fragmentation of land use in pastoral areas. This affects pastoralists' grazing strategies and results in new institutional arrangements for addressing changing social-ecological systems. Two main systems of grazing management have emerged in the pastoral regions of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau that offer new perspectives on addressing rangeland fragmentation. One allows the renting of parcels of allocated grazing land to or from others (RTS) and is based on having fenced contracted parcels for each household. The other is a community-based grazing quota system (GQS) in which a grazing use quota is allocated to each household, while the community maintains collective use of the rangeland. We compare two case study villages implementing these two different management systems, operating across household and community scales, and analyze vegetation composition, above-ground biomass, and soil properties as indicators of impacts. Transects reveal that above-ground biomass was higher under the RTS than under the GQS, but species composition shifted to dominance by non-palatable forbs and graminoids. The RTS grasslands had lower carbon and nitrogen density compared to GQS-managed grasslands. These differences are consistent with the herder's perceptions of ecological changes. The general improvement of rangeland conditions under the GQS may be linked to greater herd mobility and the control of livestock numbers through the establishment of community-enforced grazing quotas. Mobility under the RTS is limited to a few parcels, and local regulation of stocking rates is minimal because the system relies on external intervention. The case of GQS suggests that addressing rangeland fragmentation with improved vegetation conditions requires institutions operating at both household and community scales allowing for mobility and regulation of stocking rates.

TI  - Balancing the funds in the New Cooperative Medical Scheme in rural China: determinants and influencing factors in two provinces
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - In recent years, the central government in China has been leading the re-establishment of its rural health insurance system, but local government institutions have considerable flexibility in the specific design and management of schemes. Maintaining a reasonable balance of funds is critical to ensure that the schemes are sustainable and effective in offering financial protection to members. This paper explores the financial management of the NCMS in China through a case study of the balance of funds and the factors influencing this, in six counties in two Chinese provinces. The main data source is NCMS management data from each county from 2003 to 2005, supplemented by: a household questionnaire survey, qualitative interviews and focus group discussions with all local stakeholders and policy document analysis. The study found that five out of six counties held a large fund surplus, whilst enrolees obtained only partial financial protection. However, in one county greater risk pooling for enrolees was accompanied by relatively high utilisation levels, resulting in a fund deficit. The opportunities to sustainably increase the financial protection offered to NCMS enrolees are limited by the financial pressures on local government, specific political incentives and low technical capacities at the county level and below. Our analysis suggests that in the short term, efforts should be made to improve the management of the current NCMS design, which should be supported through capacity building for NCMS offices. However, further medium-term initiatives may be required including changes to the design of the schemes. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Cereal production practices and technical efficiency among farm households in major "teff" growing mixed farming areas of Ethiopia: A stochastic meta-frontier approach
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This study examined the effects of research-based recommended cereal production practices on the technical efficiency of farm households based on household-level data generated from questionnaire surveys, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. The technical efficiency scores were estimated using the stochastic meta-frontier approach because it allows addressing the expected differences in production technologies. Tobit regression framework was applied to identify factors related to farm inefficiency. Results showed mean technical efficiency of 58%, implying that the farm households can improve cereal output by about 36% with the current level of input mix and technologies. The t-test results revealed farm households who adopted high-yielding varieties with research-based recommended production practices were technically more efficient than their counterparts. Our econometric model results also indicated that the use of high-yielding varieties and research-based recommended seed rate affects the technical efficiency of farm households positively and significantly. In addition, we find gender, age, mobile telephone ownership, cooperative membership, access to input market, and crop damage as significant factors affecting the efficiency of farm households. Our findings highlight the importance of addressing technology adoption gaps and gender-based disparities, expanding access to information and modern inputs, strengthening social capital, and adopting climate change adaptation practices to improve the efficiency of farm households.

TI  - Investigating the Inclusive-Performance tradeoff in agricultural Cooperatives: Evidence from Nepal
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Is there a tradeoff between inclusive membership and market performance in agricultural cooperatives? Prior studies argue that inclusive membership practices damage cooperative performance by increasing internal transaction and coordination costs. Determining the extent of this tradeoff is essential to under-standing the role that cooperatives play in alleviating poverty. Previous studies have largely overlooked the extent to which organizational activities are inclusive of existing members. We expand the definition of inclusive membership to account for extensive as well as intensive inclusion, where the former describes the diversity of a cooperative's membership and the latter refers to including existing members in group activities. We examine the inclusive-performance tradeoff with respect to both dimensions of inclusion. Our results suggest that extensive inclusion is associated with lower market performance, while intensive inclusion is associated with higher market performance. This indicates that both exten-sive and intensive inclusion have a meaningful, but opposite, association with a cooperative's ability to achieve market performance. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Attitude, knowledge and perception of choice of cooking fuels: Evidence from two large communities in South-east Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB  - There has been reported low adoption of cleaner cooking fuel technologies and systems in Nigeria. The literature documents that socio-economic, cultural/behavioral, and environmental factors influence the decision to adopt alternative cooking fuels. However, there is a dearth of evidence on the most important factors influencing transition to clean cooking fuels in South-east Nigeria. This study therefore analyzed the knowledge, attitude, behavior and practice of rural households' with regards to transition to cleaner cooking fuels particularly liquified petroleum gas (LPG). The study also analyzed the socio-economic determinants of the transition to LPG in southeast Nigeria. Two communities in southeast Nigeria that benefitted from the Modern Energy Cooking Services (MECS) project funded by UKAID (DFID) participated in the study. We administered questionnaire to 407 household heads randomly selected from the two communities. This study used descriptive statistics, Likert scale analysis and binary probit model to analyze the data collected. The results show that while LPG was the most (51.84%) preferred choice of cooking fuel, only 0.74% of the households in practice actually used LPG for cooking. The main reason for the very low use of LPG was high cost of LPG and its accessories. The study also revealed that gender, education, household size, membership of cooperative societies, were the significant predictors of clean cooking transition. Therefore, policies and programs should be designed to increase women's access to quality education and encourage them to organize themselves in cooperatives to enhance their access to LPG.

TI  - Business 'Power of Presence': Foreign Capital, Industry Practices, and Politics of Sustainable Development in Zambian Agriculture
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - Sustainable Development Goals have brought optimism around 'agriculture for development' but also questioned agribusinesses in sustainable development. This paper assesses how an agribusiness' power exploits domains to exert control over industry governance. Using interviews and group discussions from three smallholder outgrower schemes under Illovo Sugar Plc in Zambia, the paper demonstrates that corporations can deploy the 'power of presence' to influence national policy development, and sustainability in regional and local practices. Investment and trade policies currently foster agribusinesses but overlook environmental assessments that expose social and ecological contradictions such as on competing water uses. State-donor relations enable smallholder integration in sugarcane as poverty reduction whilst agribusinesses are limiting their participation through controls on resources and production systems. By analysing power expressions, we show how possibilities of sustainable agriculture and rural development are undermined by agribusiness practices. We suggest that current policy efforts around 'agriculture for development' in Zambia are about entrenching power and interests of an agribusiness, neglecting industry expansion and sustainability. The paper highlights the limits and importance of domestic institutions in framing large-scale agricultural investments as well as mediating corporate practices that will be required to provide a greater focus on national planning processes for sustainable agriculture and rural development.

TI  - Speed of adoption of intensive agricultural practices in Rwanda: A duration analysis
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - Maize is one of the main staple food crops grown in Rwanda that forms a significant part of household consumption. However, maize yields in Rwanda have remained low due to the limited adoption of fertilisers and improved seed varieties. This study aims to analyse factors that influence the timing of adoption of fertilisers and improved seed varieties (i.e., intensive agricultural practices) in Rwanda. The duration analysis approach is applied, providing a statistical method that permits the timing of the adoption event to be explicitly modelled in a dynamic framework. The results highlight the importance of social learning and information acquisition through extension services, media, and a network of fellow farmers in increasing adoption rates for fertilisers and improved maize varieties. Similarly, membership in farmers' associations, access to credit, and risk-loving behaviour positively affect the speed of adoption. Policy insights from the study suggest that strategies for promoting faster adoption should focus on providing information through agricultural extension services, media, and a network of fellow farmers. Additionally, farmers' cooperatives should be given priority as a dissemination pathway that can increase adoption speed for fertilisers and improved maize varieties.

TI  - Analysis of the Impact of Rural Households' Behaviors on Heavy Metal Pollution of Arable Soil: Taking Lankao County as an Example
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - As heavy metal pollution of arable soil is a significant issue concerning the quality of agricultural products and human health, the rural households' behaviors have a direct impact on heavy metal content in arable soil and its pollution level, but only a few researches have been done at such microscopic scale. Based on 101 field questionnaires of rural households in Lankao County and the monitoring data on heavy metal of arable soil of each rural household, the kind of rural households' behaviors which impose obvious influence on heavy metal content of arable soil are investigated via single-factor pollution index, Nemerow pollution index and econometric model in this study. The results show that, rural households' land utilization mode affects heavy metal content in soil, e.g., the degree of heavy metal pollution of soil for intensive planting is higher than that of traditional planting, viz. vegetable greenhouse > garlic land > traditional crop farmland. The management of cultivated land with due scale is beneficial to reducing heavy metal content in soil, that is, the land fragmentation degree is in direct proportion to heavy metal content in soil, so rural households are encouraged to carry out land circulation and combine the patch into a large one. Excess application of fertilizer, pesticide and organic fertilizer will lead to heavy metal pollution of soil, while agricultural technical training organized by government department and the foundation of agricultural cooperative can promote the technical level and degree of organization of rural households and enable them to be more scientific and rational in agrochemicals selection and application, hence reducing or avoiding heavy metal pollution of soil. Single factor pollution level of heavy metal in the soil for planting various crops is different, so it is recommended to prepare various pollution reduction programs for different land types and pollution levels for the harmony and unity of human-nature system.

TI  - Perceptions, Problems and Prospects of Contract Farming: Insights from Rice Production in Vietnam
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Contract farming (CF) is considered a relevant measure to tackle the challenges to sustainable development from the serious effects of climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the positive effects of CF, low participation and frequent breaching of contracts remain challenges. Several studies have mentioned the advantages and disadvantages of CF but little is known about their rankings and perceptions of CF from the involved stakeholders. To address these evidence gaps, this study surveys stakeholders, ranks the perceived advantages and disadvantages of CF, and investigates the problems and prospects of CF. The study utilizes data triangulation from three stakeholders: farmers, contractors, and government policymakers. Data include twenty-seven key informant interviews (KIIs), seven focus group discussions (FGDs), and two participant observations (POs). Data are analyzed by a mixed method approach with methods of constant comparison, content analysis, and Rank Based Quotient (RBQ). The results indicate that while the main perceived advantage of CF relates to the outputs, the top three disadvantages of CF relate to issues likely to cause a breach of contract. The results also reveal that there seems to be a difference in the perception of CF's advantages and disadvantages among the stakeholders. Despite the problems such as breaching several contract terms, mistrust, or market manipulation from the local collectors, CF in Vietnam is overall promising.

TI  - Correlation Between New Cooperative Medical Scheme Policy Design and Catastrophic Medical Payment: Evidence From 25 Counties in Rural China
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Few studies have examined the association between the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) policy design and its achievement of providing financial protection to rural residents. This study collected data on NCMS policy design and health care spending from 25 counties and rural households in their catchment areas. It shows that on average, NCMS has a growing but small effect on the reduction of catastrophic medical payment (CMP) incidence. If outpatient spending can be reimbursed from an NCMS pooled account, the incidence of CMP before a reimbursement and that after a reimbursement will be reduced. Higher nominal reimbursement rate for inpatient spending at provincial hospitals is correlated with higher incidence of CMP before a reimbursement. Higher ceiling for annual reimbursement from NCMS is associated with lower incidence of CMP after a reimbursement. Thus, NCMS policy design can be improved to strengthen its effects on the reduction of CMP incidence.

TI  - What limits the utilization of health services among the rural population in the Dabie Mountains-Evidence from Hubei province, China?
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Individuals living in rural mountain areas tend to use health services less to manage discomfort or illness. This study aims to identify the variables that best explain the health service utilization of a sample of the rural population in the Dabie Mountains in China.
   Methods: To obtain information about health service utilization, a cross-sectional household survey was conducted using face-to-face interviews among the residents of a poor town in the Dabie Mountains. A total of 1,003 residents aged 15 or more, who had felt unwell in the last two weeks before the survey, were included in the analysis. The.2 test and binary logistic regression were used to analyze the factors influencing health service utilization.
   Results: A total of 51.2% of those surveyed had not used health services when they felt unwell, higher than the data reported in the 4th National Health Services Survey of China. Enabling variables played an important role in predicting the utilization of health services. Factors associated with increased health service utilization included being younger, travelling longer to the nearest clinic, and higher household net income.
   Conclusion: To reduce disparities in health service utilization, (1) some effort should be made to change the perceptions and attitudes of older people; (2) reimbursement levels of the New Rural Cooperative Medical Care System should be improved to reduce economic barriers to health service utilization.

TI  - Farmer Cooperatives and the Limits of Agricultural Reform in Rural Hubei
T2  - CHINA JOURNAL
AB  - There has been remarkable growth in the number of cooperatives in China in the past decade. This article asks: what role are cooperatives playing in driving China's ambitious agricultural reforms? The scholarly literature describes farmer cooperatives as either an important entity for progressing China's rural modernization agenda, a vehicle of exploitation and dispossession of smallholder farmers, or evidence of broader commitment to grassroots solidarity. Despite the rapid expansion of farmer cooperatives, the role that they play in the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in places where agriculture remains central and out-migration is low is poorly understood. To explore this, in 2019 we conducted a survey of 266 households in the mountains of Hubei Province. To illuminate the politics and dynamics on the ground, we followed up by conducting in-depth interviews with agribusinesses, cooperatives, households, and local government officials. Our findings suggest that although cooperatives are attempting to engage with smallholders, they are neither integrating nor exploiting them. While seemingly innocuous to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, these entities serve a mostly political function, and it is in these dynamics that we observe the limits of agricultural reform. Where smallholder production is lucrative, land is valuable, and out-migration is minimal, local government appears to be "performing" reform, without forcing it on smallholders and thereby harming the local economy or risking social unrest.

TI  - Resource scarcity and cooperation: Evidence from a gravity irrigation system in China
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Resource scarcity has become an increasingly pressing challenge to the world. How scarcity affects people's preferences and behavior has been taken as an important issue for development. This study examines the impact of long-term exposure to resource scarcity on farmers' cooperation. Specifically, we focus on water scarcity in irrigation agriculture, and examine the effect of water scarcity on cooperation in the context of a gravity irrigation system in western China. A historical irrigation water quota system provides an opportunity to measure exogenous variations of water scarcity within an otherwise homogeneous region. We use the ratio of the arable land area to the irrigation water quota of each village as our measure of water scarcity. Moreover, we use the contributions in a public goods game to measure the farmers' willingness to cooperate. Combining a household survey and a lab-in-the-field experiment with 312 rural residents in northwestern China, we find that irrigation water scarcity significantly increases farmers' willingness to cooperate. The results are robust to potential endogeneity concerns and many confounding factors. We also find that water scarcity is positively correlated with irrigation management activities and canal conditions. Our findings provide important policy implications for common pool resource management and collective actions in rural communities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Does Internet use improve technical efficiency? Evidence from apple production in China
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - This study aims to investigate the impact of Internet use on technical efficiency in apple production in China using a unique cross-sectional dataset covering 479 apple-producing farm households. The stochastic frontier analysis is used to calculate technical efficiency in apple production, accounting for the endogenous issues of intermediate inputs. The endogenous switching regression model is employed to examine the impact of Internet use on technical efficiency, accounting for the self-selectivity bias arising from observable and unobservable factors. The survey reveals that 52.4% of the sample farm households use the Internet to acquire technological information. On average, technical efficiency in apple production for the sample farm households merely equals 0.63, indicating substantial room for further improvement. After accounting for the self-selectivity bias, the Internet users would reduce technical efficiency by 30.3% if they had not used the Internet to acquire technological information. The robustness check using the treatment effects model reconfirms that Internet use can improve technical efficiency in apple production. Policy implications for developing an Internet-based agricultural extension system in China are also discussed.

TI  - Predictors of maternal health services utilization by poor, rural women: a comparative study in Indian States of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH POPULATION AND NUTRITION
AB  - Background: India leads all nations in numbers of maternal deaths, with poor, rural women contributing disproportionately to the high maternal mortality ratio. In 2005, India launched the world's largest conditional cash transfer scheme, Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), to increase poor women's access to institutional delivery, anticipating that facility-based birthing would decrease deaths. Indian states have taken different approaches to implementing JSY. Tamil Nadu adopted JSY with a reorganization of its public health system, and Gujarat augmented JSY with the state-funded Chiranjeevi Yojana (CY) scheme, contracting with private physicians for delivery services. Given scarce evidence of the outcomes of these approaches, especially in states with more optimal health indicators, this cross-sectional study examined the role of JSY/CY and other healthcare system and social factors in predicting poor, rural women's use of maternal health services in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.
   Methods: Using the District Level Household Survey (DLHS)-3, the sample included 1584 Gujarati and 601 Tamil rural women in the lowest two wealth quintiles. Multivariate logistic regression analyses examined associations between JSY/CY and other salient health system, socio-demographic, and obstetric factors with three outcomes: adequate antenatal care, institutional delivery, and Cesarean-section.
   Results: Tamil women reported greater use of maternal healthcare services than Gujarati women. JSY/CY participation predicted institutional delivery in Gujarat (AOR = 3.9), but JSY assistance failed to predict institutional delivery in Tamil Nadu, where mothers received some cash for home births under another scheme. JSY/CY assistance failed to predict adequate antenatal care, which was not incentivized. All-weather road access predicted institutional delivery in both Tamil Nadu (AOR = 3.4) and Gujarat (AOR = 1.4). Women's education predicted institutional delivery and Cesarean-section in Tamil Nadu, while husbands' education predicted institutional delivery in Gujarat.
   Conclusions: Overall, assistance from health financing schemes, good road access to health facilities, and socio-demographic and obstetric factors were associated with differential use of maternity health services by poor, rural women in the two states. Policymakers and practitioners should promote financing schemes to increase access, including consideration of incentives for antenatal care, and address health system and social factors in designing state-level interventions to promote safe motherhood.

TI  - Adaptation, coping strategies and resilience of agricultural drought in South Africa: implication for the sustainability of livestock sector
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Agricultural drought has put sub-Saharan African under significant pressure, and without adaptation, will negatively influence a future generation. Hence, it is crucial to assess the adaptation and coping strategies, the resilience of agricultural drought, its implication on the sustainability of the livestock sector, and developing future interventions. Data of 217 smallholder livestock farmers were used in a principal component analysis to estimate the agricultural drought resilience index as an outcome variable against social wellbeing, economic outcome, environmental variable and adaptive capacity variables. The results found that 21% of the livestock farming households sold their livestock as an adaptation and coping strategy. In contrast, 20% of the farming households used alternative land use as an adaptation, and coping strategy, 20% stored food, 17% asked for animal feed, 6% sought employment, 6% migrated, 5% kept drought-tolerant breeds, 3% received relief grants, 2% used their savings and investments, and 1% leased their farms. When natural, economic and social sustain ability was viewed as a resilience process, the three pillars positively and significantly impacted households' agricultural drought resilience. This implied that the more smallholder farmers participated in social networks and cooperatives, the higher the resilience to agricultural drought. Further, the more resources, income, access to land, access to water, access to credit, and additional types of farming, the higher the households' resilience to agricultural drought and adaptive capacity. Thus, the three pillars of sustainability are crucial for enhancing the resilience and adaptability of smallholder livestock farmers. The study recommends that government aid reduce vulnerability to agricultural drought via access to agricultural credit and encourage farmers to be part of social networks and cooperatives. Additionally, the government could improve access to land and water rights to boost the resilience of smallholder farmers to agricultural drought. This could be achieved through collaboration and coordination among all role players.

TI  - The Role of Foreign Direct Investment and Food Processing Industry toward High Value Agriculture in Asia - Cross Country Statistical Analysis and Farm Level Evidence
T2  - JARQ-JAPAN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY
AB  - In many Asian countries, agricultural industrialization led by agro-industries has been progressing, and agricultural production has been shifting from staple foods to high value commodities such as vegetables, fruits and livestock products. This trend is considered to have contributed to improving agricultural profitability as well as to expanding rural employment. The purpose of the paper is to test the hypothesis that the foreign direct investment (FDI) promotes high value agriculture through development of the food processing industry. We estimated factors that determine labor productivity in the food processing industry and agricultural sector, and obtained cross country statistical results that provide supports to the hypothesis. The typical case of this FDI-food industry-farm linkage is seen in contract fanning, in which firms provide technical assistances and guaranteed markets to farmers. The results Of a farm household Survey implemented in China by the authors provide the farm level evidence to the linkage, in which foreign affiliated enterprises play important roles in technology transfer in compliance with food safety standards.

TI  - Governing livelihood and land use transitions: The role of customary tenure in southeastern Morocco
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - This article documents how customary land tenure systems mediate transformations of land use and livelihoods in the arid pre-Saharan region of southeast Morocco. Although dominant development paradigms for land governance have begun to recognize customary regimes, development orthodoxy still holds that formalizing rules as part of national property law is essential to ensuring economic growth or effectively governing land use and livelihood transformations. Our research in southeastern Morocco indicates that customary tenure regimes play a central role in managing such transformations in the absence of effective formal property frameworks. Extended ethnographic fieldwork in the Mgoun Valley of Tinghir province established the trajectory of rural livelihoods, migration, and land use in the latter half of the 20th Century. Additionally, the authors conducted a survey with 306 households in the Mgoun Valley, documenting income, asset, and livelihood profiles of households today; the survey produced demographic, livelihood, and asset profiles of these same households in the early 1960 s. The results confirm a marked shift from pastoralism to other land uses and livelihoods at the household level in the last half-century. The household-level data also show how the "invisible rules" embedded in customary tenure regimes shape livelihood and land use options available to different households. Unformalized tenure rights in collectively-owned land and breakdowns in customary resource management regimes under global economic pressures are often seen-in Morocco and other parts of the world-as producing chaotic or unsustainable land use change. However, this research shows that customary land tenure may, in fact, actively manage such change using rules that may be invisible to formal data collection and policy-making institutions, but are not invisible to the people negotiating these dynamic rule systems.

TI  - Does the universal medical insurance system reduce catastrophic health expenditure among middle-aged and elderly households in China? A longitudinal analysis
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS
AB  - Background The Chinese government has made great progress in establishing the universal medical insurance system. This study aimed to analyze whether the universal medical insurance system protected middle-aged and elderly households from catastrophic health expenditure (CHE). Methods The data were obtained from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. We used household as our unit of analysis and CHE was measured as out-of-pocket expenditures >= 40% of nonfood household expenditures. Univariate analysis was deployed to examine the impacts of different medical insurance schemes on CHE, and the factors associated with CHE were estimated using a random-effects logit regression model. Results We identified 10,005, 10,370, and 11,567 households in 2011, 2013, and 2015, respectively, and found 12.9% (2011), 26.6% (2013) and 27.9% (2015) of the households experienced CHE. When compared with no insurance, households enrolled in New Rural Cooperative Medical Insurance Scheme (P = 0.023) were associated with a lower incidence of CHE, but other insurance schemes were not significant. Households with members older than 65 years (P < 0.001), members with chronic diseases (P < 0.001), members with poor self-reported health conditions (P < 0.001), and members receiving health care (P < 0.001) had a higher risk of CHE. Large household size (P < 0.001) and high household income per capita (P < 0.001) were major protective factors to CHE incidence. Conclusions Despite China's great stride in the medical insurance coverage, it fell short to provide financial protection against medical expenditure burden. To reduce the risk of CHE, an integrated poverty and elderly-oriented medical insurance system could be put in place to address these problems.

TI  - Insurance of Household Risks and the Rebalancing of the Chinese Economy: Health Insurance, Health Expenses and Household Savings
T2  - PACIFIC ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - This paper studies the effects of a public insurance system, the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) on household savings in rural China. We develop a theoretical model in which we explain the impact of health insurance on savings through the impact of health insurance on out-of-pocket (OOP) health expense given the household level of wealth and seriousness of illness. We test the model empirically using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey. We run endogenous and exogenous quantile regressions to evaluate the effects of NCMS participation on the distributions of household savings and OOP health expense. The impact of NCMS varies with the seriousness of illness. The NCMS induces an increase in OOP health expense for mild illness and, inversely, a decrease in health payments for more serious illnesses. The NCMS also leads to a higher incidence of catastrophic healthcare spending. The impact of the NCMS, given a certain state of illness, also varies with the household level of wealth. Poor households face health expense for both mild and serious illnesses. As the NCMS has opposite effects on the OOP expense for these two kinds of illness, we observe no effect on poor households' precautionary savings. Because the decrease in OOP health expense for mild illness is larger for less poor households, the NCMS induces a decrease in their savings. For the most affluent households, the higher decrease in OOP spending on most moderate illness is dominated by a sharp increase in catastrophic expense, causing an increase in savings. To significantly reduce household savings and enhance household consumption, the NCMS has to offer better coverage against both serious and catastrophic health risks.

TI  - Labor-saving technologies in Manantali, Mali
T2  - ECONOMIC ANTHROPOLOGY
AB  - Facing enduring labor shortages, West Africans have long adopted labor-saving technologies. Using data from a study of 108 households in 2016-18 in Manantali, Mali, this article looks at the availability, adoption, uses, and outcomes of common labor-saving technologies in agriculture, domestic provision, transport, and telecommunications. People were attracted by technologies that they deemed useful. Locally available and relatively inexpensive technologies were more readily adopted than more expensive devices that required sophisticated management. The adoption of labor-saving devices in one sphere of activity often had spillover effects into others. For example, the use of labor-saving devices in food preparation allowed women to spend more time in agriculture. In turn, greater production gave women more produce to sell and more income to address personal and collective needs. The adoption of labor-saving devices led to only incremental changes in global and local hierarchies, in part because people adopted many technologies so that they could maintain aspects of their life in changing circumstances. Although industrially produced goods mostly came from outside Mali, many locals learned to repair imported technologies, and some spare parts were locally made. As women demonstrated their ability to use greater resources to make village-wide contributions, local hierarchies of gender have been attenuated.

TI  - A bitter pill: smallholder responses to the new green revolution prescriptions in northern Ghana
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB  - Through a qualitative case study from the Northern Region of Ghana, this paper examines smallholders' perceptions of environmental change and contemporary Green Revolution prescriptions promoted by foreign donors, NGOs and the state. These prescriptions seek to commercialise and intensify production in Ghana through increasing use of chemical fertilisers, pesticides and faster-growing seed varieties. We argue that many smallholders are reluctantly adopting the inputs and techniques of the Green Revolution in response to erratic rainfall, shortened growing seasons, and drier soils with diminished fertility, as well as other structural constraints such as increasing competition for land. Farmers' responses are also influenced by social inequalities, as gender and wealth differences affect access to agro-inputs and participation in farm contracts. Female farmers are especially disadvantaged in adoption, which is serving to widen disparities. However, even those farmers who are following the Green Revolution prescriptions are not uncritical of its impacts, as they commonly described their decision to adhere to this technical package as a short-term trade-off to meet subsistence needs at the expense of worsening soil health and increasing debt.

TI  - Drought Adaptation in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China: Actions, Planning, Pathways and Barriers
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NX region) of Northwestern China is threatened by increased meteorological drought induced by climate change (CC) and constraints on water supply from the Yellow River. Thus, the NX region is representative of attempts to adapt to CC and variability in China's arid regions. Field visits, a questionnaire and in situ inspections were conducted in 2012-2014 to understand people's perception and awareness of drought and its impact, particularly with respect to adaptation strategies. We mainly focused on drought adaptation actions and planning implemented at the government level under the double pressures of drought and allocation. We described a suitable adaptation pathway for socio-economic sustainable development and discussed existing adaptation barriers. Construction of modern efficient water-saving agriculture lies at the core of drought adaptation, with socio-economic sustainable development being the ultimate goal. To achieve this, policies and institutional, engineering, technological, structural and social initiatives and measures-classified into macro adaptation strategies and specific coping measures-are implemented. Adaptation often encounters obstacles, e.g., policy issues from household contract responsibility systems, funding difficulties of low-income farmers, traditional behavioral habits and low education and literacy levels among farmers. The adaptation pathway involves the construction of modern efficient water-saving agriculture. Agricultural water savings are then transferred to developed industries, which back-feed socio-economic sustainable development in the NX region.

TI  - Making health insurance pro-poor: evidence from a household panel in rural China
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: In 2002, China launched the largest public health insurance scheme in the world, the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS). It is intended to enable rural populations to access health care services, and to curb medical impoverishment. Whether the scheme can reach its equity goals depends on how it is used, and by whom. Our goal is to shed light on whether and how income levels affect the ability of members to reap insurance benefits.
   Methods: We exploit primary panel data consisting of a complete census (over 3500 individuals) in three villages in Puding County, Guizhou province, collected in 2004, 2006, 2009 and 2011. Data was collected during in-person interviews with household member(s). The data include yearly gross and net medical expenses for all individuals, and socio-economic information. We apply probit, ordinary least squares, and tobit multivariate regression analyses to the three waves in which NCMS was active (2006, 2009 and 2011). Explained variables include obtainment, levels and rates of NCMS reimbursement. Household income is the main explanatory variable, with household-and individual-level controls. We restrict samples to rule out self-selection, and exploit the 2009 NCMS reform to highlight equity-enhancing features of insurance.
   Results: Prior to 2009 reforms, higher income in our sample was statistically significantly related to higher probability of obtaining reimbursement, as well as higher levels and rates of reimbursement. These relations all disappear after the reform, suggesting lower-income households were better able to reap insurance benefits after the scheme was reformed. Regression results suggest this is partly explained by reimbursement for chronic diseases.
   Conclusions: The post-reform NCMS distributed benefits more equitably in our study area. Making health insurance pro-poor may require a focus on outpatient costs, credit constraints and chronic diseases, rather than catastrophic illnesses.

TI  - Effect of voluntary cooperativisation on livelihood capital of smallholder dairy farmers in the southwest of Bangladesh
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
AB  - This study investigated the effects of voluntary cooperativisationas conducted by the Community-Based Dairy Veterinary Foundation (CDVF) on the livelihood capital of smallholder dairy farmers. An essential part of this cooperativisation was the provision of community-based paid extension service to the farmers by the cooperative. The sustainable livelihood approach was used to analyse livelihood capital. A simple random sampling technique was used to gather data from 255 respondents: including 15key informant interviews, 5 focus group discussions and 5 case studies. Almost all of the farmers felt that the paid service was profitable. Equal portion of farmers realised moderate (49.80%) and high gains (50.20%) from CDVF. Most significant improvements occurred in physical, financial and human capital resources. CDVF has increased production, and improved farmer-to-market linkage maximised profit and income. Farmers reinvested their improved income in physical assets development. Farmers gained considerable knowledge, skill, employment, voice, intensified social networks, green homesteads and livelihood security from the CDVF services. The complementary effect of all five forms of livelihood capital strengthened the assets pentagon of the participating farmers. Regression results affirm that gender, education, distance from CDVF centre, amount of extension communication, increased milk production and higher income are the determinants of farmers' improved assets base. CDVF needs to professionalise its management and corporate strategy, and their successful voluntary cooperativisation model needs to be promoted and encouraged by all including the State.

TI  - Can Trust Motivate Farmers to Purchase Natural Disaster Insurance? Evidence from Earthquake-Stricken Areas of Sichuan, China
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Natural disasters cause great losses of property and life in many areas of China. However, rural residents do not always insure themselves against these losses. Measuring the correlation between trust and farmers' behavior related to the purchasing of natural disaster insurance is of great significance to the implementation of natural disaster insurance pilot programs and insurance systems in China. This article analyzes data from a survey of 327 households in four districts and counties of Sichuan Province, China, that were affected by the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquakes. According to the relevant theories of trust, trust was divided into three dimensions: authority trust, collective trust, and relationship trust. Then a technology acceptance model was built, and PLS-SEM was used to comprehensively analyze the correlation between different dimensions of trust and farmers' insurance purchase behavior. The results show that (1) only relationship trust was directly and significantly positively correlated with insurance purchasing behavior. Although there was no direct significant correlation between authoritative trust or collective trust and buying behavior, relationship trust was found to indirectly affect buying behavior. (2) Younger farmers and those with higher incomes are more likely to buy disaster insurance if they live in a disaster-threat zone, have experienced disasters, and are risk averse. We then discuss the correlations between farmers' trust and natural disaster insurance purchasing in areas threatened by earthquake disasters. This provides a policy inspiration for the promotion of disaster insurance and the construction of insurance systems in China.

TI  - Incentive mechanisms to exploit intraseasonal price arbitrage opportunities for smallholder farmers: Experimental evidence from Malawi
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Seasonal commodity price fluctuations can potentially offer farmers arbitrage opportunities to increase their income. However, smallholder farmers in most of sub-Saharan Africa often do not exploit these opportunities to the fullest extent possible. To inform this issue, we conducted a randomized controlled trial among 1739 smallholder farmers in Malawi to estimate the impact of two key post-harvest constraints, lack of appropriate storage technology and commitment issues, on farmers' legume storage and sales decisions. The treated groups received (i) an improved storage technology in the form of two hermetic (airtight) bags, (ii) the same improved storage technology under the condition that farmers store collectively with members of their farmer club in their village, and/or (iii) the improved storage technology under the condition that farmers store collectively at a centralized association warehouse. We analyzed the impacts of these treatments on storage behavior and revenue from sales. Results indicated that addressing the technological and commitment constraints simultaneously had the largest average impacts. One year after the intervention, farmers offered hermetic bags and the village storage program (Treatment 2) stored 24% more legumes at harvest, stored 27% longer, received a 3% higher price for their legumes and ultimately made 12% more on average than farmers in the control group. Farmers in that treatment also improved some (but not all) outcomes compared to farmers in other treatment groups. These findings suggest that combining technology with collective action that is localized and flexible can lead to better post-harvest outcomes for smallholder farmers.

TI  - Conservation agriculture, organic marketing, and collective action in the Honduran hillsides
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA) is often perceived to provide "win-win" outcomes for farmers leading to reduced erosion and off-site sedimentation, as well as improved soil fertility and productivity. However, adoption rates for CA in many regions of the world remain below expected levels. This article looks at the effects of participation in organic markets and farmers' organizations on the adoption of soil conservation practices. Based on original survey data from 241 small-scale farm households in Honduras, we find that both participation in organic markets and farmer-based groups have positive effects on the number of soil conservation practices adopted. The results indicate that besides supply-oriented policy measures, such as the provision of technical assistance and extension, demand-related factors are likely to play an important role in sustainable soil management. Demand-oriented policy measures include support for labeling initiatives and consumer education to facilitate value-added product differentiation and market segmentation.

TI  - Sugar production dynamics in Zimbabwe: an analysis of contract farming at Hippo Valley
T2  - REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB  - This article examines the nature of contractual relations between sugar outgrowers (contract farmers) and Tongaat Hulett Zimbabwe (THZ). Drawing from a research study conducted at Hippo Valley Estate, using a mixed-methods approach, findings reveal asymmetrical power relations in favour of THZ as reflected by its domination in price determination, monopsony control and risk sharing. Despite radicalisation and attempts by the state to curb the powers of international finance, the article argues that monopoly capital continues to wield significant control in Zimbabwe, leading to growing farmer indebtedness. Thus, the state-capital alliance presents a stumbling block for accumulation by sugar outgrowers.

TI  - Forest and plantation development in Laos: history, development and impact for rural communities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - This paper presents a historical review and overview of the Lao forest sector. Previous research and forestry related policy documents of Laos indicate that forest management has evolved through six stages. Initially, natural forests were used by local people for basic needs. Little was destroyed or degraded. The second stage was greatly influenced by French colonisation. The third was a period when natural forests made major contributions to national economic growth, when natural forests were increasingly and widely harvested. Remaining phases involved growing criticism of Lao forest management practices from international organisations and the Laos National Assembly. Recently, private investment in tree plantations has increased. Overall, ineffective policies and inefficient institutional agencies have seriously constrained Lao forest management. Policy instruments such as concessions to plantation development need to be modified and balanced by the promotion Of outgrower schemes. Plantation investments should be encouraged to follow international standards, guidelines and codes of practice.

TI  - Does participating in health insurance benefit the migrant workers in China? An empirical investigation
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Rural-to-urban migrant workers are an under-represented group in China's health insurance system, and the status of their health and healthcare draws increasing attention. This paper uses the 2007-2010 State Council URBMI Household Survey data to evaluate the efficacy of major health insurance programs in improving the accessibility, affordability and appropriateness of healthcare among migrant workers. Based on the instrumental variable (IV) estimation that accounts for the endogeneity of insurance participation, we find that the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) is most effective in promoting physical exams and improving self-rated health status for migrant workers, while the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS), the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) and commercial insurance show significant benefits in boosting preventive care utilization. However, the current programs are not effective in alleviating the financial burden of healthcare and promoting formal medical utilization among migrant workers, possibly due to the lack of systematic financing scheme for outpatient treatment and the segmentation between insurance platforms. Our study provides implications on reforming China's medical insurance system and migrant health policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The importance of collective and individual psychological ownership for safe sanitation: A multilevel analysis in rural Ghana
T2  - GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Unsafe sanitation practices can severely affect public health. Strengthening psychological ownership, the feeling of owning an object (e.g. the latrine) individually or collectively, may promote safe sanitation practices, e.g. decreased open defecation. This study investigated psychological ownership in communities that participated in a sanitation intervention. We used follow-up survey data of a cluster-randomised controlled trial in rural Ghana (N = 2012 households), which assessed psychological ownership, and safe sanitation outcomes. The data were analysed using multilevel modelling and generalised estimating equations. In line with our assumptions, greater psychological ownership for the latrine related to decreased open defecation. Higher individual psychological ownership for the open defecation space related to safe sanitation outcomes, whereas collective ownership related to lesser safe sanitation. The present study shows that the concept of psychological ownership may play an important role in safe sanitation. Collective and individual psychological ownership seem to distinctly relate to safe sanitation outcomes, which has high relevance for promoting communities' health behaviour.

TI  - Persistence and Change in the Rural Land System of Contemporary China
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES IN CHINA
AB  - Contemporary China's rural land institutions have gone through land reform, the cooperative movement, the People's Conunune movement and the household responsibility system. Their persistence and change can be explained through a "stickiness generation- stickiness dilution" analytical framework: institutional environment and path dependence constitute the generative inducement of institutional stickiness, and have an important role in the continuity of the rural land system; the penetration of informal institutions is a crucial variable in diluting institutional stickiness, with the interaction between informal and formal institutions running throughout the entire course of institutional change. Changes in mental concepts and ideology are important influences that strengthen, break down or build formal institutions.

TI  - Farmer satisfaction and cocoa cooperative performance: evidence from Tocache, Peru
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Cocoa marketing cooperatives are essential in the current model of governance of cocoa production and distribution in Peru and other developing countries. Because farmer satisfaction is particularly important for the success and development of cooperatives, this article focuses on an analysis of the factors related to farmer satisfaction as well as the identification of demographic and socio-economic elements that can explain the different levels of satisfaction among different cooperative members. Data obtained through a survey of 150 cocoa farmers were analyzed through three main statistical methods: (1) an exploratory factor analysis with a principal component analysis method; (2) cluster analysis; and (3) an independent samples t-test. The results confirm that farmer satisfaction is explained by a complex set of cognitive and psycho-social elements and pro-social emotions. Finally, the results indicate that some socio-economic features such as farm size or household size are associated with the varying existing levels of farmer satisfaction.

TI  - Community rotating savings and credit associations as an agent of well-being: a case study from northern Rwanda
T2  - COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL
AB  - This paper examines the potential of rotating savings and credit associations (RoSCAs) as agents of pro-poor community development and well-being in rural northern Rwanda, the area most severely disrupted during and since the civil war and genocide in the 1990s. The economic gains of membership, effects on social capital, and the inclusiveness of RoSCAs are explored. RoSCAs facilitate mobilization of a variety of resources. Members pool finances that are utilized to support the fulfilment of basic needs at the household level, in addition to building up assets. Social capital is both inherent to and stimulated by membership of a RoSCA, through the building of trust, collective actions undertaken, and the values shared by the members. RoSCAs were found to be relatively inclusive, particularly when compared with more formal credit schemes, often including representatives of the most marginalized, and therefore most vulnerable, socio-economic categories. Membership generally involves relatively small payments while contributing to positive subjective perception as well, thus fostering further human well-being. RoSCAs therefore warrant appraisal beyond the immediate financial opportunities they generate, because of their production and reproduction of values such as democracy, reciprocity, and solidarity, and thus their significant contribution to community development and human well-being.

TI  - Resolving Douglass C. North's 'puzzle' concerning China's household responsibility system
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper considers Douglass C. North's 'puzzle' concerning China's household responsibility system (HRS) and offers a possible solution. China's HRS, which has evolved over the past four decades to become its dominant form of rural land ownership, has stimulated spectacular economic growth and poverty reduction; however, it is based on a type of ownership which is far removed from the property rights regime which North regarded as essential. Two features of the HRS merit attention. The first is 'split ownership': this refers to the allocation of different aspects of ownership, including rights of access, use, management, exclusion and alienation, to a range of individual and collective actors with interests in the land in question. The second is polycentric governance: rules governing land use are derived in part from community-level action and in part from state intervention. We argue that in explaining the functioning of the HRS we need to move beyond the narrow conception of legally enforced private property rights on which North relied. We should instead embrace understandings of ownership as an emergent, diverse and complex institution, of the kind emphasized by A.M. Honore's legal theory of ownership and Elinor Ostrom's theories of the common-pool resource and polycentric governance.

TI  - New Geographies of Water and Climate Change in Peru: Coupled Natural and Social Transformations in the Santa River Watershed
T2  - ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS
AB  - Projections of future water shortages in the world's glaciated mountain ranges have grown increasingly dire. Although water modeling research has begun to examine changing environmental parameters, the inclusion of social scenarios has been very limited. Yet human water use and demand are vital for long-term adaptation, risk reduction, and resource allocation. Concerns about future water supplies are particularly pronounced on Peru's arid Pacific slope, where upstream glacier recession has been accompanied by rapid and water-intensive economic development. Models predict water shortages decades into the future, but conflicts have already arisen in Peru's Santa River watershed due to either real or perceived shortages. Modeled thresholds do not align well with historical realities and therefore suggest that a broader analysis of the combined natural and social drivers of change is needed to more effectively understand the hydrologic transformation taking place across the watershed. This article situates these new geographies of water and climate change in Peru within current global change research discussions to demonstrate how future coupled research models can inform broader scale questions of hydrologic change and water security across watersheds and regions. We provide a coupled historical analysis of glacier recession in the Cordillera Blanca, declining Santa River discharge, and alpine wetland contraction. We also examine various water withdrawal mechanisms, including smallholder agriculture, mining, potable water use, hydroelectric power generation, and coastal irrigation. We argue that both ecological change and societal forces will play vital roles in shaping the future of water resources and water governance in the region.

TI  - Risk aversion, cooperative membership, and path dependences of smallholder farmers in Ethiopia
T2  - REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - Smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa often mitigate production risks through cooperative membership: institutionalized arrangements where they pool resources and collectively manage production and marketing chains. Cooperative membership has a significant advantage: it cushions detrimental effects of external forces, placing a premium on a risk-seeking attitude (experimenting and innovating), which can yield greater accumulation. However, cooperatives are self-selective institutions: relatively better-endowed farmers, who are usually less risk-avoidant than poorer ones (a consequence of their broader material bases), tend to be overrepresented. These two realities complicate the causal assessment of the relationships between risk attitudes, farmers' socioeconomic status, and cooperative membership that is essential to comprehend the role of cooperatives in local capital accumulation. To help resolve this thorny analytical problem, an experimental study was carried out in eastern Ethiopia-a risky production environment where cooperatives feature prominently and relatively affluent farmers exist alongside poorer ones. It unveils the working of specific path dependences: poorer cooperative members are less risk seeking than nonmembers, but at an interval much less than that observed for affluent farmers. For development policies, this suggests that a greater payoff can be expected from investing in farmers' material bases than from further improving cooperative membership.

TI  - Climate shocks constrain human fertility in Indonesia
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Climate change is likely to induce a large range of household- and individual-level responses, including changes in human fertility behaviors and outcomes. These responses may have important implications for human and economic development and women's empowerment. Drawing on the literature linking climate conditions to rice cultivation in Indonesia, we use longitudinal household survey and high resolution climate data to explore changes in childbearing intentions, family planning use, and births following community-level climate shocks from 1993 to 2015. We find that fertility intentions increase and family planning use declines in response to delays in monsoon onset occurring within the previous year, particularly for wealthier populations. However, women on farms are significantly more likely to use family planning and less likely to give birth following abnormally high temperatures during the previous five years. We also measure parallel shifts in household well-being as measured by rice, food, and nonfood consumption expenditures. Our findings advance the environmental fertility literature by showing that longer duration environmental shocks can have impacts on fertility behaviors and outcomes. Collectively, our results illustrate human fertility responses to climate change in a country vulnerable to its effects, and demonstrate that in some cases, climate shocks can constrain human fertility.

TI  - Risk Management Strategies to Cope Catastrophic Risks in Agriculture: The Case of Contract Farming, Diversification and Precautionary Savings
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Risk management is an essential way for farmers to reduce uncertainty. In this research, a stratified random sampling method was used to survey 350 maize farmers in four different agro-ecological regions in Bangladesh. Using the multivariate probit model, this study explored the possible correlation between farmers' perceptions of catastrophic risks and their attitudes towards risk sources-as well as the possible correlation between contract farming, diversification and precautionary savings as risk management strategies. The results confirm the relevance of risk management adoption decisions and reveal that the use of one risk management tool may simultaneously influence the use of another risk management tool. In addition, the research results also show that age, education level, extension experience, monthly household income, farming areas, land ownership and risk aversion nature are the most important factors that affect the adoption of risk management strategies. The research results provide further explanation and information and provide a platform for decision-makers to predict appropriate risk management strategies.

TI  - Big is efficient: Evidence from agricultural cooperatives in Ethiopia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - In Ethiopia, there is a renewed interest in agricultural cooperatives as an institutional tool to improve the welfare of smallholder farmers. One of the pathways through which cooperatives benefit their members is scale economies. However, the establishment of cooperatives in Ethiopia seems to pay little attention to the size of the organizations. This article aims at investigating the effect of size on cost efficiency of agricultural cooperatives. More specifically, the purpose is to examine whether a single cooperative can serve a given number of farmers at a lower cost than two or more smaller cooperatives could. We employ the concept of cost subadditivity to compare the cost efficiency of large versus small cooperatives, and by extension unilateral actions. We estimate a flexible production technology using cross-sectional cooperative-level data. Findings show that costs would drop by 78% to 181% if farmers join hands in relatively large rather than small cooperatives.

TI  - Collaborative foundations of herding: The formation of cooperative groups among Tibetan pastoralists
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - The pastoral literature place little emphasis on the cooperative aspect of being a pastoralist. Part of the neglect stems from conflating the livestock owning unit, i.e. the household, with the herding group. Among Tibetan pastoralists, the herding group consist of people and animals from one or several households. They herd in groups because there is an optimal size of the herd concerning daily herding: too few animals and the animals disperse while too many negatively affect grazing efficiency and subsequently livestock survival during winter. The individual household also frees up members for e.g. selling or trading livestock products. Furthermore, group formation makes it possible to split herds into smaller sub-herds that consider differing needs for varying livestock species and age-categories. While herding groups can change both seasonally and annually, they are a fundamental unit for pastoral social organisation because they are concerned with daily cooperation.

TI  - Property rights, village democracy, and household forestry income: evidence from China's collective forest tenure reform
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - To investigate the effect of expanded property rights and, in particular, village democracy under China's Collective Forest Tenure Reform (CFTR) on household forestry income, we employ quantile regression, drawing on the survey data from 658 rural households in three provinces belonging to China's southern collective forest regions. The results indicate that: (1) both the expansion of household forestland property rights caused by CFTR and the village democratic procedure involved in the reform exert significant income effect; the income effect intensity of the expansion of forestland use right and disposal right is greater than that of beneficiary right, and the effect shows no significant difference among rural households with different forestry income scale. (2) the village democracy cannot only directly motivate rural household forestry income but also notably moderate the income effect of property rights expansion. Based on the above findings, this paper suggests that the forestland property right policy aimed at rural households be further refined, the rural households' policy awareness of CFTR be enhanced and the grass-roots bureaucratic system be prevented from over-intervening in the implementation of public policy so as to further improve CFTR and enhance rural households' forestry income.

TI  - Design and rationale of a matched cohort study to assess the effectiveness of a combined household-level piped water and sanitation intervention in rural Odisha, India
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction: Government efforts to address massive shortfalls in rural water and sanitation in India have centred on construction of community water sources and toilets for selected households. However, deficiencies with water quality and quantity at the household level and community coverage and actual use of toilets have led Gram Vikas, a local non-governmental organization in Odisha, India, to develop an approach that provides household-level piped water connections contingent on full community-level toilet coverage.
   Methods: This matched cohort study was designed to assess the effectiveness of a combined piped water and sanitation intervention. Households with children <5 years in 45 randomly selected intervention villages and 45 matched control villages will be followed over 17 months. The primary outcome is prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases; secondary health outcomes include soil-transmitted helminth infection, nutritional status, seroconversion to enteric pathogens, urogenital infections and environmental enteric dysfunction. In addition, intervention effects on sanitation and water coverage, access and use, environmental fecal contamination, women's empowerment, as well as collective efficacy, and intervention cost and cost-effectiveness will be assessed.
   Ethics and dissemination: The study protocol has been reviewed and approved by the ethics boards of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK and KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, India. Findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed literature and presentation to stakeholders, government officials, implementers and researchers.

TI  - In-kind conservation payments crowd in environmental values and increase support for government intervention: A randomized trial in Bolivia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - There is growing use of economic incentives such as Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) to encourage sustainable land management. An important critique is that such approaches may unintentionally disrupt environmental and social values, 'crowding out' pre-existing motivations to conserve. Some scholars suggest that the use of in-kind payments and norm-based framing, rather than financial transfers and a market framing, can mitigate these risks. There are calls to use more robust methods for impact evaluation in environmental policy. We use one of the only Randomized Controlled Trials of a conservation incentive scheme to evaluate its impact on self-stated environmental and social values and beliefs. Data from before and after the intervention, from households in villages randomly selected to receive the program or not, demonstrate that the program increased prioritization of environmental values (evidence of crowding-in as opposed to crowding out) and altered social beliefs related to inequality and the role of government. The findings demonstrate that this conservation program had a positive impact on environmental values and increased the belief that government involvement is appropriate. The scheme, with its use of in-kind payments and reciprocity framing, offers lessons to those seeking to develop effective schemes to incentivize positive environmental stewardship.

AB  - This article explores relationships between state, corporate capital and local stakeholders in the political economy of sugarcane from a gender perspective. The findings, based on empirical research at the site of Tanzania's largest sugarcane producer pre- and post-privatisation, provide insights into the degree to which the estate-outgrower model can be regarded as 'inclusive' for women and men. Three aspects of commercial sugarcane production are analysed: land tenure, labour and leadership within canegrowers' associations. We argue that politico-economic changes in the sector post-privatisation have increased gender differentiation in sugarcane production and consolidated power in the hands of local elites.

TI  - Village characteristics and health of rural Chinese older adults: Examining the CHARLS Pilot Study of a rich and poor province
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - Community (or village) characteristics have received growing attention as researchers have sought factors affecting health. This study examines the association between a variety of environmental, economic, and social village characteristics and health of Chinese older rural adults with health measured in terms of physical limitations. The Chinese Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS) Pilot Study data were used. Older villagers from a low-income province (Gansu) and a relatively wealthy province (Zhejiang) were surveyed between July and September, 2008. The sample included 1267 respondents in 73 villages age 45 and older. The relationship between a variety of village characteristics and physical limitations of older adults was examined using negative binomial regression (NBR) with standard errors adjusted to account for non-independence of respondents in a village. A comparison of means/percentages shows that Gansu and Zhejiang were significantly different on the dependent and most independent variables. The NBR models show that at the personal-level, decreased risk of physical limitations was associated with being male, less than 60 years old, married, higher in education, and higher in household expenditures (proxy for income). At the village-level, decreased risk of limitations was associated with a continuous supply of electricity, not using coal in the household, the existence of a sewage system, low cost of electricity, and village wealth. Decreased risk of physical limitations was also associated with various characteristics of China's New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), an insurance program for rural older adults. Policy implications for improved health of rural older adults include: (1) continued use of China's NCMS, (2) establishment of village sewage systems, (3) ending the use of coal in the home, and (4) increased educational opportunities focused on health.

TI  - Rural wood consumption patterns of local and immigrant households with differentiated access to resources in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, China
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - In Xishuangbanna, China, rubber production has spread rapidly, resulting in extensive land use changes and an increasing influx of migrant workers who have come to find work on the plantations. These migrant workers have limited access to subsidies and the local collective forest due to the household registration system in China called hukou. To assess how these policy-based restrictions on access affect wood consumption and local communities, a case study was conducted in Manlin village, Xishuangbanna, undertaking a household and weight survey with local and immigrant households. The results show no significant difference in firewood consumption between the subpopulations, despite predominantly more local than immigrant households have access to subsidised alternative energy sources. On the other hand, limited access to the collective forest is found to influence the choice of housing materials and living standards in immigrant households as they cannot access timber or afford brick houses. This paper highlights rural issues connected to the hukou system and suggests that rural energy and resource policies should take the growing population of immigrant workers into consideration in future to expand the reach of the polices to the de facto and not only de jure rural population and thus optimise policy efficiency.

TI  - Impact of the methods of groundwater access on irrigation and crop yield in the North China Plain Does climate matter?
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is: to track the methods by which farmers access groundwater for irrigation in the North China Plain (NCP); to explore whether climate factors influence farmers' decisions on the methods of groundwater access for irrigation; and to examine whether the amount of groundwater use for irrigation and crop yield systematically differ across groups of farmers using various methods of groundwater access, and how climate factors affect them.
   Design/methodology/approach - Descriptive statistical analysis and econometric models are used on household survey data collected over several years and county-level climate data.
   Findings - Over the past few decades, a significant share of farmers have switched the methods of groundwater access from collective tubewells to own tubewells or groundwater markets. Farmers who bought water from groundwater markets applied less water to wheat plots than those who had their own tubewells. However, wheat yield was not negatively affected. Both average climate conditions and long-term variations were found to be related to farmers' choice of methods of groundwater access for irrigation. More frequent droughts and increasingly volatile temperatures both increased the likelihood of farmers gaining groundwater irrigation from markets.
   Originality/value - The analysis results suggest farmers are using groundwater markets to help them adapt to climate change. Applying empirical analysis to identify the impact of the methods by which farmers access groundwater for irrigation on the amount of groundwater use and crop yield will help policy makers design reasonable adaptation policies for the NCP.

TI  - Hearth and Household Economy in an Andean Village
T2  - HUMAN ORGANIZATION
AB  - This study situates fuel collection and hearth activity in a rural village (Machu Picchu Historic Sanctuary, Cusco, Peru) as cultural practices essential to securing household and collective production and reproduction. The physical hearth is spatially fluid, allowing it to serve as material and symbolic center throughout the household's life cycle. All members from children to the elderly participate in fuel collection, providing a new means of defining household composition. Wood connects the house to uncultivated landscapes and supports reciprocal labor networks and community festivals. Gendered and intergenerational divisions of labor result in four types of collection trips involving different plant species, wood sizes, and source ecosystems. With increased tourism to Machu Picchu, daily and seasonal labor patterns are changing as men and women do tourism work and children are educated in town. The physical hearth becomes more mobile as houses are improved. Changing labor patterns mean women bear an increasing burden for meeting energy needs. This study advances understanding of Andean household economy and the impacts of global tourism on labor allocation and energy choices.

TI  - Managing risk, changing aspirations and household dynamics: Implications for wellbeing and adaptation in semi-arid Africa and India
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Semi-arid regions across Africa and Asia are characterized by rapidly changing biophysical regimes, structural vulnerabilities, and increasing livelihood precarity. Gender, class, and caste/ethnic identities and relationships, and the specific social, economic and political power, roles and responsibilities they entail, shape the choices and decisions open to individuals and households in managing the risks they face. Unpacking the multiple, intersecting inequalities confronting rural populations in these climate hotspots is therefore vital to understand how risk can be managed in a way that supports effective, inclusive, and sustainable local adaptation. Drawing on empirical evidence from six countries, generated through a mixed methods approach, we examine how changes in household dynamics, structure, and aspirations, shape risk management with implications for household well-being, adaptive capacity, and ultimately sustainable development. The ability of individuals within households, differentiated by age, marital status, or education, to manipulate the very structure of the household and the material and social resources it offers, differentiates risk management strategies such as livelihood diversification, migration, changing agricultural practices and leveraging social support. Our evidence suggests that while greater risks can drive conflictive behavior within households, with women often reporting lower subjective wellbeing, new forms of cooperative behavior are also emerging, especially in peni-urban spaces. Through this study, we identify entry points into enabling sustainable and inclusive adaptation behavior, emphasizing that interventions should work for both women and men by challenging inequitable social and gender norms and renegotiating the domains of work and cooperation to maintain overall household wellbeing.

TI  - Has China's new round of collective forest reforms caused an increase in the use of productive forest inputs?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Forestland tenure and financial incentives are the most important policy issue to sustainable forest resource management. The new wave of reform of collective forestland tenure (NRCFT) has been launched since 2003 and the governmental matching reform measures (MRMs) for the NRCFT have been introduced since 2009. The objective of these reforms is to enhance sustainable forest resource management in Chinese collective regions by encouraging rural households' productive forest inputs. We use a unique dataset of 1778 sample households in 18 counties of nine provinces with six years and employ a fixed effects model with clustered standard errors. Our empirical results indicate that: 1) the NRCFT has increased households' forestland area of different tenure types, and the effects of the MRMs on rural households' labor input and production expenditures for forestry purposes are generally positive, especially household used forestland as collateral for a loan and afforestation or reafforestation subsidy and reform of Annual Allowance Cut (AAC) have significantly contributed to increase in the use of productive forest inputs; 2) the NRCFT and the MRMs have different impacts on the use of productive forest inputs for different tenure forests, and these reforms have caused the most significant changes in rural households' production decision changes for household responsibility forestland; 3) both the NRCFT and the MRMs have significant effects on rural households' rent-in and rent-out forestland; and 4) forestland fragmentations have caused additional labor and investment inputs for rural households' forest resource management and protection. And finally, market drivers and household and village characteristics factors also affect households' decisions for productive inputs for their managing forests. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Social capital, collective action and access to water in rural Kenya
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - Globally, an estimated 748 million people remain without access to improved sources of drinking water and close to 1 billion people practice open defecation (WHO/UNICEF, 2014). The lack of access to safe water and adequate sanitation presents significant health and development challenges to individuals and communities, especially in low and middle income countries. Recent research indicates that aside from financial challenges, the lack of social capital is a barrier to collective action for community based water and sanitation initiatives (Levison et al., 2011; Bisung and Elliott, 2014). This paper reports results of a case study on the relationships between elements of social capital and participation in collective action in the context of addressing water and sanitation issues in the lakeshore village of Usoma, Western Kenya. The paper uses household data (N = 485, 91% response rate) collected using a modified version of the social capital assessment tool (Krishna and Shrader, 2000). Findings suggest that investment in building social capital may have some contextual benefits for collective action to address common environmental challenges. These findings can inform policy interventions and practice in water and sanitation delivery in low and middle income countries, environmental health promotion and community development.

TI  - Development of land rental markets and agricultural productivity growth: The case of northern Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES
AB  - Short-term land leases have an important role to play for efficient land management and agricultural development, especially when land sales and mortgages are prohibited and markets for other factor inputs are imperfect or missing. This study utilises data from the highlands of northern Ethiopia to examine the evolution since 1991 of land rental markets, factors contributing to the changes and impact of the changes on land productivity growth. Use of fixed-rent lease and 50-50 sharecropping arrangements have increased substantially and are the dominant forms of land rental. The major factors contributing to the increase in use of land rental arrangements include change in the production environment, change in access to credit, commercialisation of cereal production, change in human capital and change in tenure security. The increase in use of land rental markets has had a positive impact on change in average cereal yields and the impacts associated with increases in use of fixed-rent leases or sharecropping arrangements are not statistically different. Together, the results suggest that land tenure arrangements are indeed dynamic and have evolved in a manner that has eliminated any Marshallian inefficiencies associated with share tenancy.

TI  - Adoption factors and structural characteristics of irrigated olive grove agroforestry systems in Central Tunisia
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Irrigated olive grove agroforestry systems in the Southern Mediterranean have rarely been studied. In the context of increased interest for agroecological approaches, this study questions why and how farmers undertake such associations, in the case of smallholder irrigated agriculture in Tunisia. The objectives were to characterize the physical structure of existing olive-summer vegetable associations and describe the rationales of farmers implementing them. Quantitative and qualitative approaches were used to collect data from 132 olive groves and 31 semi-directive interviews in the Merguellil plain, Central Tunisia. Dual crop input-intensive agroforestry systems were predominant, although agroforestry structures with a high species' diversity also existed. Adoption reasons and implementation of agroforestry systems varied. The latter were often perceived as an economically viable solution in a context of difficult access to productive resources. Particularly, limited and fragmented access to land or water was a strong driver of adoption, inducing contractual arrangements between farmers to share resources. Farmers implemented agroforestry systems mainly to maximize income, reduce production costs or reduce risks through a crop diversification strategy. Most characterized agroforestry olive-summer vegetable associations may fail to meet the principles of agroecology. Being already adopted by farmers, they may however serve as a base to conceive improved cropping systems.

TI  - The impacts of trade and self-sufficiency policies on heterogeneous rice farms in Malaysia
T2  - REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper develops a farm household model of heterogeneous Malaysian rice farmers. The model determines the domestic price of milled rice in equilibrium. The model is simulated to analyze the effects of free trade, self-sufficiency achieved through trade policy, and the impact of free trade and self-sufficiency when rice productivity expands. The ex ante results for free trade predict that total rice supply rises as the increase in imports offsets the decrease in domestic production, causing the domestic price of milled rice to fall by 15.8 percent. While this price decrease generates negative income effects for rice farmers, it leads to an expansion of consumption of milled rice by both the farm and urban populations. The results for self-sufficiency through heightened tariffs predict that production for domestic rice farmers increases. However, with fewer imports, total rice supply falls, causing the domestic price of rice to increase by 41.5 percent. Because free trade is politically unfeasible and trade-driven self-sufficiency policies contract total rice consumption, boosting rice production through research and development is an effective way for Malaysia to increase the total supply of rice while limiting its dependence on imports.

TI  - Practical crossbreeding for improved livelihoods in developing countries: The FARM Africa goat project
T2  - LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
AB  - Successful livestock improvement programmes focusing on low-input smallholder production systems though rare, are possible using community-based approaches. This paper outlines important design and implementation components of a goat improvement programme undertaken by FARM Africa in the eastern highlands of Kenya. Through strong capacity building initiatives at grass-roots level, producers were empowered to undertake a goat genetic improvement programme that benefitted them in several ways. This resulted in the farmers forming their own umbrella organizations to cater for their interests as producers in accessing animal health and breeding services, production inputs, and marketing goats and goat products. In seven years, the population of improved goats in one of the project areas increased from 2100 to 5500, and the livelihoods of the participating farmers improved. Income from sales of milk and improved breeding and slaughter stock increased, while food security improved as a result of daily milk consumption and improved crop yields resulting from use of the rich goat manure. The project has, however, faced challenges arising mainly from the popularity of the improved goats within the Eastern Africa region, which has resulted in sale of a large number of the young animals, leaving few replacements within the project area. Uptake of goat breeding by private commercial farmers to provide breeding stock and replacement animals is currently lacking. Further research and evaluation is required on how to strengthen collective-action based institutions to improve services within smallholder farmer communities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Role of social capital in response to and recovery from the first wave of COVID-19 in Thailand: a qualitative study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - ObjectiveThis study assesses the role of social capital among people and communities in response to the first wave of the pandemic in 2020.DesignQualitative study using focus group discussions.SettingCapital city (Bangkok) and the four regions (north, northeast, south and central) of Thailand.Participants161 participants of 19 focus groups with diverse backgrounds in terms of gender, profession, education and geography (urban/rural; regions). They are selected for different levels of impact from the pandemic.FindingsThe solidarity among the Thai people was a key contributing factor to societal resilience during the pandemic. Findings illustrate how three levels of social capital structure-family, community and local networks-mobilised resources from internal and external social networks to support people affected by the pandemic. The results also highlight different types of resources mobilised from the three levels of social capital, factors that affect resilience, collective action to combat the negative impacts of the pandemic, and the roles of social media and gender.ConclusionSocial capital plays significant roles in the resilience of individuals, households and communities to respond to and recover from the impacts of the pandemic. In many instances, social capital is a faster and more efficient response than other kinds of formal support. Social capital can be enhanced by interactions and exchanges in the communities. While face-to-face social contacts are challenged by the need for social distancing and travel restrictions, social media steps in as alternative socialisation to enhance social capital.

TI  - State Socialism and the Rural Household: How Women's Handloom Weaving (and Pig-Raising, Firewood-Gathering, Food-Scavenging) Subsidized Chinese Accumulation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIAL HISTORY
AB  - Massive, rapid capital accumulation is usually associated with capitalist development, but historically, socialist states were among the most aggressive accumulators. Accumulation in Maoist China was faster than even in Stalin's Soviet Union, despite the fact that China was a much poorer country with fewer natural resources. China's accumulation rate, defined as the ratio of gross capital formation to gross national income, reached twenty-five to thirty per cent in 1957-1962, peaking at forty-four per cent in 1958. This level proved to be unsustainable, but after a slowdown in the early 1960s, the rate rose back to thirty-six percent.' As is well known, the cost of China's rapid industrialization was borne mostly by its rural population. 2 My aim in this chapter is to show that it was disproportionally borne by rural women, who contributed to socialist accumulation in direct and indirect ways: directly, as collective farmers, growers of the grain, cotton, soy, tea, sugarcane, etc. that fueled industrialization; and indirectly, by biologically, socially, and materially reproducing the country's labor force and by submitting to a regime of extreme austerity that allowed the government to extract scarce resources and direct them to the cities and the export trade. My argument proceeds in three steps. I will begin with an overview of socialist primitive accumulation under Mao, its preconditions and mechanisms, and the ways it replicated earlier Soviet policies or diverged from them. Next, I will discuss the various ways in which rural women's work underpinned capital accumulation and laid the foundation for China's rapid industrialization in the years since Mao's death. Finally, I will look in some detail at rural women's work at home, to show how their self-exploitation, overwork, and underconsumption in the domestic realm created the conditions for accumulation. My focus is on cotton work both cotton cultivation and domestic cloth production - but I will also look at other ways in which domestic work supported accumulation.

TI  - Modifiable risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease and mortality in China: a PURE substudy
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Aims To examine the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in China and in key subpopulations, and to estimate the population-level risks attributable to 12 common modifiable risk factors for each outcome. Methods and results In this prospective cohort of 47 262 middle-aged participants from 115 urban and rural communities in 12 provinces of China, it was examined how CVD incidence and mortality rates varied by sex, by urban-rural area, and by region. In participants without prior CVD, population-attributable fractions (PAFs) for CVD and for death related to 12 common modifiable risk factors were assessed: four metabolic risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, and lipids), four behavioural risk factors (tobacco, alcohol, diet quality, and physical activity), education, depression, grip strength, and household air pollution. The mean age of the cohort was 51.1 years. 58.2% were female, 49.2% were from urban areas, and 59.6% were from the eastern region of China. The median follow-up duration was 11.9 years. The CVD was the leading cause of death in China (36%). The rates of CVD and death were 8.35 and 5.33 per 1000 person-years, respectively, with higher rates in men compared with women and in rural compared with urban areas. Death rates were higher in the central and western regions of China compared with the eastern region. The modifiable risk factors studied collectively contributed to 59% of the PAF for CVD and 56% of the PAF for death in China. Metabolic risk factors accounted for the largest proportion of CVD (PAF of 41.7%), and hypertension was the most important risk factor (25.0%), followed by low education (10.2%), high non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (7.8%), and abdominal obesity (6.9%). The largest risk factors for death were hypertension (10.8%), low education (10.5%), poor diet (8.3%), tobacco use (7.5%), and household air pollution (6.1%). Conclusion Both CVD and mortality are higher in men compared with women, and in rural compared with urban areas. Large reductions in CVD could potentially be achieved by controlling metabolic risk factors and improving education. Lowering mortality rates will require strategies addressing a broader range of risk factors.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF THE CORRELATION BETWEEN GROUP HETEROGENEITY AND THE SELF-GOVERNANCE PERFORMANCE OF SMALL-SCALE WATER CONSERVANCY FACILITIES: BASED ON THE THRESHOLD MODEL OF THE NUMBER OF WATER USER HOUSEHOLDS dagger
T2  - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
AB  - Small-scale water conservancy facilities are common-pool resources, the self-governance performance of which is key to reducing farming costs and determines whether farmers' demand for irrigation is met. The self-governance performance of small-scale water conservancy facilities is closely related to institutional arrangements, such as group heterogeneity and the size of the group that use water. According to the stratified random sampling data of 105 villages and 1549 farmers in Hubei, China, and based on the standardization and principal component factor analysis of the variables, the threshold model of the number of water user households is used to analyse the correlation between group heterogeneity and the self-governance performance of small-scale water conservancy facilities. The results show that there is a significant positive correlation between group heterogeneity and the self-governance performance of small-scale water conservancy facilities in small-sized villages, a non-significant correlation in middle-sized villages, and a significant negative correlation in large-sized villages; thus, there is an inverse U-shaped relationship between them. The policy enlightenment is as follows: (i) small-sized villages should accelerate land circulation, and the new-style agricultural management subjects should adopt a centralized decision-making manner; (ii) large-sized villages should establish civil organizations, such as water users' associations and agricultural professional cooperatives.

TI  - The View from the Farm: Gendered Contradictions of the Measurement Imperative in Global Goals
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND CAPABILITIES
AB  - How do global development goals translate into local action? How do such goals support or undermine already existing efforts, at the local level, to build robust and sustainable communities? In this article we examine the experience of a women's cooperative vegetable farm in rural South Africa, considering the on-the-ground consequences of high-level planning for development and, in particular, the measurement and accountability demands associated with such initiatives. We focus on the broad aims of Sustainable Development Goals 2 (to end hunger) and 5 (to achieve gender equality and women's empowerment). We explore farmers' responses to external demands for measurement and accountability, some of which they are not well equipped to meet and others of which collide with their own priorities to support their households and wider community. We find a major problem of translation between global goals and the needs of people on the ground: far from resulting in material support for small-scale farmers, the daily burdens of the 'audit society' directly impede aims like ending hunger and achieving gender equality. The first section of the paper briefly canvasses recent efforts at global goal setting, considering the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and SDGs in turn. The longer second section offers the case study of the women's farm, examining how the measurement demands related to global goals impact locally generated priorities.

TI  - ?We left the crop there lying in the field?: Agricultural worker experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic in a rural US-Mexico border region
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - California agricultural workers are predominately Latino/a, are medically underserved, and reside in larger households, placing them at elevated COVID-19 risk at work and at home. While some research has examined COVID-19 among agricultural workers in the interior of the United States, little research exists on experiences of COVID-19 along the US-Mexico border. Grounded in resilience thinking, this study aims to understand how agricultural workers navigated their heightened risk to COVID-19 at work and at home, and made use of available resources in the context of a bi-national community. Our study utilized qualitative interviews with 12 agricultural workers to understanding the COVID-19 experiences of resident and daily migrant agricultural workers in Imperial County, California, located along the US-Mexico border. Findings suggest that agricultural workers faced significant impacts and risks at work (work stoppages, stress about bringing COVID-19 home to family) and at home (contracting COVID-19, loss of friends and family, and mental health challenges). Agricultural workers and their employers often implemented COVID-19 precautions such as social distancing measures, personal protective equipment, hand washing and hand sanitizers, and isolation. Many agricultural workers did access testing resources on either side of the US-Mexico border and worked with US-based Spanishspeaking community-based organizations to register for vaccine appointments. To better support agricultural workers and their employers in the future, we recommend the following: 1. Prioritize agricultural workplace conditions to increase agricultural worker physical and mental health, 2. Extend public health services into agricultural work sites of transit and the workplace, and 3. Lastly, trusted Spanish-speaking community-based organizations can play a critical role in public health outreach.

TI  - Collective Efficacy: Development and Validation of a Measurement Scale for Use in Public Health and Development Programmes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Impact evaluations of water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions have demonstrated lower than expected health gains, in some cases due to low uptake and sustained adoption of interventions at a community level. These findings represent common challenges for public health and development programmes relying on collective action. One possible explanation may be low collective efficacy (CE)-perceptions regarding a group's ability to execute actions related to a common goal. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a metric to assess factors related to CE. We conducted this research within a cluster-randomised sanitation and hygiene trial in Amhara, Ethiopia. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were carried out to examine underlying structures of CE for men and women in rural Ethiopia. We produced three CE scales: one each for men and women that allow for examinations of gender-specific mechanisms through which CE operates, and one 26-item CE scale that can be used across genders. All scales demonstrated high construct validity. CE factor scores were significantly higher for men than women, even among household-level male-female dyads. These CE scales will allow implementers to better design and target community-level interventions, and examine the role of CE in the effectiveness of community-based programming.

TI  - Three Rights Separation reform and its impact over farm?s productivity: A case study of China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - In recent years, China introduced the new "Three Rights Separation" land reforms which has fostered the agricultural productivity in the country. Using data from China Labour Force Dynamics Survey (CLDS), the current study aims to examine the impact of the "Three Rights Separation" of contracted land on agricultural productivity in China. The PSM method is primarily used for impact evaluation. The estimated results show that the farms' management rights registration and certification, and the three rights significantly increased the agricultural productivity and income. However, the impact effect caused by uncoordinated policy mechanisms and relatively slow application of right recognition did not significantly increase farmers' agricultural production income. Having access to formal financial institutions and specializing in the production of crops directly correlated with a positive marginal effect on agricultural production and household's income.

TI  - Social roles, human capital, and the intrahousehold division of labor: evidence from Pakistan
T2  - OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES
AB  - Using detailed data from rural Pakistan, this paper investigates whether human capital, learning-by-doing, gender, and family status affect the division of labor within households. Results suggest the presence of returns to individual specialization in all farm, non-farm, and home based activities. The intrahousehold division of labor is influenced by comparative advantage based on human capital and by long-lasting returns to learning-by-doing, but we also find evidence of a separate effect of gender and family status. Households seem to operate as hierarchies with sexually segregated spheres of activity. The head of household and his or her spouse provide most of the labor within their respective spheres of influence; other members work less. When present in the household, daughters-in-law work systematically harder than daughters of comparable age, height, and education. Other findings of interest are that there are increasing returns to scale in most household chores, that larger households work more off farm, and that better educated individuals enjoy more leisure.

TI  - Environmental Movements in Turkey from the Perspective of Commons
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS
AB  - Enclosure movements on the commons continue without slowing down especially in the developing countries; as well as the grassroots movements against them. Enclosure movements frequently contain several foreign investments and appropriations to other uses on natural resources and/or assets such as pastures, forests, rivers, agricultural lands and seashores, which are crucial income sources for rural households. Among other factors, the shortcomings in the common management processes, cooperatives and self-organization capacity of the stakeholders ease the enclosure process. The study investigates the environmental movements as commoning practices in Turkey in the last decade through media analysis and surveys. The study aims to constitute a scientific basis to enhance the EIA processes in order to encourage proactive responses to environmental crises, prevent enclosure movements on the commons and maintain the local sustainable development. Hence, firstly the environmental movements in Turkey are spatialized by GIS analyst tools to constitute an environmental inventory including time, types, frequency and location of the movements; secondly, an online survey is conducted with the environmental NGOs; thirdly, two possible scenarios are suggested through a triple-scale scoring system; and finally, several recommendations are proposed in order to sustain the commons.

The findings show that the value of the NCMS to recipients is slightly lower than the government's costs of implementation, ranging from 0.79 to 0.97 per RMB of the resource cost of the NCMS. The estimated moral hazard costs are low compared with the total benefits. It is also estimated that the benefits originating from the NCMS's insurance function only constitute 20% of the total benefits, suggesting a need for higher generosity levels among rural households. Our results shed new light on the welfare effects of access health insurance among low- and middle-income households.

TI  - Opportunities and Challenges for Lebanese Horticultural Producers Linked to Corporate Buyers
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - This paper aims to analyze procurement decisions and contractual arrangements in the horticultural supply chain and evaluate opportunities for and challenges of horticultural producers linked to supermarkets and corporate restaurants in Lebanon. Accordingly, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with key horticultural supply chain actors in Lebanon. The study finds that corporate restaurants offer more opportunities for large horticultural producers and suppliers than supermarkets. Yet, corporate restaurants have more stringent quality requirements, as demonstrated by food safety certifications, and their contractual relationships are binding, symbiotic, and formal. Supermarkets source most of their products from wholesale markets and have opportunistic, non-binding relationships with their suppliers. In sum, the nature of the business relationships between horticultural producers and suppliers and corporate buyers depends on the ability of the producers to meet the quality requirements of the latter. Although corporate buyers have shown some interest in the local produce, they are yet to invest in local supplier development initiatives to enhance the capabilities of producers. Instead, corporate buyers resort to imports when the local producers fail to meet the quality standards or required volumes. The study suggests several alternative routes to enhance the market position of horticultural producers and suppliers in Lebanon.

TI  - The impact of cooperative participation on income: the case of vegetable production in Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The demand for clean vegetables has rapidly increased, many farmers gradually turn to vegetable cultivation to increase income; therefore, agricultural cooperative mobilized farmers group to facilitate them access to technical training and enhance compliance with the Vietnamese Good Agricultural Practices (VietGAP) standards. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impacts of the participation on farmer's income as well as the major factors that affect the participation in cooperatives by the vegetable farmers in Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach The study used primary data collected from vegetable farmers in Vietnam. This study utilized propensity score matching to avoid initial selection bias. The differences between participants and nonparticipants will be adjusted by matching each membership individual to a nonmember based on similar observable characteristics by summarizing the conditional probability of a member given pretreatment characteristics. Findings This study demonstrates that participation in cooperatives is significantly affected by ethnicity, age of household head, labor involving vegetable production and extension service access. The results of this study also confirm that agricultural cooperatives have positive effects on member farmers to enhance income and that participants - on average - have a higher income than nonparticipants. Research limitations/implications The method cannot rule out the possibility of selection bias due to unobserved differences between participants and even an appropriate comparison group. Originality/value This study contributes to an improved understanding about impacts of cooperatives on farmers' income in developing and emerging economies. Moreover, research also upgrades knowledge regarding the effectiveness of agricultural cooperatives in Vietnam, as well as guides policymakers in supporting the cooperatives in expanding the market and other necessary changes.

TI  - The impact of the new cooperative medical scheme on financial burden of tuberculosis patients: evidence from six counties in China
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB  - Background: Tuberculosis (TB) patients in China encounter heavy financial burdens throughout the course of their treatment and it is unclear how China's health insurance systems affect the alleviation of this burden under the integrated approach. This study aimed to measure reimbursement for TB services under the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) in rural China and to evaluate changes in catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) caused by the reimbursement policies.
   Methods: Reimbursement data were obtained from routine data systems for the NCMS in Yichang (YC) and Hanzhong (HZ). 1884 TB inpatients reimbursed by NCMS from 2010 to 2012 were included. Household surveys were conducted. A total of 494 TB patients under the NCMS were selected in this paper. 12 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were held. We measured the impact of the NCMS by counterfactual analysis, which analyzed the financial burden alleviation. Equity was assessed by Concentration Index (CI), and disaggregated by project sites.
   Results: TB inpatients were reimbursed with an effective reimbursement rate of 57.3 %. Average out-of-pocket (OOP) payments for outpatient and inpatient services after diagnosis were 1413 yuan and 430 yuan, and 3572 yuan and 3013 yuan in YC and HZ, respectively. The reimbursement level for TB outpatient care after diagnosis was very low due to a limited outpatient quota. TB patients in HZ incurred higher effective reimbursement rates, but the incidence of CHE remained higher. The reduction of CHE incidence after the NCMS showed no difference statistically (P > 0.05). The severity of CHE was alleviated slightly. CIs after reimbursement were all below zero and their absolute values were higher than those before reimbursement.
   Conclusions: Low reimbursement for TB patients could lead to heavy financial burden. Poor TB patients incurred high rates of CHE. The NCMS was found to be a protective factor for CHE, but the impact was modest and the equity of CHE did not improve. The NCMS reimbursement policies should be improved in the future to include a more comprehensive coverage of care. Supplemental programs may be necessary to expand coverage for TB care.

TI  - The Front-End's Lending Decision System for the Agricultural Bank in Thailand
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS JOURNAL
AB  - The main objective of this study is to develop the front-end's lending decision system of the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives, a major lender in Thailand's agricultural sector. The logit model and the artificial neural network model have been developed to reflect risk factors to identify the probability of default by each new borrower. The study supports the use of the logit model to develop the system because it gives more accuracy in predicting the probability of default and debtor classification than the artificial neural network model. The working process of the system is classified into two sections including credit risk management, which is the process of screening the loan applications and setting the credit approval or rejection criteria, and affordability risk management, which is the process of determining the maximum loan amount for the debtor who has passed the credit approval criteria. In this study, the author caps the debt service ratio as a threshold for determining the amount of credit (the loan amount approved and interest expense) at 70% and determines that the maximum loan principal is 63% of the debtor's total annual income. The system is also used as an instrument to support the implementation of appropriate credit policies in handling agricultural households' excess debt and promote the building of financial discipline for agricultural households in the rural sector of Thailand.

TI  - Perceptions of Improved Biomass and Liquefied Petroleum Gas Stoves in Puno, Peru: Implications for Promoting Sustained and Exclusive Adoption of Clean Cooking Technologies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Many households in low- and middle-income countries cook with inefficient biomass-burning stoves, which cause high levels of household air pollution and threaten long-term health. Although clean stoves and fuels are available, uptake and consistent use has been low. Using observations and in-depth interviews, we assessed the attitudes, preferences, and beliefs about traditional versus liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stoves in rural Puno, Peru. A total of 31 in-depth interviews were conducted with primary cooks and their families, health workers, community leaders, and improved stove contractors. Six in-home observations of meal preparation were also conducted. Six major barriers to consistent use of clean stoves were identified: (1) perceived differences in food taste and nutrition by stove type; (2) cooking niches filled by different stoves; (3) social norms related to cooking practices; (4) safety concerns; (5) comparative costs of using different stoves; and (6) lack of awareness and concern about long-term health risks. These findings suggest that to successfully reduce household air pollution, clean cooking programs and policies must consider the many factors influencing adoption beyond health, such as cost, taste, fears, and cultural traditions. These factors could be incorporated into community-based and national efforts to scale-up sustained and exclusive adoption of clean cooking.

TI  - Community-based grassland management in Western China - Rationale, pilot project experience, and policy implications
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Grassland degradation in China is widely perceived to be accelerating, and the. blame is often placed by government officials and researchers on a supposed "tragedy of the commons." Grassland policy seeks to address this through the establishment of household tenure and the derivation and external enforcement of household, stocking rates. Drawing upon the authors' field research at a number of sites in western. China, this article argues that the actual tenure situation is not as open access as is commonly implied and that existing forms of community-based management (including collective and small group tenure) are advantageous, given the socioeconomic and ecological context. Among other things, community-based management can facilitate low-cost external exclusion, economies of size in herd supervision, equal access to pastoral resources, the mitigation of environmental risk, and the prompt resolution of grassland-related disputes, Recent innovative attempts to both improve and formalize collective and group tenure arrangements indicate that there is a wide range of different possible grassland tenure-management models available, in addition to the household tenure-household management model emphasized in grassland policy. China's revised Grassland Law (2003), arguably provides legal space for these alternative models. However, for the future of community-based grassland management to be secure, implementing. agencies need to be more aware of these alternative models and. have the willingness and capacity to adopt a flexible and participatory approach to grassland policy implementation.

TI  - Impact of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme on the trend of catastrophic health expenditure in Chinese rural households: results from nationally representative surveys from 2003 to 2013
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objective To evaluate the trend of catastrophic health expenses (CHE) for inpatient care in relation to the commencement of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) in rural China from 2003 to 2013, and the roles of NCMS in protecting affected households from CHE.
   Methods We assessed the 10-year trend of the incidence and severity of CHE in rural households with hospitalised members using data from the Chinese National Health Services Survey. Generalised estimating equations were used to estimate the OR and 95% CI of the association between incidence rates of CHE (RCHE) and NCMS reimbursement.
   Results The incidence and severity of CHE after NCMS reimbursement both decreased and their changes increased rapidly from 2003 to 2013. After adjustment of the covariates, RCHE before reimbursement was significantly higher than that after reimbursement, and the OR (95% CI) was 1.50 (1.24 to 1.81), 1.79 (1.69 to 1.90) and 2.94 (2.77 to 3.11) in 2003, 2008 and 2013, respectively.
   Conclusion The incidence and severity of CHE both reduced after NCMS reimbursements in each year. Excluding some confounding factors, RCHE was significantly associated with NCMS reimbursement. NCMS partly protected the rural households with hospitalised members from CHE. However, the inequalities between different income groups still existed. RCHE in rural households with hospitalised members was still rather high in 2003, 2008 and 2013 even though they were covered by NCMS. This study will provide suggestions for further reforms in China and guidance for other low-income/middle-income countries.

TI  - Investigating factors responsible for farmers' abandonment of Jatropha curcas L. as bioenergy crop under smallholder out-grower schemes in Chibombo District, Zambia
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - The early 2000s witnessed a global awareness on adoption of renewable and environmentally friendly energy with anticipated socio-economic benefits in developing countries. Jatropha curcas. L. (Jatropha) was the main bioenergy crop adopted for production under out-grower schemes in Zambia. However, recent studies report worldwide abandonment of Jatropha production. This study therefore investigated factors responsible for the abandonment of Jatropha production under out-grower schemes in Chibombo District, Zambia. A total of 110 smallholder farmers who participated in these out-grower schemes and one key informant were selected using snowball sampling. Primary data was collected using field observations and a cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire administered through face-to-face interviews. Findings reveal that abandonment of Jatropha production was mainly driven by lack of market for the produce, and non-commitment of the sponsoring firm to contractual agreements under the out-grower schemes. Thus, more than 90% of the farmers did not earn income from the sale of Jatropha. To achieve optimal performance of these out-grower schemes, a supporting policy environment and legal framework enforcing compliance to contractual agreements are required. Further, such should be accompanied by creation of market opportunities for the crop as well as its price regulation.

TI  - Systemic small-player market exclusion in an east African context
T2  - CONSUMPTION MARKETS & CULTURE
AB  - Producer-consumers in Kenya and Uganda face challenges in meeting their subsistence goals. They face a paradoxical inclusion and exclusion from the contemporary market system that the solutions proposed in the agriculture development, subsistence markets and BOP perspectives cannot address because of faults in the pervasive marketing ecosystem perspective. In this article, we go beyond the traditional discussion of producer-consumers' market access, to include upstream as well as downstream challenges. We introduce the concept of integration gaps to markets as a counterpoint to typical measures of market access. We show the integration gap is a systematic neocolonialist exclusion of producer-consumers that international aid agencies exhorting greater market engagement may worsen. We offer suggestions for improvement from a marketing ecosystem perspective.

TI  - Does private sector involvement improve the distribution efficiency of subsidized fertilizer? A natural experiment from Nepal
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Despite the government spending significant amounts on fertilizer subsidies, Nepal's average fertilizer application rate is lower than in other South Asian countries. The low application is attributed to poor access to fertilizer and an inefficient distribution system. The government of Nepal issued a "Fertilizer Distribution Directive (FDD) 2020" to improve the distribution system. We assessed the impacts of involving the private sector in selling fertilizer to farmers. We examined whether the market transaction cost proxied by farmers' search cost (communication and travel cost), travel time to visit the stores, and the opportunity cost of time spent in purchasing fertilizer have been reduced by FDD 2020. A difference-in-difference approach refined with propensity score matching was used to estimate the fertilizer distribution efficiency using survey data from 619 households across six districts. Private sector involvement was found to reduce travel time to fertilizer retailers by about 10 min and transaction costs to purchase subsidized fertilizer by about 20 Nepalese Rupees (NPR) per season, compared to the conventional approach of sale by farmer cooperatives. Implementation of the directive has removed the bias of cooperatives selling fertilizer only to members, especially medium and large-scale farmers. The directive and private sector involvement have led to a more equitable and efficient distribution of subsidized fertilizer. However, the government should routinely monitor and regulate the fertilizer mainly targeted to the private fertilizer retailers.

TI  - Livelihood strategy change and land use change -Case of Danzam Village in upper Dadu River watershed, Tibetan Plateau of China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Land use change in rural China since the 1980s, induced by institution reforms, urbanization, industrialization and population increase, has received more attention. However, case studies on how institution reforms affect farmers' livelihood strategies and drive land use change are scarce. By means of cropland plots investigations and interviews with farmers, this study examines livelihood strategy change and land use change in Danzam Village of Jinchuan County in the upper Dadu River watershed, eastern Tibetan Plateau, China. The results show that, during the collective system period, as surplus labor forces could not be transferred to the secondary and tertiary industries, they had to choose agricultural involution as their livelihood strategy, then the farmers had to produce more grains by land reclamation, increasing multiple cropping index, improving input of labor, fertilizer, pesticide and adopting advanced agricultural techniques. During the household responsibility system period, as labors being transferred to the secondary and tertiary industries, farmers chose livelihood diversification strategy. Therefore, labor input to grain planting was greatly reduced, which drove the transformation of grain to horticulture, vegetable or wasteland and decrease of multiple cropping index. This study provides a new insight into understanding linkages among institution reforms, livelihood strategy of smallholders and land use change in rural China.

TI  - Climate Change Perceptions by Smallholder Coffee Farmers in the Northern and Southern Highlands of Tanzania
T2  - CLIMATE
AB  - Smallholder farmers are among the most vulnerable groups to climate change. Efforts to enhance farmers' adaptation to climate change are hindered by lack of information on how they are experiencing and responding to climate change. Therefore, this paper examines smallholder farmers' perceptions of climate change, factors influencing their perceptions, and the impacts and adaptation strategies adopted over the past three to four decades. A list of farmers was obtained from the Agricultural Marketing Cooperative Society (AMCOS) and filtered on the basis of age and farming experience. In order to explore factors influencing household perceptions of climate change, a structured questionnaire was administered to the randomly selected household heads. Data on rainfall and temperature were acquired from Lyamungo and Burka Coffee estate (Northern Highlands zone) and Mbimba and Mbinga (Southern Highlands zone) offices of the Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA) with the exception of data from Burka Coffee estate, which were acquired from a private operator. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to analyze the data. Farmers' perceptions were consistent with meteorological data both pointing to significant decline in rainfall and increase in temperature since 1979. Factors such as level of education, farming experience, and access to climate information influenced farmers' perception on climate change aspects. Based on these results, it is recommended to enhance timely and accurate weather information delivery along with developing institutions responsible for education and extension services provision. The focus of education or training should be on attenuating the impacts of climate change through relevant adaptation measures in each coffee-growing region.

TI  - The changing agrarian economy in Zimbabwe, 15 years after the Fast Track Land Reform programme
T2  - REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB  - The reconfigured agrarian structure imposed new production and commoditisation patterns across the settlement types in Zimbabwe. From 2000, new markets were established, with differentiated effects on capital accumulation for different sets of farmers. After the Fast Track Land Reform programme, the impact of the economy-wide challenges, climate change, capital and global geo-politics on the agrarian economy remain relatively unexplored. Using a case study of Hwedza District, this article reveals the changing agrarian relations beyond the trimodal agrarian structure, showing that smallholder farmers have significantly relied on reinvestment of agricultural sales proceeds rather than contract farming. Farmers exit the contract farming arrangements citing their exploitative nature. The article contributes to the debate on Zimbabwe's agrarian and political transition.

TI  - Inequalities in health status among rural residents: EQ-5D findings from household survey China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB  - Introduction: This study analyzed inequalities in health status among different socioeconomic and demographic rural residents covered by the New Rural Cooperative Medical System in China.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Lian Yungang City, China. A total of 337 respondents, who were selected by using a multistage stratified systematic random sampling method, completed the surveys. A questionnaire consisting of EQ-5D and demographic and socioeconomic information was adopted for data collection, and was administered by face-to-face interviews. Multiple regression models were employed to examine the differences in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and the EQ-5D dimensions.
   Results: Compared with those with lower education attainment, the respondents with higher education levels tended to report a higher VAS score (beta = 2.666, 95% CI: 0.978 to 6.310), and were less likely to suffer from pain/discomfort (OR = 3.968; 95% CI: 1.447 to 10.880). The singles were more likely than the married to report moderate or extreme problems in usual activities (OR = 4.583; 95% CI: 1.188 to 17.676) and mobility (OR = 10.666; 95% CI: 2.464 to 6.171). However, no statistically significant differences were identified between the respondents with different income levels in the VAS score and EQ-5D dimensions.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that the singles and the people with lower education levels are high-risk groups for poorer health status in the Chinese rural population. The findings from this study warrant further investigation.

TI  - Understanding breeding preferences among small-scale cattle producers: implications for livestock improvement programmes
T2  - ANIMAL
AB  - Livestock production provides a pathway for improving livelihoods and reducing poverty in semi-arid tropical regions. However, this contribution has been affected by low livestock productivity. Most livestock programmes have also failed due to, among other things, the inability to understand the dynamics in smallholder breeding preferences. Using data from the sub-humid region in Zimbabwe, this paper sought to provide evidence on smallholder cattle breeding preferences and the implication on livestock improvement programmes. It applies the choice experiment approach to model farmer preferences for selected cattle breeding attributes. The results show three attributes that significantly affect breeding preferences. The attributes 'cow body condition score' and the 'useful life of a bull/semen' have a positive influence while 'artificial insemination/bull maintenance cost' negatively affects farmer preferences. This means farmers prefer breeding strategies which improve the nutrition of their cows, have a longer lifespan for the bull/semen and whose cost of breeding services is low. However, access to education and income affected these preferences. Education made farmers to make informed choices while higher incomes increased the propensity of investing in livestock breeding technologies. The findings also show that existing institutional arrangements in animal management and community grazing do not promote investment in livestock improvement. Thus, more attention should be given to improving animal nutritional management which includes promoting sustainable grazing schemes. There is also a need to provide affordable livestock breeding services through recruiting and training more artificial insemination service providers. Strong and effective institutions that provide incentives for collective participation are integral to any community-based livestock breeding programme. There is also a need to promote access to information and enhance farmers' knowledge and capacity in improved livestock management practices.

T2  - ASIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS
AB  - The determinants and impacts of farm household participation in collective action for irrigation management in Chhattisgarh, India, are analyzed. Wealth or land holdings are not factors affecting participation, but minority castes are disproportionately less likely to participate. Participation is found to increase sufficiency of water in the canal, but not land productivity or per capita incomes. This highlights some of the major challenges with collective action that provides greater equality in access, but insufficient incentives to participate.

TI  - Effect of a typical systemic hospital reform on inpatient expenditure for rural population: the Sanming model in China
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Considering catastrophic health expenses in rural households with hospitalised members were unproportionally high, in 2013, China developed a model of systemic reform in Sanming by adjusting payment method, pharmaceutical system, and medical services price. The reform was expected to control the excessive growth of hospital expenditures by reducing inefficiency and waste in health system or shortening the length of stay. This study analyzed the systemic reform's impact on the financial burden and length of stay for the rural population in Sanming.
   Methods: A total of 1,113,615 inpatient records for the rural population were extracted from the rural new cooperative medical scheme (NCMS) database in Sanming from 2007 to 2012 (before the reform) and from 2013 to 2016 (after the reform). We calculated the average growth rate of total inpatient expenditures and costs of different medical service categories (medications, diagnostic testing, physician services and therapeutic services) in these two periods. Generalized linear models (GLM) were employed to examine the effect of reform on out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures and length of stay, controlling for some covariates. Furthermore, we controlled the fixed effects of the year and hospitals, and included cluster standard errors by hospital to assess the robustness of the findings in the GLM analysis.
   Results: The typical systemic reform decreased the average growth rate of total inpatient expenditures by 1.34%, compared with the period before the reform. The OOP expenditures as a share of total expenditures showed a downward trend after the reform (42.34% in 2013). Holding all else constant, individuals after the reform spent (sic)308.42 less on OOP expenditures (p < 0.001) than they did before the reform. Moreover, length of stay had a decrease of 0.67 days after the reform (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: These results suggested that the typical systemic hospital reform of the Sanming model had some positive effects on cost control and reducing financial burden for the rural population. Considering the OOP expenditures as a share of total expenditures was still high, China still has a long way to go to improve the benefits rural people have enjoyed from the NCMS.

TI  - A behavioral model of landscape change in the Amazon Basin: The colonist case
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - This paper presents the prototype of a predictive model capable of describing both magnitudes of deforestation and its spatial articulation into patterns of forest fragmentation. In a departure from other landscape models, it establishes an explicit behavioral foundation for algorithm development, predicated on notions of the peasant economy and on household production theory. It takes a "bottom-up" approach, generating the process of land-cover change occurring at lot level together with the geography of a transportation system to describe regional landscape change. In other words, it translates the decentralized decisions of individual households into a collective, spatial impact. In so doing, the model unites the richness of survey research on farm households with the analytical rigor of spatial analysis enabled by geographic information systems (GIS). The paper describes earlier efforts at spatial modeling, provides a critique of the so-called spatially explicit model, and elaborates a behavioral foundation by considering farm practices of colonists in the Amazon basin. It then uses, insight from the behavioral statement to motivate a GIS-based model architecture. The model is implemented for a long-standing colonization frontier in the eastern sector of the basin, along the Trans-Amazon Highway in the State of Para, Brazil. Results are subjected to both sensitivity analysis and error assessment, and suggestions are made about how the model could be improved.

TI  - Horizontal collaborations and the competitiveness of dairy farmers in Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF CO-OPERATIVE ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The efficiency of an agricultural system depends not only on how its agents work and solve problems individually but also on how they interact with each other and with their environment. In Brazil, dairy farmers have found it difficult to remain and grow in business. To overcome market and institutional challenges, agents of the dairy production chain have developed different forms of organization and coordination. This study aimed to deter-mine whether dairy farmers who participate in horizontal organizations have greater competitiveness than those who do not. Primary data were collected from 347 dairy farms located in two important milk-producing states in Brazil, namely Parana and Sao Paulo. Competitiveness indicators were developed using factor analysis. Fourteen variables were combined into four competitiveness indicators: productive capacity (PC), institutional knowledge (IK), perception of market transactions and incentives (PMTI), and quality of milk transportation. Dairy farmers who participated in horizontal organizations had higher PC, IK, and PMTI scores than non-participants. Efficient horizontal organizations can increase the competitiveness of dairy farms.

TI  - Institutional choices between private management and user group management during forest devolution: A case study of forest allocation in China
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - China has endeavored to devolve collective forests to individual households or user groups in the past decades. However, few studies have explored the community-level institutional selection process in the forest devolution reforms. Based on a longitudinal case study in Fujian province, this study focuses on China's forest devolution reform in the early 2000s and explores in the reform why the community allocated forests to groups of households rather than to individual households, which was the method preferred by the central government. The study also investigates the factors and mechanisms that influenced these institutional choices. The analysis indicates that, when a community is empowered to play a decisive role in institutional choices, the preferences of households may differ from the decisions made by -state-level actors. Three factors are found critical to the selection of user group management in the devolution reform: the difficulty of allocating physical forests equally to individual households, the decreasing dependence of livelihoods on forests, and the development of a forest rights market. We argue that forest devolution policies should recognize the multi-functionality of rural forests, their changing roles in local economic dynamics, the complexities of existing tenure systems, and the local demand for the autonomy of defining forest rights arrangements.

TI  - Elderly hospitalization and the New-type Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) in China: multi-stage cross-sectional surveys of Jiangxi province
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Studies assessing the impacts of China's New-type Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) reform of 2003 among rural elderly have been limited.
   Method: Multistage stratified cluster sampling household surveys of 1838, 1924, 1879, 1888, 1890 and 1896 households from 27 villages in Jiangxi province were conducted in 2003/2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014. Data from older adults age 65 and above were analyzed. Weighted logistic regression was applied to find factors of elderly hospitalization services.
   Results: Since 2003, hospitalization rates for elderly increased, while rates of patients leaving against medical advice and patients avoiding the hospital decreased (P < 0.05). Factors associated with a higher likelihood of reporting hospitalization in the past year for elderly were the per-capita financial level V in 2012 for NCMS (Adjusted Odds Ratios [aOR]: 2.295), the level VI in 2014 (aOR: 3.045) versus the level I in 2003 and chronic disease (aOR: 2.089) versus not having a chronic disease. Lower rate of elderly left against medical advice was associated with the financial level V in 2012 (aOR: 0.099) versus the level I. The higher rate of hospital avoidance was associated with chronic disease status (aOR: 5.759) versus not having a chronic disease, while the lower rate was associated with the financial level VI in 2014 (aOR: 0.143) versus the level I. Among reporting reasons for elderly hospital avoidance, the cost-related reasons just dropped slightly over the years.
   Conclusions: NCMS improved access to health services for older adults. The utilization of hospitalization services for rural elderly increased gradually, but cost-related barriers remained the primary reporting barrier to accessing hospitalization services.

TI  - Indigenous adaptation to climate change risks in northern Ghana
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB  - There is growing evidence of a range of theoretical and applied Indigenous climate change adaptation strategies, yet analyses of African examples are generally focused at single local spatial scales, with limited description of how they have evolved over time. Drawing from research across three districts in northern Ghana, this study employs a mixed-methods approach and an interpretivist framework to develop understanding of how farmers are implementing Indigenous adaptation strategies in response to climate change risks at both household and community scales. Farmers are perceiving multiple climate risks such as increased temperatures, erratic rainfall and prolonged droughts, which are disrupting cropping calendars and decreasing productivity. In response to those impacts, farming households are utilising Indigenous knowledge to individually implement diverse strategies such as rainwater harvesting, relocation of farms to water sources, neem leaf extract and organic manure applications, while communities are collectively engaging in congregational prayers, rituals for rainmaking, taboos, investment in local irrigation systems and tree planting. Farmers' adaptation strategies are evolving over time, as many people are integrating Indigenous practices with modern knowledge and technologies to facilitate improvements in irrigation, organic manure application, planting drought-resistant crops, agroforestry and crop diversification. Decision-makers in local, regional and national government institutions could work to design multi-scalar adaptation interventions that support the integration of Indigenous and modern knowledge to address the complexity of climate change risks across different scales to promote sustainable livelihoods.

TI  - Vegetable intervention for livelihood and nutritional security of small landholders: key component for enhancing the income of farmers
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB  - Growing vegetable crops in Mewat poses a serious challenge due to its agro-climatology and edaphic characteristics. The main occupation of inhabitants in Mewat is agriculture and allied agro-based activities. Seeing the importance of area, an attempt was made to introduce vegetables cultivation at commercial level to increase the income of farmers and improve their livelihood condition. The introduction of crops, like tomato, brinjal and bottlegourd in Mewat has enhanced the farmer's income significantly and it has attained commercial status. Though income and yield enhancement was recoded at every farmer's level but some farmers who were mainly landless and practicing vegetable farming on rented land could increase their profit to a record level in a period of 3 years from 2011 to 2013. On an average basis in tomato, brinjal and bottlegourd, the yield increased up to 58%, 44% and 82% and profitability up to 49%, 48% and 55% respectively. If other interventions like, drip irrigation, Integrated Pest and Nutrient Management (IPM and INM), polyhouse cultivation, off-season nursery and vegetable production, efficient post-harvest handling with cool chain facilities, value addition and processing, contract farming etc. are added, the income and profitability may increase many folds. On over all basis, bottlegourd variety Pusa Naveen, brinjal variety Pusa Uttam and tomato hybrids Heemsohna and US 2853 were most demanding and fetched higher prices due to their high yield and fruit quality attributes. Therefore, it was proved that vegetable production is the emerging sector in agricultural diversification that would augment income of smallholders and generate employment opportunities in rural areas.

TI  - Constraints to Women Farmers' Entrepreneurial Development in Nasarawa State, Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION
AB  - This study examined the entrepreneurial competencies among women farmers in Nasarawa State, Nigeria. Specifically, this paper described the characteristics of the respondents, identified the characteristics (type, form and duration) of enterprises the respondents engaged in, and examined their constraints to entrepreneurial development. Structured interview schedule was used to collect relevant information from 165 women farmers selected through multi-stage sampling procedure across 6 local government areas of Nasarawa State. Descriptive statistics (percentages and mean) were used to analyze the data. Most (82.8%) of the women entrepreneur were married, and had less than secondary education (82.3%). Also the mean age, household size and annual income was 39, 8 and. 208,759.38 respectively. Furthermore, the majority (81%) did not belong to their respective business associations. Processing was the major type of business engaged in by many (58.8%) as sole proprietor (87.9%). Persistence, commitment to work contract, and risk-taking ranked highest with a mean score of 2.55, 2.47 and 2.40, respectively among the women entrepreneurial characteristics. Lack of start-up capital (95%), poor infrastructural facilities (93%), and inadequate access to relevant information (89%) were the major constraints to women farmers' entrepreneurial development. Various tiers of government should create the enabling social and physical infrastructure environments to catalyze entrepreneurial development (with special focus for women) in the rural areas.

TI  - The impact of contracts on organic honey producers' incomes in southwestern Ethiopia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - In southwestern Ethiopia honey is a non-timber forest product that provides income for many smallholders. Some of these beekeepers supply their honey under contract to a company that markets their organic honey internationally allowing them to access premium markets. Since both production and marketing depend crucially on the forest, both smallholders and the company have an interest in preserving the forest. An important question is whether smallholders also benefit economically from supplying under contract. The objective of this study is to examine the contribution of participation in contract supply of organic honey to beekeepers' income levels in the Sheka zone in southwestern Ethiopia. Results indicate that contract supply improved quality of honey delivered, the prices beekeepers received, and total honey income per household. The findings illustrate the potential of contract supply of forest product for sustainable management of forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Implementing large-scale food fortification in Ghana: Lessons learned
T2  - FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN
AB  - Background. Food fortification began in Ghana in 1996 when legislation was passed to enforce the iodization of salt. This paper describes the development of the Ghanaian fortification program and identifies lessons learned in implementing fortification initiatives (universal salt iodization, fortification of vegetable oil and wheat flour) from 1996 to date.
   Objective. This paper identifies achievements, challenges, and lessons learned in implementing large scale food fortification in Ghana.
   Methodology. Primary data was collected through interviews with key members of the National Food Fortification Alliance (NFFA), implementation staff of the Food Fortification Project, and staff of GAIN. Secondary data was collected through desk review of documentation from the project offices of the National Food Fortification Project and the National Secretariat for the Implementation of the National Salt Iodization in Ghana.
   Results. Reduction of the prevalence of goiter has been observed, and coverage of households with adequately iodized salt increased between 1996 and 2006. Two models were designed to increase production of adequately iodized salt: one to procure and distribute potassium iodate (KIO3) locally, and the second, the salt bank cooperative (SBC) model, specifically designed for small-scale artisanal salt farmers. This resulted in the establishment of a centralized potassium iodate procurement and distribution system, tailored to local needs and ensuring competitive and stable prices. The SBC model allowed for nearly 157 MT of adequately iodized salt to be produced in 2011 in a region where adequately iodized salt was initially not available. For vegetable oil fortification, implementing quantitative analysis methods for accurate control of added fortificant proved challenging but was overcome with the use of a rapid test device, confirming that 95% of vegetable oil is adequately fortified in Ghana. However, appropriate compliance with national standards on wheat flour continues to pose challenges due to adverse sensory effects, which have led producers to reduce the dosage of premix in wheat flour.
   Conclusions. Challenges to access to premix experienced by small producers can be overcome with a central procurement model in which the distributor leverages the overall volume by tendering for a consolidated order. The SBC model has the potential to be expanded and to considerably increase the coverage of the population consuming iodized salt in Ghana. Successful implementation of the cost-effective iCheck CHROMA rapid test device should be replicated in other countries where quality control of fortified vegetable oil is a challenge, and extended to additional food vehicles, such as wheat flour and salt. Only a reduced impact on iron deficiency in Ghana can be expected, given the low level of fortificant added to the wheat flour. An integrated approach, with complementary programs including additional iron-fortified food vehicles, should be explored to maximize health impact.

TI  - Norms in Community-Based Organic Farming
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - In integrated organic farming, smallholder farmers tend to work collectively in a group with the norms that bind their behaviours. This study aims to explore norms among the farmers with the case of organic rice farming in Ketapang Village, Susukan Sub district, Semarang, Indonesia. The study employed the qualitative case study method and applied Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development framework. The norms among these farmers included only planting local varieties, using natural pest repellent, jointly cultivating the land, fairness in water distribution and prioritising rice consumption for farming families rather than profiting from the sale of rice products.

TI  - Smallholder Coffee Productivity as Affected by Socioeconomic Factors and Technology Adoption
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB  - Despite the increase in area under coffee in Kenya in the last decade, productivity has been on the decline. Numerous production technologies have been developed through on-station research but there has been limited on-farm research to assess the impact of these technologies at the farm level. On the other hand, smallholder farmers are endowed differently and this would positively or negatively affect the adoption of recommended technologies and hence coffee productivity. This study was carried out to evaluate the effects of socioeconomic factors and technology adoption on smallholder coffee productivity at the farm level. The study employed stratified random sampling where 376 farmers were randomly sampled from six cooperative societies which had been preselected using probability proportional to the size sampling technique. The effects of socioeconomic factors and technology adoption on coffee productivity were analyzed using the stochastic Cobb-Douglas production function. The study revealed that off-farm income, access to credit, type of land tenure, and land size had significant positive effects on coffee productivity. Therefore, coffee farmers should be encouraged to diversify their income sources and to embrace credit financing, as the government reviews land use policies to avail adequate agricultural land. The study further revealed that the adoption of recommended application rates of manure, fungicides, and pesticides had significant positive effects on coffee productivity. The adoption of these technologies should therefore be enhanced among small-scale farmers to improve coffee productivity at the farm level.

TI  - Drought, Farm Output and Heterogeneity: Evidence from Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH ASIAN DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This article studies the impact of canal water use and communal ethnic heterogeneity on farm output during droughts. Categorizing villages where only one language is spoken as homogenous, and using a dummy variable that takes a value of one for households that use both tube-well and canal water and is zero for those that rely solely on canal water, this article performs a least squares analysis. The data are the 2001-2002 round of the Pakistan Panel Household Survey (PPHS), which was conducted during one of the worst droughts in Pakistan's history. The main results of this article show that the negative effect of drought increases in the proportion of households affected in the village. Moreover, farms that have diversified irrigation are better off compared to those relying only on canal water, especially when residing in ethnically heterogeneous villages. The article concludes with policy prescriptions based on the interplay of common water resources, ethnic heterogeneity and water management.

TI  - The demonstration effect of transactions between strangers on those between acquaintances: evidence from land rentals in rural China
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - Over the last decade, introducing outer village lessees has been an important approach to increasing the marketization of land rentals in rural China. However, with large numbers of informal features among acquaintances, the effect of introducing outer village lessees is ambiguous. In this paper, data from the 2015 China Household Finance Survey are used to analyse the demonstration effect of land rentals between strangers on those between acquaintances, and land rent is used to represent the marketization of land rentals. The estimated results indicate that with the emergence of outer village lessees, lessors transacting with acquaintances are more likely to obtain high land rents and to rent out farmland for profit. Evidence shows that profit motives are the key pathway by which the presence of outer village lessees affects land rents. The analysis using the sample of lessees supports our findings. Our analysis implies that the demonstration effect exists in land rental markets, and also provides a feasible instrument for promoting market-oriented land rentals between acquaintances.

TI  - The impact of medical service on the return behavior: A city-level study in China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Due to the constraints of the rural-urban household registration systems, the migrants of China currently receive varying degrees of medical services. The fact that many migrants choose to return to their hometowns due to the inequality in medical care has been a social phenomenon. Using data from the 2017 China Migrant Dynamic Survey (CMDS), this paper explores the effect of medical services on population migration. Probit regression analysis method was utilized to examine the relationship between medical service level (MSL) and medical service improvement (MSI) and return behavior (RB), as well as the interaction effect between MSL and MSI, and the moderating effect of health status (HS) and health education (HE). Multiple heterogeneity tests were performed. Grouping regressions were conducted using rural household registration (RHR), grouping regressions were conducted using new rural cooperative medical system (NRCMS), and multinomial Probit regressions were conducted using migration distance and age factors. The following findings were obtained. First, when MSL is low but MSI is high in the locality of household registration, the return probability of migrants will increase. MSL also has a positive interaction effect with MSI, and they jointly increase the return probability of migrants; Second, HS and HE have a positive moderating effect on the relationships between MSL and RB and between MSI and RB; Third, heterogeneity analysis indicates that the migrants with RHR or the migrants not covered by the NRCMS are more prone to return due to the reason of medical service. In addition, the analysis also shows that middle-aged and older people who return across provinces have the highest tendency to return due to medical services and young people have the lowest propensity to return across and within provinces. The study could help local governments change their public medical care policies and close the gap between medical services in different areas. As a result, it is necessary to understand population migration trends and promote New Urbanization Strategies.

TI  - Social and financial incentives for overcoming a collective action problem
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - Addressing public health externalities often requires community-level collective action. Due to social norms, each person's sanitation investment decisions may depend on the decisions of neighbors. We report on a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted with 19,000 households in rural Bangladesh where we grouped neighboring households and introduced (either financial or social recognition) rewards with a joint liability component for the group, or asked each group member to make a private or public pledge to maintain a hygienic latrine. The group financial reward has the strongest impact in the short term (3 months), inducing a 7.5-12.5 percentage point increase in hygienic latrine ownership, but this effect dissipates in the medium term (15 months). In contrast, the public commitment induced a 4.2-6.3 percentage point increase in hygienic latrine ownership in the short term, but this effect persists in the medium term. Non-financial social recognition or a private pledge has no detectable effect on sanitation investments.

TI  - Partial credit guarantee and financial additionality for smallholders coffee cooperatives: experience from Ethiopia
T2  - DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE
AB  - This study examined the effects of a partial credit guarantee in increasing lending to credit constrained farmer cooperatives under the Ethiopian context. The data were generated through questionnaire survey, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and from banks' and cooperatives' records. The scheme improved financial additionality among the targeted cooperatives, but it had limited reach and impacts on terms and conditions of loans. Factors related to borrower cooperatives, lending banks, scheme design and operation, regulatory and business environments affect its effectiveness. This calls for broader interventions that enable loan guarantees to be effectively utilised and generate the desired outcomes.

TI  - The impact of cooperative membership on family farms' income: evidence from China
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - Family farms and agricultural cooperatives play important roles in modern agriculture in many countries. Different from smallholder farms in scale, family farms have been designated as the predominant unit of farming in China in the recent decade. However, studies on the relationship between cooperatives and family farms' income have been less frequent. Using survey data of 769 planting family farms in China, and employing the endogenous switching regression model, we examine the impact of cooperative membership on family farms' operating income (including total and per capita income). The empirical results show that, after controlling for the selection bias, cooperative membership exerts a positive and significant impact on family farms' income. And the income increase of non-member family farms if they had participated in cooperatives is much higher than that of family farms who are already members of cooperatives. Moreover, family farms that are common members of cooperatives, obtaining more centralized services and engaging in grain crop farming, would benefit more from cooperative membership. Technology-related service, marketing and information are critical pathways via which cooperative membership would increase family farms' income.

TI  - The development and disintegration of a Classic Maya center and its climate context
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Research in Southern Belize has produced a 1000-year record of coupled human and environmental relationships at the ancient Maya city Uxbenka. Located at the southeastern margin of the Maya Lowlands, this region has excellent agricultural land and some of the highest rainfall in the Maya region. Uxbenka was the founding political center in southern Belize after 100 BCE. After 850 years, Uxbenka experienced a long geopolitical disintegration ending in depopulation as part of broad regional collapse. We use kernel density and summed probability distributions of 167 high-precision AMS C-14 dates to reconstruct relative changes in population and investments in the built environment throughout the growth and decline of the polity. Those data are compared to an annually resolved speleothem paleoclimate record from Yok Balum cave, located less than 3 km from Uxbenka's civic ceremonial core. With no Classic Period wetland fields or evidence for large-scale landscape investments in agricultural intensification, food production would have been rainfall dependent as was water availability for household use. Using a 30 m SRTM DEM, we compute flow accumulation and the upvalley extents of river networks while varying the input precipitation to reflect hypothesized changes in paleorainfall over time. Our data suggest that Uxbenka experienced rapid growth following a severe drought at 200 CE, as well as cycles of growth and contraction until just after 750 CE. We find that geopolitical disintegration in southern Belize was already underway when a severe drought began at 830 CE. That six-decade drought likely contributed to the abandonment of Uxbenka and limited geopolitical reorganization.

TI  - Off-grid energy services for the poor: Introducing LED lighting in the Millennium Villages Project in Malawi
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Lanterns that use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) powered by batteries, which are in turn charged by grid electricity or small solar panels, have emerged as a cost-competitive alternative to kerosene and other fuel-based lighting technologies, offering brighter light for longer duration at equal or lower cost over time. This paper presents lessons learned from the introduction of solar LED lanterns in rural Malawi. We discuss a market-based program using new and existing local commercial structures such as vendors and cooperatives to sell lanterns to village households without subsidy. The paper addresses issues of enterprise development, community interactions, and survey data on lighting use and expenditure patterns before and after LED lantern introduction. Households that purchased a lantern reported high levels of satisfaction with the LED lanterns as well as savings in annual kerosene expenditure comparable to the price of the lantern. These households also reported monthly incomes comparable to the price of the LED lanterns whereas non-adopters surveyed reported monthly incomes about half this level, suggesting a need for financing options to maximize adoption among poorer populations in rural areas. These results suggest that similar market based models of LED lighting technology dissemination have the potential to be replicated and scaled up in other off-grid regions in developing countries. However, viability of local cooperatives and supply chains for lantern products over the medium-to-long term remain to be assessed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - FairTrade's theory of change: an evaluation based on the cooperative life cycle framework and mixed methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS
AB  - This study presents a quasi-experimental analysis of the impact of FairTrade certification on the commercial performance of coffee farmers in Tanzania. In doing so the study emphasises the importance of a well-contextualised theory of change as a basis for evaluation design. It also stresses the value of qualitative methods to control for selection bias. Based on a longitudinal (pseudo-panel) dataset comprising both certified and conventional farmers, it shows that FairTrade certification introduced a disincentive to farmers' commercialisation. We explain this counterintuitive conclusion on the basis of the `cooperative life cycle' theory developed by US agribusiness scholars.

TI  - Competing use of organic resources, village-level interactions between farm types and climate variability in a communal area of NE Zimbabwe
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - In communal areas of NE Zimbabwe, feed resources are collectively managed, with herds grazing on grasslands during the rainy season and mainly on crop residues during the dry season, which creates interactions between farmers and competition for organic resources. Addition of crop residues or animal manure is needed to sustain agricultural production on inherently poor soils. Objectives of this study were to assess the effect of village-level interactions on carbon and nutrient flows, and to explore their impact on the long-term productivity of different farm types under climate variability. Crop and cattle management data collected in Murewa Communal area, NE Zimbabwe was used together with a dynamic farm-scale simulation model (NUANCES-FARMSIM) to simulate village-level interactions. Simulations showed that grasslands support most cattle feed intake (c. 75%), and that crop residues produced by non-cattle farmers sustain about 30% of the dry season feed intake. Removal of crop residues (0.3-0.4 t C ha(-1) yr(-1)) from fields of non-cattle farmers resulted in a long-term decrease in crop yields. No-access to crop residues of non-cattle farmers increased soil C modestly and improved yields in the long-term, but not enough to meet household energy requirements. Harvest of grain and removal of most crop residues by grazing cattle caused a long-term decline in soil C stocks for all farm types. The smallest decrease (-0.5 t C ha(-1)) was observed for most fertile fields of cattle farmers, who manure their fields. Cattle farmers needed to access 4-10 ha of grassland to apply 3 t of manure ha(-1) yr(-1). Rainfall variability intensifies crop-livestock interactions increasing competition for biomass to feed livestock (short-term effect) or to rehabilitate soils (long-term effect). Prolonged dry seasons and low availability of crop residues may lead to cattle losses, with negative impact in turn on availability of draught power, affecting area under cultivation in consecutive seasons until farmers re-stock. Increasing mineral fertiliser use concurrently with keeping crop residues in fertile fields and allocating manure to poor fields appears to be a promising strategy to boost crop and cattle productivity at village level. The likelihood of this scenario being implemented depends on availability of fertilisers and decision of farmers to invest in rehabilitating soils to obtain benefits in the long-term. Adaptation options cannot be blind to what occurs beyond field and farm level, because otherwise recommendations from research and development do not fit the local conditions and farmers tend to ignore them.

TI  - The plight of female agricultural wageworkers in Morocco during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB  - While vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 were launched worldwide, a drama has been unfolding in the Moroccan countryside. It has been marked, over the last couple of decades, by rapid agrarian transformation, manifestations of which have included expanding irrigation frontiers and the increasing growth of high-value crops. These dynamics rely strongly on female agricultural wageworkers. Although they earn low wages, their income is crucial and is used to care for loved ones by paying for school fees, rent, electricity, and medicines. These workers, therefore, cannot afford to quit their jobs. However, most female wageworkers in Morocco are employed without a contract or social security cover. While working in an informal environment and living already in a precarious situation, little is known about how the pandemic has affected them. In this article, we seek to supply some of this information by drawing on the authors' commitment over almost a decade of covering female wage-workers' experiences in different agricultural regions in Morocco. Additionally, since March 2020, we have conducted 30 phone interviews with female laborers and farmers in the Saiss and in the coastal area of the Gharb and Loukkos. Using the pandemic as a focus, our results illustrate the inherent contradictions upon which Morocco's agricultural boom has been founded. Although many female laborers are de facto heads of household or contribute in fundamental ways to the household income, they continue to be considered as secondary earners or as housewives, leading to low structural wages. Moreover, these women assume the prime responsibility for all domestic tasks, which are not economically recognized or valued. Consequently, they face new challenges in addition to their already precarious situations. Reduced work opportunities and limited state support have led to financial and psychological hardship which jeopardize their own and their family's survival.

TI  - Green Remittances: A novel form of sustainability finance
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Lack of finance is a key barrier to sustainable development. Formal aid and private investment are insufficient and vulnerable to inefficient government-to-government interactions and fail to reach some populations. Re-mittances from 280 million migrant workers to families at home represent enormous complementary monetary inflows to low-and middle-income countries, and, at $600 billion globally, are three-times greater than "top-down" Official Development Assistance. While commonly intended to alleviate poverty, remittances are rarely targeted towards sustainable development, and can even lead to environmental degradation. There is significant potential to align remittances with sustainability goals, assisted by emerging technologies and digital-finance platforms. Proactive "green remittances" can take the form of cash, goods, or services. They can be targeted to households, transportation, agriculture, entrepreneurial purposes, or community-level infrastructure projects. Applications include renewable energy, energy-efficiency, and a range of climate change resilience and adap-tation activities. The article provides a unique synthesis of the existing literature, highlighting the lack of focus on proactively directing remittances toward sustainability, and identifies and assesses early targeting efforts in eight countries. Key policy challenges include awareness-building among remittance providers and recipients, identifying and pooling applicable locally-available goods and services, assuring quality, reducing transaction costs, and scale-up.

TI  - Impacts of sustainability certification on farm income: Evidence from small-scale specialty green tea farmers in Vietnam
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Sustainability certification for small-scale farms has gained considerable momentum in developing countries. However, evidence on the economic benefits of certification schemes in the context of domestically consumed foods and beverages is scarce. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating the impacts of sustainability standards on the selling prices, sales, costs and net income of small-scale specialty green tea farming in Vietnam. We analyze original survey data on 401 smallholder green tea farmers and employ propensity score matching to mitigate self-selection bias. Our estimates reveal that certified green tea producers are able to obtain a higher average selling price and sales value. In addition, although certification leads to a dramatic increase in the costs of hired labor, net farm income is still significantly improved.

TI  - China's sloping land conversion program: Institutional innovation or business as usual?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - China's Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) is the largest land retirement/reforestation program in the developing world, having the goal of converting 14.67 million hectares of cropland to forests by 2010 (4.4 million of which is on land with slopes greater than 25 degrees) and an additional "soft" goal of afforesting a roughly equal area of wasteland by 2010. Pending successful completion it could represent a 10-20% increase in China's national forest area and a 10% decrease in current cultivated area. In contrast to China's other forest-sector policies, SLCP uses a public payment scheme that directly engages millions of rural households as core agents of project implementation, and has the stated principals of volunteerism. Thus, insofar as current or future de facto program implementation involves decentralized, voluntary grassroots participation, SLCP represents an important departure from "business as usual" in how China manages its forest resources. This work draws upon current available research of the program and uses a 2003 household and village-level survey conducted by the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy, CAS, to examine program design, implementation and outcomes to date. Results indicate that significant problems in design and implementation exist, with these including shortfalls in subsidies delivered, lack of respect of the principals of volunteerism, and insufficient technical support and budgeting for local implementation costs. More fundamentally, some program goals appear to be based on common misperceptions regarding the linkages between forests and watershed services. Overall, SLCP contains both innovative elements (volunteerism and the direct engagement of farmers) as well as components that hark back to policies and mindsets of decades past (the program's top-down, simplified contract structure, lack of sufficient consultation with local communities and rural households, and campaign-style mobilization). The paper concludes by providing four main suggestions to improve the program: 1) Increase local community input in design and implementation, and ensure that households have full autonomy in participation choice; 2) improve technical support and budgeting for local administrative costs and capacity building; 3) clarify the environmental services targeted and verify the measures needed to acquire these services; and 4) integrate SLCP into an overall package of complementary policies aimed at the rural sector.

TI  - Discrepancies between self-reported tick bites and evidence of tick-borne disease exposure among nomadic Mongolian herders
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Twenty-six per cent of Mongolians live pastoral lifestyles, increasing their likelihood of exposure to ticks and placing them at a higher risk for contracting tick-borne diseases (TBDs). Anaplasma spp. and Rickettsia spp. have been identified in ticks, livestock and humans in Mongolia, but no known qualitative research has been conducted investigating the association between nomadic herder characteristics, tick bite history and exposure to TBDs. To better understand the association between self-reported tick bites and symptoms versus actual exposure to TBDs, this study paired serological data with 335 surveys administered to Mongolian herders, ages 12-69, from 2014 to 2015. Logistic regression results identified no significant associations between reported tick bites or symptoms with serological evidence of Anaplasma spp. and Rickettsia spp. controlling for age, gender and aimag. Among the 335 respondents who were seropositive to either Anaplasma spp. or Rickettsia spp., 32.9% self-reported experiencing abnormal symptoms such as redness, inflammation, headache, arthritis or fever after being bitten. Alternatively, 17.3% (58/335) of individuals reported experiencing symptoms following a tick bite in instances where serological results indicated no exposure to Anaplasma spp. or Rickettsia spp. Results also identified inconsistencies in reporting and seroprevalence among different age groups, with children having the highest reporting and treatment seeking rates but low levels of exposure in comparison with other groups. While survey results showed that individuals were aware of peak tick seasons and tick species that inhabit specific areas, 58% of heads of households (49/84) were unaware that ticks can cause disease in livestock or dogs. This study suggests that herders are an at-risk population in Mongolia with gaps in awareness of TBD risk. Increased surveillance paired with focused outreach to prevent TBDs targeted to the herder population is encouraged.

TI  - Contract farming scheme for rubber production in Western region of Ghana: why do farmers side sell?
T2  - FORESTS TREES AND LIVELIHOODS
AB  - Contract farming guarantees smallholder farmers a reliable market, allow them to access inputs and technical support, and thus improve their welfare. However, side selling is a major threat to the promotion and development of contract farming in Sub-Saharan Africa, including in Ghana. While there is growing interest in addressing this issue for food crops and other tree crops, particularly coffee, there is limited literature on this subject for rubber. Against this background, our paper contributes to filling this knowledge gap by answering the research question "Why do smallholder farmers engage in side selling?" using primary data from 370 rubber farmers participating in an outgrower scheme in Western region of Ghana. A binary Probit regression model is applied in the empirical analysis. We find that 20% of the rubber farmers engaged in contract farming are involved in side selling. The results show that contractor's delays in payment, delays in weighing latex and farmers' difficulty in getting truck to transport latex to sale point are positively correlated with side selling behaviour while farmers' age and access to extension services decrease their likelihood of engaging in side selling. To curb side selling behaviour among rubber farmers, it is important that the contractor addresses the transaction related challenges faced by farmers.

TI  - No quick fixes: four interacting constraints to advancing agroecology in Uganda
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - A century after its inception, agroecology has entered mainstream development debates as a more sustainable alternative to conventional agricultural modernization of relevance not least for improving smallholder agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. Agroecology is a broad concept considered to have transformative potential, yet as a research field it has often been technology-centred and focused at the local level. Building on the experiences of Ugandan agroecologists working in an array of agricultural professions throughout the country, this paper identifies and discusses major barriers to agroecology in Uganda. Inductive analysis of qualitative data from interviews and focus groups generated four types of interacting barriers; constraints at farmer level, an agricultural knowledge system favouring conventional approaches, adverse and intertwined political and economic interests, and cross-cutting ideological and discursive pressures. These broad challenges become manifest in the accounts presented, making clear that barriers to and therefore also appropriate strategies for advancing agroecology must be treated as contextual even if a global movement' is emerging around it. The discussion suggests theoretical lenses for further inquiry into agroecology and its realization in light of these constraints.

TI  - Would Kazakh Citizens Support a Milk Co-Operative System?
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - We estimate the monetary value of a policy aimed at increasing rural co-operative production in Kazakhstan to increase milk production. We analyse the drivers associated with public support for such policy using the contingent valuation method. The role of individuals' psychological aspects, based on the reasoned action approach, along with individuals' views on the country's past regime (i.e., to the former Soviet Union), their awareness about the governmental policy, their sociodemographic characteristics, and household location on their willingness to pay (WTP) for the policy is analysed using an interval regression model. Additionally, we examine changes in individuals' WTP before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimated total economic value of the policy is KZT 1335 bn for the length of the program at KZT 267 bn per year, which is approximately half the total program budget, which includes other interventions beyond the creation of production co-operatives. The total economic value of the policy would equal the cost of the whole program after 10 years, indicating public support for this policy amongst Kazakh citizens. Psychological factors, i.e., attitude, perceived social pressure, and perceived behavioural control, and the respondents' awareness of the policy and views on the Soviet Union regime are associated with their WTP. Sociodemographic factors, namely, age, income, and education, are also statistically significant. Finally, the effect of the shocks of COVID-19 is negatively associated with the respondents' WTP.

TI  - Mobile phones and wrong numbers: how Maasai agro-pastoralists form and use accidental social ties in East Africa
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Mobile phones are recognized as important new tools for rural development in the Global South, but few studies have examined how phones can shape social networks. This study documents a new type of social tie, enabled by mobile phones, that to our knowledge has not previously been discussed in academic literature. In 2018, we discovered that Maasai pastoralists in northern Tanzania create new social ties through wrong numbers, a phenomenon with implications for theory on social networks and path dependency. We used a mixed ethnographic and survey-based design to examine the following: (1) the conditions under which wrong number connections (WNCs) are made; (2) the incidence of these connections in the study area; and (3) the association between WNCs and multiple livelihood strategies. Working in 10 rural communities in Tanzania, we conducted 16 group interviews with men about their phone use and found that WNCs are diverse and can provide households with important information, resources, and opportunities from an expansive geographic area. (Nine separate interviews with groups of women revealed that women do not create WNCs.) Based on early qualitative findings, we designed and conducted a standardized survey with 317 household heads. We found that 46% of respondents have had WNCs. Furthermore, multivariate regression models show a significant association between WNCs and the controversial practice of leasing land in one district. Taken together, our findings show that WNCs can be seen as innovations in social networking that reduce path dependency, increase the range of potential outcomes, and hold important implications for rural livelihoods in East Africa.

TI  - THE INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF HEIGHT: EVIDENCE FROM RURAL VIETNAM
T2  - HEALTH ECONOMICS
AB  - A growing body of work suggests that health may be transferred across generations. The aim of this paper is to examine the mechanisms that might account for observed intergenerational associations in health outcomes. Using data from Vietnam, this study analyzes intergenerational correlations in height, a measure of long-run health status, between parents and their children. Insights from biology and economics are used to motivate several strategies that collectively provide insight on the role and importance of different mechanisms. The results illustrate strong intergenerational associations in height, which remain stable with the inclusion of controls for parent and household characteristics. Maternal height is more strongly associated with the heights of boys than girls, while the associations with paternal height are similar across genders. The use of conditions faced by parents early in life as instruments for their height yields significantly larger estimates of the mother-child height association relative to OLS, while the estimated father-child associations move to zero. These results, in conjunction with those from several other tests, illustrate that non-genetic factors are important in determining parent-child associations in height, and more speculatively, that epigenetic mechanisms may play an important role. These findings illustrate the value of investments in early childhood, as these may confer intergenerational benefits. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Will China's Cooperative Medical System fail again? Insight from farmer satisfaction survey
T2  - HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
AB  - This paper studied the sustainability of China's New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NCMS) by evaluating the satisfaction rate of its participants-the farmers. The study related the overall satisfaction of the farmers to their satisfaction with the four different aspects of the program. It also identified which personal and program attributes affect the farmers' satisfaction rate. Survey data of 1278 households from 66 counties in Shandong Province of China were collected in 2011 using a multi-stage stratified cluster-sampling method. To overcome the nepotistic barriers in rural China, field surveys in each township were conducted by university students from the same place. Data were analyzed using multiple regressions and structural equation modeling method. The results showed that 86% of the farmers were either satisfied or very satisfied with the NCMS and 82% indicated their intention to continue participating in the program. Aside from its financial benefits, both the publicity and reimbursement procedure of the program were found to be significant factors in influencing the satisfaction of the farmers. Majority of the participants held positive opinions toward the NCMS, contradicting the negative assessments made by many previous studies. Given the high proportion of farmers willing to continue with the program, it is likely to be sustainable in the near future. Greater publicity and education efforts should be made to make the farmers better informed about the program, and measures should be taken to improve its reimbursement procedure and the setting of the premium level.

TI  - The Impact of Fair Trade on Smallholders' Capacity to Adapt to Climate Change
T2  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The aim of this paper is to assess to what extent producers' participation in fair trade can increase their adaptive capacity and make them more resilient to climate change. Based on the adaptation deficit framework of Fankhauser and McDermott (2014) and an expert interview with 39 producer organizations from Latin America, Asia and Africa, we first determine the perception and the impacts of climate change on fair trade producers' organizations. We then analyze how fair trade is helping producers to increase their adaptive capacity. Our results suggest that fair trade affects the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers in developing countries in two ways. First, it can work as a growth policy and affects the disposable income, which is then partly spent on adaptation measures. Second, by increased knowledge exchange, a higher degree of social capital and a better access to the international community, it makes the supply of adaptation more efficient.

TI  - Costs, contracts and the narrative of prosperity: an economic analysis of smallholder tobacco farming livelihoods in Kenya
T2  - TOBACCO CONTROL
AB  - Background The tobacco industry has used the alleged negative impacts on economic livelihoods for tobacco farmers as a narrative to oppose tobacco control measures in low/middle-income countries. However, rigorous empirical evidence to support or refute this claim remains scarce. Accordingly, we assess how much money households earn from selling tobacco, and the costs they incur to produce the crop, including labour inputs. We also evaluate farmers' decision to operate under contract directly with tobacco manufacturers and tobacco leaf-buying companies or to operate as independent farmers.
   Methods A stratified random sampling method was used to implement a nationally representative household-level economic survey of 585 farmers across the three main tobacco growing regions in Kenya. The survey was augmented with focus group discussions in all three regions to refine and enrich the context of the findings.
   Results Both contract and independent farmers experience small profit margins per acre, with contract farmers operating at a loss. Even when family labour is excluded from the calculation, income levels remain low, particularly considering the typically large households. Generally, tobacco farmers enter into contracts with tobacco companies because they have a ' guaranteed' buyer for their tobacco leaf and receive the necessary agricultural inputs (fertiliser, seeds, herbicides and so on) without paying cash up-front.
   Conclusions Tobacco farming households enter into contract with tobacco companies to realise perceived economic benefits. The narrative that tobacco farming is a lucrative economic undertaking for smallholder farmers, however, is inaccurate in the context of Kenya.

TI  - Envisioning the Future of Mosaic Landscapes: Actor Perceptions in a Mixed Cocoa/Oil-Palm Area in Ghana
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The future and benefits of mosaic landscapes have been a source of scientific and societal concern due to increasing population growth, climate change, urbanization, and expanding agricultural commodities. There is a growing call for integrated landscape approaches in which landscape actors discuss trade-offs between different land uses with a view to reaching a negotiated decision on the allocation of land uses. Yet, the operationalization of such approaches is still in its infancy, and integrated methodologies to visualize actors' landscape visions are still scarce. This study therefore presents a participatory spatial scenario-building methodology that uncovers local perceptions of landscape dynamics and needed actions in a mixed cocoa-oil-palm landscape in Ghana's Eastern Region. The methodology visualizes landscape actors' perceived plausible changes and desired future landscapes, and is designed to trigger discussions on actions needed to achieve these desired futures. Findings show that farmers and institutional actors are aware of their landscapes with future preferences coming close to actual landscape composition and spatial configuration, and that-contrary to common assumptions-only those in the oil-palm-dominated landscape who already experienced the drawbacks of increasing landscape homogenization desire a mosaic landscape. The paper concludes that the collective mapping process makes actors aware of challenges at landscape level and increases farmers' negotiation power through active engagement in the process and visualization of their knowledge and visions. Application of the methodology requires dedicated funding, political will, and capacity to apply it as an ongoing process, as well as monitoring feedback loops.

TI  - Insecure Land Rights and Share Tenancy: Evidence from Madagascar
T2  - LAND ECONOMICS
AB  - Most studies of tenurial insecurity focus on its effects on investment. This paper studies the hitherto unexplored relationship between tenurial insecurity and land tenancy contracts. Based on distinct features of formal law and customary rights in Madagascar, this paper augments the canonical model of sharecropping by making the strength of the landlord's property right increasing in the amount of risk she bears within the contract. Using data on landlords' subjective perceptions in rural Madagascar, empirical tests support the hypothesis that insecure property rights drive contract choice but offer little support in favor of the canonical risk sharing hypothesis.

TI  - Livestock depredation by large predators and its implications for conservation and livelihoods in the Karakoram Mountains of Pakistan
T2  - ORYX
AB  - Livestock depredation has particular significance in pastoral societies across the Himalayas. The dynamics of depredation by the snow leopard Panthera uncia and wolf Canis lupus were investigated by means of household surveys in the Hushey Valley, in the Karakoram Mountains of Pakistan. During 2008-2012% of the households in the valley lost livestock to snow leopards and wolves, accounting for 0.8 animals per household per year. The cost of depredation per household was equivalent to PKR 9,853 (USD 101), or 10 % of the mean annual cash income. The majority (41%) of predation incidents occurred in summer pastures, predominantly at night in open spaces. Of the total number of predation incidents, 60% were attributed to snow leopards and 37% to wolves; in 3% of cases the predator was unknown. As an immediate response to predation the majority of the local people (64%, n = 99) opted to report the case to their Village Conservation Committee for compensation and only 1% preferred to kill the predator; 32% did not respond to predation incidents. The perceived causes of predation were poor guarding (77%), reduction in wild prey (13%), and livestock being the favourite food of predators (10%). The most preferred strategies for predator management, according to the respondents, were enhanced guarding of livestock (72%), followed by increasing the availability of wild prey (18%), and lethal control (18%). Livestock depredation causing economic loss may lead to retaliatory killing of threatened predators. For carnivore conservation and livestock security in this area we recommend improved livestock guarding through collective hiring of skilled shepherds and the use of guard dogs.

TI  - Comparative analysis on environmental and economic performance of agricultural cooperatives and smallholder farmers: The case of grape production in Hebei, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Agricultural modernization and intensification have been regarded as a significant way to support agricultural development and improve farm income in China. Agricultural cooperatives have played an important role in promoting the modernization and intensification of Chinese agricultural sector. Given the increasing concerns about environmental harm, however, it still remains unclear whether and the extent to which agricultural cooperatives contributes to reducing environmental impacts of agricultural production. Hence, this study performed an environmental evaluation using life cycle assessment for three different organization forms of grape production in Changli County, Hebei Province, China: smallholder farmers, farmer-owned cooperatives and investor-owned firm-led cooperatives. Then the results of life cycle assessment were monetarized and cost benefit analysis was used to evaluate the economic performance of these three organization forms of grape production. The results demonstrate that investor-owned firm-led cooperatives present an overall improvement in environmental and economic performance with the lowest weighted environmental index (integrating all impact categories into a single score), the highest net profit and the highest total net benefit. The results also show a difference in potential improvement in environmental impacts and economic returns between cooperatives and smallholder farmers. Additionally, the production and application of organic and chemical fertilizer and pesticide have been identified as major contributors to total environmental damage.

TI  - Evaluating the Impact of Forest Tenure Reform on Farmers' Investment in Public Welfare Forest Areas: A Case Study of Gansu Province, China
T2  - LAND
AB  - In recent times, forest tenure reform has become one of the most discussed agendas among local and global policymakers. Forest tenure is a contract that specifies who has rights to forestry resources and depicts who should utilize, maintain, and acquire them. It can have a significant impact on whether farmers invest in their forestland. The study's primary purpose is to explore whether and how the reform of forest rights affects farmers' investment in public welfare forestry. More specifically, the study thoroughly analyzes the impact of primary and supplementary reforms on farmers' investment in public welfare forest areas. We have outlined the theoretical framework using the theory of property rights and utilized the fixed-effect model and the Difference in Differences (DID) model to achieve research objectives. However, the empirical setup of the study has comprised time series data of 500 farmers, which was collected via interviews conducted at regular time intervals (2011-before the reform; 2013, 2015, and 2017- after the reform). The collective forest land welfare areas in Gansu Province, China, have been selected as the key data collection area. The study concludes that: (i) although the principle reform of forest tenure can stimulate farmers' investment intensity in the short term, it is insufficient in the long term. (ii) The supplementary reform of forest tenure can significantly promote farmers' long-term effective investment. There is a significant difference in forest land investment between the experimental and control groups, and this difference gradually expands over time. The study suggests that the government should pay more attention to the relevance of additional reforms to encourage the growth of forest rights mortgages and circulation. Moreover, the core themes of sustainable development in forestry should be highlighted.

TI  - Do cooperatives exclude small-scale farming households? Evidence from Fuchuan County, Guangxi Province
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The exclusion, or otherwise, of small-scale farmers by cooperatives determines whether they can be well engaged in the grand strategy of agricultural modernization. By identifying the exclusion pattern of cooperatives and using the field research data on farmers in Fuchuan, Guangxi, this study finds that cooperatives tend to screen their members via both explicit and implicit exclusion and that small-scale farmers are more likely to be excluded. The theoretical analysis conducted in this study reveals that excluding small-scale farmers is a rational choice made by cooperatives to pursue efficiency in the context of organizational form variation. Furthermore, cooperatives' organizational form variation and their decisions to exclude small-scale farmers are endogenous, thereby suggesting that cooperatives in China may become unions of rural elites. During the exploration of using cooperatives as a carrier to involve small-scale farmers in agricultural modernization, the phenomenon of cooperatives' exclusion of small-scale farmers needs to be highly emphasized.

TI  - Dualism or Dynamism ?
T2  - JOURNAL OF BELGIAN HISTORY-REVUE BELGE D HISTOIRE CONTEMPORAINE-BELGISCH TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR NIEUWSTE GESCHIEDENIS
AB  - An Analysis of the Congolese Rural Economy in the Interwar Years
   The Belgian Congo experienced radical socioeconomic change in the Interwar years. From the 1920s, the mining industry expanded, replacing agricultural produce as the Colony's principal export. At the same time, it saw the introduction of capitalist forms of agriculture to the agrarian sector. As a consequence of these transitions, some authors have argued that a "dual" economy evolued, in which market and non-marked forms of agriculture were separated. However, this article argues that, rather than a static dual economy, a dynamic "hybrid" form emerged in which market and non-market forms of production were joined.
   The first part of the article analyses the types of agriculture present in the Belgian Congo : collectives, Cultures obligatoires ('Compulsery cultivations') introduced in 1917, plantations, smallholdings and the Paysannats indigenes ('Indigerous peasant culturations') introduced in 1936. The second section demonstrates that the assimilation of the Congolese population was often accompanied by coercion, and sometimes violence, and led to a decline in collective agriculture. The Congolese population resisted, but was forced to develop new strategies to survive. Part of the local population switched from agriculture at a large-scale communal level to working in small-scale household types, in a process known as "Peasantification". The final part of the article emphasizes that, as a result of this change, a dynamic interaction developed between capitalist and non-capitalist forms of production in the Interwar years. This was possible because of the flexibility of the Congolese farmers, who were able to combine subsistence agriculture with (industrial or agrarian) wage labor. Considering these findings, looking at the Congolese economy as dual is unhelpful and misleading.

TI  - Land rights and investment incentives: Evidence from China?s Latest Rural Land Titling Program
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - We compile a panel dataset from official surveys of 2010-2015 to study how China's latest rural land titling program affected households' long-term agricultural investment. Applying the DD method and the PSM-DD method, we find that the rural land titling program had a positive effect on households' land-related invest-ment (measured by the application of organic fertiliser). In addition, we present 3 pieces of evidence which support the view that the positive investment effect was due to enhanced incentives as a result of improved land tenure security. First, the investment effect was significant for land-related investment, but not significant for non-land-related investment (measured by the purchase of agricultural machinery). Second, the investment ef-fect was stronger for the households that saw a greater improvement in their land tenure security. Third, the investment effect on households' own contracted land was stronger than that on their rented-in land, unless the households had long-term (i.e., more than one year) written rental contracts for their rented-in land.

TI  - Climate-Smart Agriculture Technologies and Smallholder Farmers' Welfare: Evidence from Cashew Nuts (Anacardium occidentale) Farming System in Lindi, Tanzania
T2  - GLOBAL SOCIAL WELFARE
AB  - This study assessed the effect of the adoption of climate-smart cashew nut technologies on smallholder farmers' welfare in Lindi, Tanzania. Multivariate probit, endogenous switching regression, and inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment were used for analysis. Empirical results on the levels of adoption revealed that 46.53% of the farm households planted improved cashew varieties, 79.21% used pesticides/herbicides, and 21.29% used inorganic fertilizers. Significant factors that influence the probability of interrelated adoption of climate-smart cashew nut technologies were off-farm income, extension contacts, access to credit, farm size, cooperative member, years of formal education, cashew farming experience, household age, and gender. The results further revealed that the adoption of climate-smart cashew nut technologies improves the farmers' welfare. The study recommends the improvements in extension services, enlargement of the cashew farm sizes, financial support for farmers, strengthening cooperative societies unions, and improvement on technologies disseminations.

TI  - Barriers to Household Risk Management: Evidence from India
T2  - AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - Why do many households remain exposed to large exogenous sources of nonsystematic income risk? We use a series of randomized field experiments in rural India to test the importance of price and nonprice factors in the adoption of an innovative rainfall insurance product. Demand is significantly price sensitive, but widespread take-up would not be achieved even if the product offered a payout ratio comparable to US insurance contracts. We present evidence suggesting that lack of trust, liquidity constraints, and limited salience are significant nonprice frictions that constrain demand. We suggest possible contract design improvements to mitigate these frictions.

TI  - Economic analysis of cotton production in Adamawa State, Nigeria
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - Cotton production has long been a good contributor to the Gross Domestic Product of Nigeria and this sector provides employment for some of the country's teeming population. Production dates back to the 1960s and 1970s. Poor management and the oil boom period reduced production of both lint and seed. Despite all these factors, production still continues on a small and medium scale among farmers. There is a new trend to revitalize the ailing cotton farming industries and associated business. To achieve this, an understanding of the production potential and economics of production were essential. One hundred and ninety-nine cotton outgrowers randomly selected among cotton farmers from the cotton belt of Adamawa state, Nigeria were interviewed to provide information on production capabilities, constraints and economics of production for duration of three years. Findings indicated that most of the outgrowers are male and married, and have had substantial experience in cotton production. They are registered with one cotton farmers association of their choice. Economic analysis of production cost indicated that of the variable cost of cotton production/hectare, labour alone accounted for 50% of the total. The regression analysis showed that the best fitted model is the double Log function; it recorded a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.61. In cotton production the cost of land rent correlated negatively with the cost of ploughing and planting. It was evident from the survey that cotton production in Adamawa state is challenged largely by poor pricing. Fluctuation in the price and cotton yield was noticed during the survey period. The study recommends the provision of input at subsidized price, functional extension services and establishment of a cotton commodity board to stimulate cotton production.

Through cross-sectional data analysis, we use a regression adjustment with the inverse probability weighted to estimate the average treatment effect on the treated. The results show a positive impact on sustainability indicators. However, there is a stronger impact economically than socially or environmentally. These findings suggest that participation in collective action can be an important strategy for farmers, as it reduces transaction costs and allows for greater access to information and knowledge, thus improving farmers' sustainability.

TI  - Factors Influencing Willingness to Be Vaccinated against COVID-19 in Nigeria
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Vaccines have been historically used to address some pressing health problems in the world. COVID-19 presents no exception, although vaccine hesitancy remains a major bottleneck in some countries. This study analyzed the factors influencing willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in Nigeria. The data are from the 10th wave of COVID-19 National Longitudinal Phone Survey (COVID-19 NLPS) that was conducted in 2021. The data were analyzed with Logit regression. The result showed that the national acceptance rate of COVID-19 vaccine was 85.29%. The North East had the highest acceptance rate (96.14%), while the South East (71.80%) had the lowest value. Rural areas had higher vaccine acceptance rates of 87.80% as compared against 81.41% for urban areas. Logit regression result showed that urban residents in the South East zone and the South South zone were not too worried about contracting COVID-19 or not worried at all about contracting COVID-19, saw COVID-19 as not much of a threat to household finance or COVID-19 as not a threat at all to households' finances, which significantly reduced the log odds of residents' willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 (p < 0.05). However, age, the COVID-19 preventive compliance index and needing medical services significantly increased the log odds of the willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 vaccines (p < 0.05). Addressing the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria through vaccination requires significant interventions for ensuring regional and sectoral balances in vaccine acceptability through interventions and programmes for promoting individuals' perception of health risk and vulnerability.

TI  - Drivers of Bushmeat Hunting and Perceptions of Zoonoses in Nigerian Hunting Communities
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Bushmeat hunting threatens biodiversity and increases the risk of zoonotic pathogen transmission. Nevertheless, limited information exists on patterns of contact with wildlife in communities that practice bushmeat hunting, especially with respect to social drivers of hunting behavior. We used interview responses from hunters and non-hunters in rural hunting communities in Nigeria to: 1) quantify contact rates with wildlife, 2) identify specific hunting behaviors that increase frequency of contact, 3) identify socioeconomic factors that predispose individuals to hunt, and 4) measure perceptions of risk. Participants engaged in a variety of behaviors that increased contact with wild animals, including: butchering to sell (37%), being injured (14%), using body parts for traditional medicine (19%), collecting carcasses found in forests and/or farms (18%), and keeping as pets (16%). Hunters came into contact with wildlife significantly more than non-hunters, even through non-hunting exposure pathways. Participants reported hunting rodents (95%), ungulates (93%), carnivores (93%), primates (87%), and bats (42%), among other prey. Reported hunting frequencies within taxonomic groups of prey were different for different hunting behaviors. Young age, lower education level, larger household size, having a father who hunts, and cultural group were all associated with becoming a hunter. Fifty-five percent of respondents were aware that they could contract diseases from wild animals, but only 26% of these individuals reported taking protective measures. Overall, hunters in this setting frequently contact a diversity of prey in risky ways, and the decision to become a hunter stems from family tradition, modified by economic necessity. Conservation and public health interventions in such settings may be most efficient when they capitalize on local knowledge and target root socio-economic and cultural drivers that lead to hunting behavior. Importantly, interventions that target consumption alone will not be sufficient; other drivers and modes of interaction with wildlife must also be considered.

Testing for gender-age discrimination among household members using Deaton's (1989) method, results suggest a general bias favoring boys over girls in allocation of consumption goods, however, the findings are not always statistically significant. Intrahousehold resource allocation rules are then examined to see if such discrimination is based on the unanimous decision of parents. The novelty in our test on allocation rule are: (1) use of grandparental variables as extra-household environmental parameters (EEPs) in expenditure estimation, (2) derivation of a test of the unitary model that only requires EEPs, and (3) semi-formal use of survival status of grandparents in testing collective models. It is interesting that spouse's father characteristics are importantly correlated with greater mother and child goods expenditure shares, and smaller father goods shares. Their survival status matters, and this is stronger evidence for a collective as opposed to unitary model.

TI  - Translocal social capital as a resource for community-based responses to coastal flooding - Evidence from urban and rural areas on Java, Indonesia
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - Social capital is used widely by households in the Global South as a collective response mechanism to natural hazards. It is argued that these processes serve as substitutes for scarce financial and human capital in poor communities. To date, the majority of studies on social capital in the Global South has framed these processes in place-based ways, assuming that they are developed and deployed within local spaces. However, in an increasingly globalized world, people's social networks increasingly transcend the local, and social capital is therefore manifested in multi-scalar geographies. The aim of this study is to assess the significance of this translocality for the use of social capital in responding to natural hazards. Using evidence from communities under threat of sea-water inundation in rural and urban areas in North Java, we focus on both the outcomes of translocal social capital for hazard adaptation and the origins of these social ties. Our results show that households with a higher number of translocal contacts are more likely to take proactive measures against flooding and subsidence. Furthermore, we found that the conditions for establishing translocal social capital differ between rural and urban areas, and we show that the propensity for translocal social capital is stratified along economic lines. Poorer households have fewer translocal social ties, which impairs their ability to adapt to environmental threats. Thus, our results contest former assumptions about (translocal) social capital being a prime resource for the poor. The paper concludes that interventions in poor communities designed to enhance translocal social capital may offer answers to this problem.

TI  - Community Mobilization is Associated with HIV Testing Behaviors and Their Psychosocial Antecedents Among Zambian Adults: Results from a Population-Based Study
T2  - AIDS AND BEHAVIOR
AB  - Community mobilization (CM) is a vital yet under-explored avenue for increasing HIV testing in generalized HIV epidemic settings. Using multi-stage cluster sampling, a population-based sample of 3535 Zambian adults (mean age: 28 years, 50% women) were recruited from 14 districts to complete a household survey. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to re-validate a 23-item, 5-factor CM scale. Multivariable logistic and Poisson regression were then used to identify associations of CM with HIV testing behaviors and their psychosocial antecedents. A 21-item, 3-factor ("Leadership", "Collective Action Capacity", and "Social Cohesion") CM solution emerged from EFA (Cronbach's alpha 0.88). Among men and in rural settings, higher CM was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with elevated odds of HIV testing and more past-year HIV testing discussion sources, controlling for socio-demographics and sexual behaviors. Results underscore the importance of prioritizing CM to cultivate more favorable environments for HIV testing uptake, especially for men and rural residents.

TI  - Remittances and well-being among rural-to-urban migrants in China
T2  - REVIEW OF ECONOMICS OF THE HOUSEHOLD
AB  - The main objective of this paper is to propose a systematic approach to empirically analyse the relationship between sending remittances and the utility of migrants, as proxied by their subjective well-being (SWB). Using data from a new survey on China, we estimate models in which a SWB measure is regressed on the level of remittances, finding a sizeable positive correlation. The estimates vary with the socio-economic characteristics of migrants, migration experience and the diversity of family arrangements. As a complementary objective, we use SWB measures to elicit the motivations behind remittances, finding evidence that both altruistic and contractual motivations are at work among rural-to-urban migrants in China.

TI  - Farmers' perceptions and role of institutional arrangements in climate change adaptation: Insights from rainfed Pakistan
T2  - CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
AB  - Rainfed farmers are among the most vulnerable farming communities to climate change in Pakistan because of the heavy reliance of crop farming on rain and of farmers' livelihoods on crop farming. The best and most timely responses against climate change are suitable adaptation measures. Accurately perceiving the risks associated with climate change is an essential factor for planning and then implementing adaptations. Using farm household-level data of 400 rainfed farmers collected through a well-designed and field-tested questionnaire, this study examines the association between various adaptation stages (climate risk perceptions, adaptation planning, and implementation of adaptation) and their determinants using a multivariate probit (MVP) model. The findings indicate that farmers' perceptions of climatic changes are in line with historical climatic data. Climate risk management (CRM) trainings and digital agriculture extension and communication (DAEC) services (indicators of formal institutional arrangements) show a highly significant impact on all adaptation stages. Input market distance, farmer cooperative meetings (an indicator of informal institutional arrangement), off-farm income, education, and number of male family members are among the other key determinants. A highly significant association between various adaptation stages indicates that accurate climate risk perceptions lead to planning and implementation of adaptations. When risk perceptions are underestimated or lacking, then adaptations do not occur. The results further indicate that the timely availability of reliable information on advanced agricultural inputs, weather parameters, crop farming advisory services, and market information could help rainfed farmers devise sound adaptations to minimize risks associated with climate change. The study recommends the provision of CRM trainings and DAEC services to provide a better understanding and promote sound adaptation planning through the adaptive capacity enhancement of rainfed farming communities for sustainable production and livelihood

TI  - Epidemic risk of arboviral diseases: Determining the habitats, spatial-temporal distribution, and abundance of immature Aedes aegypti in the Urban and Rural areas of Zanzibar, Tanzania
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Author summary
   Dengue is considered the most important mosquito-borne viral disease and a global public health threat. In recent decades, large scale epidemics of dengue have occurred across sub-Saharan Africa including mainland Tanzania. Aedes aegypti is identified as the principal vector for dengue transmission in most affected countries. In the absence of antiviral treatment and as a dengue vaccine is not readily available; dengue prevention depends largely on vector control. As mosquitoes develop resistance towards commonly applied chemical insecticides, environmental management targeting the destruction of larval habitats is recommended. In Zanzibar, little is known about Ae. aegypti in terms of type, magnitude, or distribution of its larval habitats. In this study, we identified the main larval habitats of Ae. aegypti, their seasonal variations and factors contributing to Ae. aegypti abundance across urban and rural settings of Unguja Island in Zanzibar. We found widespread presence and abundance of the vector with plastic and metal containers as well as car tires identified as the most important larval habitats. Season, location of water container, water storage, sun exposure, presence of vegetation and organic matter were among the factors associated with high Ae. aegypti abundance. This study is the first to document widespread occurrence and distribution of Ae. aegypti in Zanzibar and highlights the need for the establishment of a nation-wide Aedes surveillance program to guide the development and monitoring of targeted, context specific vector control interventions for prevention of dengue and other arboviral epidemics. Aedes surveillance involves periodic inspection of households and surrounding environments for presence of larvae/pupae in water-holding containers which are then targeted for larval source reduction, as well as monitoring of adult mosquito populations.
   Background
   In Zanzibar, little is known about the arboviral disease vector Aedes aegypti in terms of abundance, spatio-temporal distribution of its larval habitats or factors associated with its proliferation. Effective control of the vector requires knowledge on ecology and habitat characteristics and is currently the only available option for reducing the risk of arboviral epidemics in the island nation of Zanzibar.
   Methodology
   We conducted entomological surveys in households and surrounding compounds from February to May 2018 in the urban (Mwembemakumbi and Chumbuni) and rural (Chuini and Kama) Shehias (lowest government administrative unit) situated in the Urban-West region of Unguja island, Zanzibar. Larvae and pupae were collected, transported to the insectary, reared to adult, and identified to species level. Characteristics and types of water containers were also recorded on site. Generalized linear mixed models with binomial and negative binomial distributions were applied to determine factors associated with presence of Ae. aegypti immatures (i.e. both larvae and pupae) or pupae, alone and significant predictors of the abundance of immature Ae. aegypti or pupae, respectively.
   Results
   The survey provided evidence of widespread presence and abundance of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in both urban and rural settings of Unguja Island. Interestingly, rural setting had higher numbers of infested containers, all immatures, and pupae than urban setting. Likewise, higher House and Breteau indices were recorded in rural compared to the urban setting. There was no statistically significant difference in Stegomyia indices between seasons across settings. Plastics, metal containers and car tires were identified as the most productive habitats which collectively produced over 90% of all Ae. aegypti pupae. Water storage, sun exposure, vegetation, and organic matter were significant predictors of the abundance of immature Ae. aegypti.
   Conclusions
   Widespread presence and abundance of Ae. aegypti were found in rural and urban areas of Unguja, the main island of Zanzibar. Information on productive habitats and predictors of colonization of water containers are important for the development of a routine Aedes surveillance system and targeted control interventions in Zanzibar and similar settings.

TI  - Achieving Palm Oil Sustainability Under Contract: Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and Family Farmers in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This paper examines how local institutions and family farming labor relations shift and reconfigure in response to The Roundtable on Sustainable Oil Palm (RSPO) certification in Brazil where demanding state regulations exist in a context of uneven enforcement. We use the concept of politics and practice of grounding to explore the Contract Farming (CF) model of Agropalma, the first palm oil export company in Brazil certified with RSPO. Our analysis reveals how the grounding of RSPO's requirement of compliance with applicable domestic laws emerged as a particular point of tension, especially as a result of the CF mechanism. First, despite Agropalma's initial active role in title facilitation, certification made it more difficult for producers to join the CF scheme due to the lack of property titles and their inability to comply with the nominally strict Brazilian environmental regulations. Second, compliance with Brazilian labor protection broke traditional patterns of involving all family members in crop management, and clashes between the company and its outgrowers emerged because of stricter changes in hiring requirements. Our analysis underscores the complex process of reconciling environmental and labor -standard aspirations of Global North certification schemes with the existing legal and enforcement frame-works in the Global South.

TI  - Community preparedness for highly pathogenic Avian influenza on Bali and Lombok, Indonesia
T2  - RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH
AB  - Introduction: The Asia-Pacific region is the likeliest location for the next significant outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Indonesia has experienced HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and humans each year since 2003 and has had the highest case fatality rate for human cases. The purposes of this study were to capture the knowledge of avian influenza and of poultry-raising practices in two regions of Indonesia and to evaluate the impact and extent of activities undertaken to 2010 through the National Strategic Plan for Avian Influenza Control at the village level.
   Methods: A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used to investigate the multiple influences on behaviours, decisions and actions taken by poultry-raising households, and by villages and communities, regarding the threat of HPAI. Between June 2010 and May 2011 a structured survey of 400 households was conducted on Lombok and of 402 on Bali, inviting Sector 3 (small-scale independent commercial poultry farms) and Sector 4 (village household) poultry raisers to participate. Focus groups and in-depth interviews were convened with key stakeholders, including livestock and animal health and public health officials, community leaders and villagers.
   Results: From the focus group and in-depth interviews, it appears that the flow of information through the national HPAI control program has been efficient at the top levels (from national to provincial, then to districts and subdistricts). However, these findings show that effective transmission of information from subdistrict to rural village level and from village leaders to community members has been limited. The degree of community preparedness for HPAI on Bali and Lombok appears minimal. Knowledge of government activities was more extensive at Bali sites, while only limited government programs and activities occurred at the village level on Lombok. Activities conducted by government agencies from provincial to village level were limited in scope and need to be further developed to ensure safe poultry-handling practices and biosecurity measures. On both Bali and Lombok, community respondents knew the signs and symptoms of sick birds but did not differentiate well between HPAI and other bird diseases. On both islands, more than 60% of respondents were reluctant to report sudden deaths of poultry. The lack of a government compensation program for destroyed flocks contributed to this unwillingness to report.
   Conclusions: While the Indonesian government's planning efforts for HPAI are commendable, the plan has not been effective, as it depends on the cooperative actions of people with small rural farms who have not been consulted in the development of the plan, have not been adequately instructed on the nature of the plan, and perceive no benefits to themselves from prevention efforts. Context-appropriate mechanisms for communicating zoonotic risk and options for risk mitigation that do not result in net loss to poor households are also needed.

TI  - Sustainability assessment of greenhouse vegetable farming practices from environmental, economic, and socio-institutional perspectives in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - To provide growing population with sufficient food, greenhouse vegetable production has expanded rapidly in recent years in China and sustainability of its farming practices is a major concern. Therefore, this study assessed the sustainability of greenhouse vegetable farming practices from environmental, economic, and socio-institutional perspectives in China based on selected indicators. The empirical data were collected through a survey of 91 farm households from six typical greenhouse vegetable production bases and analysis of environmental material samples. The results showed that heavy fertilization in greenhouse vegetable bases of China resulted in an accumulation of N, P, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn in soil, nutrient eutrophication in irrigation water, and high Cd in some leaf vegetables cultivated in acidic soil. Economic factors including decreased crop yield in conventional farming bases, limited and site-dependent farmers' income, and lack of complete implementation of subsidy policies contributed a lot to adoption of heavy fertilization by farmers. Also, socio-institutional factors such as lack of unified management of agricultural supplies in the bases operated in cooperative and small family business models and low agricultural extension service efficiency intensified the unreasonable fertilization. The selection of cultivated vegetables was mainly based on farmers' own experience rather than site-dependent soil conditions. Thus, for sustainable development of greenhouse vegetable production systems in China, there are two key aspects. First, it is imperative to reduce environmental pollution and subsequent health risks through integrated nutrient management and the planting strategy of selected low metal accumulation vegetable species especially in acidic soil. Second, a conversion of cooperative and small family business models of greenhouse vegetable bases to enterprises should be extensively advocated in future for the unified agricultural supplies management and improved agricultural extension service efficiency, which in turn can stabilize vegetable yields and increase farmers' benefits.

TI  - Government-civil society co-management contracts for rural water services: lessons from India
T2  - POLICY DESIGN AND PRACTICE
AB  - The primary source of water for most residents of India's nearly 640,000 villages is a handpump that extracts water from a shallow aquifer and is shared by several households. The handpumps require regular maintenance, given that mud, silt, salinity of groundwater, and usage degrade the moving parts over time. The challenge for state water authorities is to keep up with the operation and maintenance (O&M) of numerous handpumps. State water authorities have, therefore, shifted to contracting out the O&M activities to non-state actors including civil society organizations (CSOs) and private contractors. This study compares handpump O&M service outcomes of a co-management contract between the state water authority of Gujarat, India, and a community-based CSO with that of a standard contract between the state water authority and a private (non-CSO) contractor. We find the quality of handpump repair and maintenance in villages served by the CSO contractor to be better than that in villages served by the private contractor. Repair times for handpumps used by lower caste households are significantly lower in CSO-served villages suggesting that engaging CSOs can bring about equity in access to water. We also find that service quality significantly reduces the time spent collecting water thus increasing the overall welfare of rural households. We conclude that innovative contractual relationships such as co-management contracts between states and CSOs can prove to be an effective tool in providing, managing, and expanding public services, and enhancing the welfare of rural households.

TI  - Do farmers adopt fewer conservation practices on rented land? Evidence from straw retention in China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - We examine how land tenure arrangements affect Chinese crop farmers' adoption of straw retention, a key conservation practice promoted by the Chinese government in part to curb rising air pollution. Using data from a 2016 farmer household survey covering 1659 crop plots in Henan Province in central China, we analyze whether farmers are less likely to adopt straw retention on rented plots compared to own-contracted plots. To address the potential endogeneity of the choice of renting from others, we use an instrument exploiting the role of remittance income from household members migrated to cities in a bivariate probit model and a control function approach, respectively. Our main results reveal that the Chinese crop farmers' likelihood of adopting straw retention were almost cut in half on rented plots compared to their owned plots, assuming the assumptions for biprobit or control functions hold. This suggests greater attention is needed to examine the spillovers across agricultural and environmental policies as China pushes for both a nationwide land rental market and more sustainable agricultural practices.

TI  - Effects of land management change on spatial variability of organic matter and nutrients in paddy field: A case study of Pinghu, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The Household Responsibility System initiated in the late 1970s in China has brought a profound change to its rural economy. The shift from the collective farming system to individual family farms has changed land management. The change, including fertilization and crop systems, may have significant effects on soil quality and agro-environmental sustainability. However, very little research is being carried out on the impact of reformed land tenure systems on the spatial variability of soil nutrients. In this study, geostatistics was applied to analyze changes in the spatial variability of soil organic matter and nutrients in paddy fields in Pinghu County, China after 20 years of land management change. In 1984 and 2002, 617 and 131 locations were selected, respectively, for collecting surface soil samples to analyze soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK). From 1984 to 2002, variabililly of the SOM and TN changed from strongly to moderately spatial-dependent, and the variability of AP remained weakly dependent on space, but that of the AK changed from moderately to weakly spatial-dependent. That the trend of the variability of four soil properties in 2002 became weaker than that in 1984 showed that the extrinsic factors (soil management practices, such as fertilization) weakened the effect by intrinsic factors (soil formation factors, such as soil parent materials) owing to a long period of land management change. The temporal geographic maps of the SOM and nutrients spatial distributions suggested that the concentrations of the SOM and nutrients had been changed to different extents during the period. Significant increase in AP and decrease in AK were noted. The changes were likely due to the imbalance between N, R and K fertilizers and increased grain yield.

TI  - Commercialization level and determinants of market participation of smallholder wheat farmers in northern Ethiopia
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Wheat market participation improves the income and economic growth of many smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. Despite this, smallholder farmers are not enough to participate in the wheat market so that commercialization level is very low due to different factors. This study, therefore, identified the determinants of market participation of smallholder wheat farmers and measured its commercialization level in Northern Ethiopia. The data were collected from 190 randomly selected sample households using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and the double hurdle model were used to analyze the collected data. The descriptive result revealed that the average commercialization level of the sample wheat farmers was 10.26%. The model result showed that the age, educational level, current selling price, wheat market experience, access to market/information, off/none farm income, family size, market orientation, distance to all weather roads and land size allocated for wheat significantly affected the smallholder wheat farmers' market participation. Therefore, a policy on improving market access (by improving market infrastructure, marketing facilities, and encouraging contract farming), farmers' awareness on market (by farmers' training), and productivity of land (using the best agronomic practice and improved technology) should be designed to enhance smallholder farmers' commercialization level.

TI  - Does integrated medical insurance system alleviate the difficulty of using cross-region health Care for the Migrant Parents in China-- evidence from the China migrants dynamic survey
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Many internal migrants during the urbanization process in China are Migrant Parents, the aging group who move to urban areas to support their family involuntarily. They are more vulnerable economically and physically than the younger migrants. However, the fragmentation of rural and urban health insurance schemes divided by "hukou" household registration system limit migrant's access to healthcare services in their resident location. Some counties have started to consolidate the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) and the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) as one Integrated Medical Insurance Schemes (IMIS) from 2008. The consolidation aimed to reduce the disparity between different schemes and increase the health care utilization of migrants.
   Results: Using the inpatient sample of migrant parents from China Migrants Dynamic Survey in 2015, we used Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for regression models. We found that the migrant parents covered by the IMIS are more likely to choose inpatient services and seek medical treatment in the migrant destination. We further subdivide Non-IMISs into NCMSs and URBMIs in the regression to alleviate the doubt about endogenous. The results revealed that the migrant parents in IMIS use more local medical services than both of them in URBMI and NCMS.
   Conclusions: The potential mechanisms of our results could be that IMIS alleviates the difficulty of seeking medical care in migrant destinations by improving the convenience of medical expense reimbursement and enhancing health insurance benefits.

TI  - Determinants of farmers' participation in collective maintenance of irrigation infrastructure in KwaZulu-Natal
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
CP  - 17th WaterNet/WARFSA/GWPSA Symposium on Integrated Water Resources Management - Water Security, Sustainability and Development in Eastern and Africa Southern
AB  - The decentralization framework and the Dublin Principles on Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) emphasize the need for a participatory approach to irrigation water management. This study identifies the factors influencing farmers' decision to, and extent of participation in the maintenance of irrigation infrastructure in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa based on cross-section data collected from 320 randomly selected smallholder irrigating farmers. A two-step Heckman regression model was applied in the analysis. It was established that households whose heads were older, block committee members, with larger irrigation plots, good soil quality and experiencing severe irrigation water shortages are more likely to participate in maintenance of irrigation infrastructure. On the other hand, farmers with insecure land tenure and with no access to irrigation water were less likely to make the decision to participate. Farmers who were members of the farming cooperative as well as block committee members and those paying irrigation water costs were likely to intensively participate in maintaining irrigation infrastructure. Therefore, decentralization alone cannot lead to improved irrigation outcomes. Several factors are necessary for households to participate intensively in the maintenance of irrigation infrastructure. Governments should address these challenges before handing irrigation schemes to their beneficiaries.

TI  - Demand for social health insurance: Evidence from the Chinese New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - This paper assesses the determinants of the enrolment in the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS), a heavily subsidized voluntary health insurance scheme in rural China. The analyses focus on the relationship between insurance purchase and health facility choice based on data drawn from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). The results show that households from villages that reported use of village clinics are more likely to be insured compared with households from villages that reported use of county hospitals. The results indicate that the perception of quality of care is an important factor affecting people's enrolment decisions. The NRCMS is expected to help patients obtain better quality health services from higher tier of the healthcare system that are unaffordable otherwise. However, given the prevailing fee for -service payment mechanism for health care, the insurance may also drive up the healthcare cost and direct patients to use more expensive and unnecessary hospital care.

TI  - The impact of producer organizations on farm performance: The case study of large farms from Slovakia
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - This paper estimates the farm level impact of producer organizations' (PO) membership in Slovakia and the effectiveness of support provided to POs under the EU Rural Development Programme (RDP). We employ the PSM-DID econometric approach on a database of large Slovak commercial farms for 2006 and 2015. First, our results show that belonging to a PO improves the economic performance of farms in Slovakia. Second, in the short-run the support granted under RDP 2007-2013 to newly established PO does not improve the farm performance; only established and older POs (and potentially supported in the past) generate benefits to their members. Third, the estimates provide indirect evidence that the disbursement of PO support granted in the financial period 2007-2013 was rather ineffective in selecting POs with the highest potential to generate benefits to its members. Our analysis confirms that many POs were created for the sole purpose just to benefit from the support. This result is reinforced by the observed high closure rate of supported POs.

TI  - The impact of health insurance on healthcare service use and costs: evidence from rural China
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the effects of introducing a health insurance program in rural China between 2004 and 2006, the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS). Design/methodology/approach The authors apply difference in difference and propensity score matching methods (PSM-DID) to a widely used panel dataset, the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). Findings are robust across several treatment and comparison groups used in previous NCMS studies. Findings Households who participated in NCMS increased the use of preventive services and western medicine, while lowering the use of traditional Chinese medicine. NCMS also reduced hospital use, out of pocket payments, travel time to healthcare facilities and waiting time to see doctors. The authors estimate that reductions in travel and waiting time saved roughly 52m U.S. dollars in 2006. Research limitations/implications Previously divergent findings on health insurance effects may be due to researchers studying health insurance across different healthcare delivery systems. In addition, in estimating how health insurance access affects healthcare costs, the authors should consider economic costs related to the time needed to access health services. Originality/value The authors study how health insurance access affects patients' choice of providers and economic costs to accessing health care services, outcomes that have not received much attention previously. The authors depart from previous NCMS studies by comparing several different approaches to identifying treatment and control groups when applying PSM-DID.

TI  - Influence of voluntary coffee certifications on cooperatives' advisory services and agricultural practices of smallholder farmers in Costa Rica
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION & EXTENSION
AB  - Purpose: This article explores how voluntary certifications influence the way cooperatives provide advisory services to their members and the influence of these services on agricultural practices. Design/Methodology/Approach: Case studies were conducted in four representative Costa Rican cooperatives interviewing twenty interviewed cooperative administrators and members to determine changes in advisory services and farming practices over the past twenty years and factors which influenced those changes. Findings: Certifications induce cooperatives to offer new services to support farmers. Cooperatives form collaborations with new stakeholders or reconfigure existing collaborations to provide advisory services to their members. These services have helped to shape farmers' attitudes about sustainable farming practices, though farm-level changes may be small. The main change at the cooperative level is adding new topics for group training, and certification issues are directly linked with practices such as maintaining a farm record book or wearing a mask when applying pesticides. Practices which compete with productivity are unlikely to change. Practical Implications: The results are useful to improve the advisory services provided by cooperatives by better identifying the key issues to be addressed to fulfill the certifications' requirements. Theoretical implications: Cooperatives are a relevant player to induce more sustainable practices, by providing or coordinating advisory services, but their efforts cannot be seen disconnected from a broader institutional environment. Originality/Value: We demonstrate that certifications change the intensity and scope of advisory services and induce cooperatives to engage with a more diverse network of stakeholders.

TI  - Analysis and Diagnosis of the Agrarian System in the Niayes Region, Northwest Senegal (West Africa)
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - The agrarian system Analysis and Diagnosis is used for this study, the goal of which was to provide a corpus of basic knowledge and elements of reflection necessary for the understanding the Niayes farming systems dynamics in Senegal, West Africa. Such holistic work has never been done before for this small region that provides the majority of vegetables in the area, thanks to its microclimate and access to fresh water in an arid country. Reading of the landscape and historical interviews coupled with fine-tuned household surveys were used to build a typology of agricultural production units (each type being represented by a production system). The main phases within the region's history were distinguished. Before colonization, agriculture was based on gathering and shifting agriculture (millet and peanut) in the southern region and transhumant stockbreeding in the North. During colonization, market gardening became a source of income as a response to cities' increasing demand. Two major droughts (in the 1970s and 1980s) have accelerated this movement. Extension of market gardening areas and intensification of activities were made possible by Sahelian migrants' influx and the creation of mbeye seddo, a contract that allows for sharing added value between the employer and seasonal workers, named sourghas. Over the past 20 years, the "race for motorization" has created important social gaps (added value sharing deserves review) and a risk of overexploitation of groundwater.

TI  - Collective management of an environmental threat when exposure is heterogeneous - A complementary methods approach
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We adopt a complementary methods approach to investigate whether and how heterogeneity in individual returns to a public good affects public good provision. We engage smallholder farmers in Sri Lanka in: a one-shot, framed, lab-in-the-field experiment, within which the farmers' rates of return to the public good are exogenously varied; and a survey including a question about the farmers' willingness to contribute time to the construction of a specific hypothetical public good, the return from which, for a given farmer, would depend on his or her circumstances in everyday life. In the former, we find weak evidence that heterogeneity in individual returns increases contributions. In the latter we find that those facing a higher return would contribute more, but no evidence that heterogeneity has an effect, either way, at the group-level. We conclude that heterogeneity in returns does not explain why collective action remains a challenge in farming communities in developing countries. From a methodological point of view, we find that using complementary methods provides a more balanced account of communities' potential engagement in public good provision. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Sharecropping, Insecure Land Rights and Land Titling Policies: A Case Study of Lac Alaotra, Madagascar
T2  - DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW
AB  - Sharecropping between poor landlords and rich tenants has hitherto been the subject of very little academic scrutiny. Given that such 'reverse share tenancy' contracts are mostly at odds with the canonical risk-sharing explanation for sharecropping, this article discusses a rationale for them that relies on weak property rights as well as the legal doctrine of adverse possession, and tests it using data from Lac Alaotra, Madagascar, where this type of tenancy accounts for one-third of land rentals. The empirical findings are discussed in relation to recent land-reform policies by the Government of Madagascar, the World Bank, IFAD, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation.

TI  - Impact of climate change adaptation strategies on rice productivity in South-west, Nigeria: An endogeneity corrected stochastic frontier model
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The study assessed the impact of climate change adaptation strategies on technical efficiency of smallholder rice farmers in South-west Nigeria. An endogeneity corrected stochastic frontier model which account for the endogeneity of adoption of adaptation strategies that is likely to depend on inefficiency was employed for the study. The result of the study revealed that adoption of adaption strategies is endogenously determined with rice productivity and hence, failure to account for endogeneity, the parameter efficiency estimates would be inconsistent The empirical results from the model show that quantity of labour, herbicides and the interaction of labour with both farm size and insecticides were statistically significant in explaining the variations in the efficiency of rice production in the study area. In addition, the study identified the combined effects of climate change adaptation strategies and some socioeconomic characteristics such as age, gender, education, farming experience, access to credit, access to information, membership of farmers in agricultural based cooperative and location of rice farmers as sources of technical inefficiencies. The study concluded that increase implementation of climate change adaptation strategies could enhance rice productivity and technical efficiency of rice farmers through timely access to climate change information and other related institutional support. Based on farmers' knowledge and understanding of changes in climatic conditions and the adaptation strategies to mitigate its effect, it is therefore important for the government, stakeholders and donor agencies to involve farmers in the climate change adaptation planning process.

TI  - The inequity of inpatient services in rural areas and the New-Type Rural Cooperative Medical System (NRCMS) in China: repeated cross sectional analysis
T2  - HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB  - Objective The main aim of the New-type Rural Cooperative Medical System (NRCMS) put into effect in 2003 was to reduce financial barriers in accessing health care services among vulnerable populations. The aim of this study was to assess the association between NRCMS and income related inequality in hospital utilization among rural inhabitants in Jiangxi Province, China.
   Methods A multistage stratified random cluster sampling method was adopted to select 1838, 1879, and 1890 households as participants in 2003/2004, 2008 and 2014, respectively. The Erreygers Concentration index (EI) of two measures of hospital inpatient care including admission to hospital and hospital avoidance, were calculated to measure income-related inequality. The decomposition of the EI was performed to characterize the contributions of socioeconomic and need factors to the measured inequality.
   Results An affluent-focused (pro-rich) inequity was observed for hospital admission adjusting for need factors over time. The level of inequity for hospital admission decreased dramatically, while hospital avoidance decreased marginally, and with a high value (EI, -0.0176) in 2008. The implementation of the NRCMS was associated with decreased inequity in 2008 and in 2014, but the associations were limited. Income contributed the most to the inequality of hospital utilization each year.
   Conclusion The coverage of the NRCMS expanded to cover nearly all rural inhabitants in Jiangxi province by 2014 and was associated with a very small reduction in inequalities in admission to hospital. In order to increase equitable access to health care, additional financial protections for vulnerable populations are needed. Improving the relatively low level of medical services in township hospitals, and low rate of reimbursement and financial assistance with the NRCMS is recommended.

TI  - Cheap talk and coordination in the lab and in the field: Collective commercialization in Senegal
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - Most developing-country farms are small and engage in cooperative agriculture. Prior literature has argued that mechanisms aimed at facilitating smallholder coordination such as cooperatives are central to stimulating market participation. At the same time, cooperatives have not always been able to engage in collective action. In this paper, we conduct neutrally framed coordination games and a natural field experiment to test the effect of cheap talk among members of groundnut-producing cooperatives in Senegal. In both experiments, we ask farmers how much they intend to contribute to the group prior to them actually doing so and then, confidentially reveal aggregate intentions to other cooperative members. Based on survey and administrative data, we find that (1) revealing farmers' intentions improves collective commercialization and this effect increases with group size and (2) learning in the lab transfers to behavior in the day-to-day environment. Implications for policy and future work are discussed.

TI  - Economic Analysis of Alternative Ware Potato Storage Technologies in Uganda
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POTATO RESEARCH
AB  - In Uganda, potato is primarily grown as a cash crop and smallholder farmers sell majority of their produce immediately after harvest. Only a few farmers store ware potato for later sale using various traditional storage methods. Main reasons are farmers' immediate need for cash, the low volumes of potato harvested, fear of loss during storage due to pests and diseases, and a lack of adequate storage facilities. In order to exploit the seasonal market price fluctuations and increase the economic return of potato farming, improved individual and collective ambient ware potato storage units were introduced. Unlike traditional storage facilities that maintain the marketability of stored potato up to five weeks only, improved ambient stores can maintain their marketability up to nine weeks. This article uses cost-benefit analysis methods to compare the economic performance of improved ambient stores with traditional storage facilities. Results indicate that few of the traditional and improved collective storage units generated profit, an aspect that was attributed to management challenges. The improved individual stores performed overall well, generating higher profit margins than improved collective stores. Improved individual stores had an average payback period of three to four years that could even be reduced to less than one year if used at full capacity. Due to their characteristics, improved individual ambient ware potato stores thus seem to be particularly suitable to substantially increase the income of potato farming households.

In addition to providing nation-wide evidence on a sensitive topic, we find positive impacts, equivalent increasing land values by 30 percent, of reform even in the short term that originated in villages where democratic election of leaders ensured a minimum level of accountability, pointing towards complementarity between good governance and legal reform.

TI  - Rethinking policy and institutional imperatives for integrated watershed management: Lessons and experiences from semi-arid India
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - This study investigates the institutional and policy issues that limit effective participation of resource users in community watershed programs and identifies key lessons for harnessing collective action and its effectiveness in achieving economic and environmental outcomes. It shows that spatial and temporal attributes of watersheds and the associated market failures that accelerate degradation of agricultural and environmental resources require innovative policy and institutional arrangements for coordinating use and management of resources. Under enabling policies, IWM can effectively contribute towards diversification of production into high-value products, reversal of resource degradation, growth in the incomes of the poor and enhance the ability to mitigate the effect of drought. However, the degree of biophysical and social complexity within watershed communities could often undermine incentives for collective action, thwart distribution of benefits against the landless and resource-poor households and even lead to depletion of groundwater resources. Governments and other stakeholders have a unique role to play in kick-starting the process of transformation through strategic natural resource and productivity-enhancing investments that strengthen local capacity for collective action and generate local public goods. Such collective investments could serve as building blocks for private productivity-enhancing and risk-mitigating investments as they boost profitability of productive assets (land and labor) and encourage farmer adoption of beneficial conservation practices. The lessons and experiences also show that integrating interventions along watershed frontiers would require a flexible learning alliance of institutions and cross-disciplinary teams with complementary skills and competencies.

TI  - Determinants of livelihood diversification: The case wildlife tourism in four coastal communities in Oaxaca, Mexico
T2  - TOURISM MANAGEMENT
AB  - Diversification is a process by which households increase the number of economic activities in different sectors to improve their well-being and chance of survival. The aim of this research is to study the determinants of livelihood diversification with a specific emphasis on wildlife watching in the coastal communities of Oaxaca, Mexico. Based on household surveys, two econometric models were used to examine the differences regarding the asset determinants for those households increasing the number of economic activities and those involved in wildlife tourism. The results reveal four common variables distributed between capitals and specify that average household age, environmental consciousness, characteristics of the land, membership or participation in an organization (cooperative) and government transfers are determinants of a household's diversification into wildlife tourism. Policy recommendations include focusing on households with young people, providing support for social capital and policy coherence to guarantee basic needs and tourism planning design.

TI  - Factors affecting entry and intensity in informal rental land markets in Southern Ethiopian highlands
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Informal land transactions, particularly rental land markets, are emerging in rural Ethiopia in response to the inadequacies of the administratively based land distribution system to meet the growing demand for land and correct imbalances in factor proportions at the farm level. These informal land markets provide a vehicle to equalise factor proportions at the farm level and to improve productivity and hence households' welfare. Among the farmers who lease out land, those who live in the highland-areas, where land is scarce and unequal, are more likely to engage in these markets. Increases in the size of land holdings relative to labour and livestock ownership, the number of non-working household members and pressure for subsistence increase the likelihood of leasing out land. On the other hand, increases in the number of working adults, improved nutritional status and greater wealth affect negatively the supply of land into these markets. The potential exists for these markets to improve factor equalisation, reduce inequality in land holdings, and shift the income position of participating households. However, success depends on whether other factor markets are functioning to thwart forced disposal of land to meet subsistence. Public policy has pivotal role in fostering the growth of these markets and their land transfer and factor equalisation functions by ensuring their legally enforceable status, and removing legal restrictions that constrain choices of contracts and trading over greater distances. In addition, both long and short-term policy measures are needed to reduce the extent to which poor farmers engage in distress transactions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Determinants of Smallholder Farmers' Participation in Improved Sheep Production: The Case of Doyogena District, Kembata Tembaro Zone, Southern Ethiopia
T2  - ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - Background. Improved sheep production practices are becoming relevant, but smallholder farmers' involvement in improved sheep production was below expectations and detailed studies were restricted on the determinants of the participation of smallholder farmers in improved sheep production. This research was conducted to examine the determinants of the involvement of smallholder farmers in enhanced sheep production in the study area. Methods. Multi-stages sampling techniques were used for this study. Firstly, improved sheep production had a big effect on the incomes of households of participants and nonparticipants. Finally, three kebeles were chosen by basic random sampling, and the third was picked for systematic sampling by 144 survey respondents. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered from primary and secondary sources. Data collection techniques were undertaken by surveys, focus group discussions, and key informants. Quantitative data were used to evaluate descriptive statistics, such as average, frequency, standard deviation, scope, and inferential t-test and chi-square statistics, and a logit model. Qualitative data obtained from focus group discussion and key informants were analyzed by narrative and used for survey data triangulation. Results. Out of the 144 samples, 51 were participants and 93 were nonparticipants. Participation determinants found in this research field were household labor, age, communication frequency with developers, membership in cooperatives, land ownership, participation in credit, and off-farm income. Improved sheep production had a major effect on the incomes of households of participants and nonparticipants. Multiple determinants typically affect the role of smallholder farmers in raising sheep production. Conclusion. Future initiatives under a successful policy should aim at accelerating agricultural and rural growth by efficiently leveraging enhanced sheep capacity in particular in the study region and Ethiopia in general.

TI  - Promises and perils of collective land tenure in promoting urban resilience: Learning from China's urban villages
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - New frameworks for "urban resilience" frequently overlook the role of property rights and tenure security in shaping vulnerability, as well as how different property rights regimes shape societal capacity to adapt to environmental and developmental disruptions. We contribute to these discussions by examining how collective urban land tenure affects community-scale resilience, defined as environmental wellbeing, productive livelihoods, and empowered governance. We use urban villages in Shenzhen to study how this widespread phenomenon of collective land ownership in Chinese cities allowed rural villagers to adapt as cities spread around them over time. Drawing on a literature review, interviews, and a field visit to Shenzhen, we find that collective tenure in Shenzhen's urban villages has helped them avoid some of the limitations seen in household-level tenure formalization efforts elsewhere. Collective tenure enabled rural villages to create self-governance mechanisms that allowed them to transform individual and collective assets into vibrant, well-serviced, and mixed-use neighborhoods. Urban villages house most of Shenzhen's residents and have helped underwrite the region's industrialization process. However, collective tenure also has hindered integration with Shenzhen's urban infrastructure, governance, and taxation systems, resulted in astronomical profits for village elites, and repeated historic patterns of unequal land ownership in China. The promises and perils of collective urban property rights seen in Shenzhen call for research on other such models around the world to further inform whether and how such property rights regimes can support equitable and holistic notions of urban resilience.

TI  - The Temporal Evolution of Anthropogenic Phosphorus Consumption in China and Its Environmental Implications
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Modern human activities greatly disturb substance flows in nature and senselessly discard massive amounts of precious resources to natural waste reservoirs; phosphorus (P) is a good example of this. In this article, substance flow analysis is employed to quantify and explore the temporal evolution of China's P consumption in main metabolic nodes from 1984 to 2008, and then the environmental implications for P flows into both surface waters and natural soil are investigated. Results show that the metabolic nodes of human life and animal husbandry have demanded increasingly more P inputs, while disseminating more and more P wastes, with the waste recycling ratios of these processes dropping, respectively, from 65.9% and 66.1% in 1984 to 50.7% and 40.6% by 2008. These change traits were closely related to national polices including the Household Contract Responsibility System and the Shopping Basket Program, as well as the policy vacuum existing between China's agricultural and environmental administration departments. To achieve high crop yield, increasingly more inorganic P fertilizers have been utilized in China, but their use efficiency has decreased by 46.3%. From 2003 to 2008, the total P load into surface waters was stabilized at about 900.0 kilotons (kt), while the total P load into natural soil increased by more than 3.8 times to 3,131.3 kt P in 2008. City life and the intensive breeding of crops are identified as the main targets for further pollution control and nutrient recycling in China. Some suggestions for achieving environmentally sound practices and resource sustainability in China are proposed at the end of this article.

TI  - Productivity effects of land rental market operation in Ethiopia: evidence from a matched tenant-landlord sample
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - As countries increasingly strive to transform their economies from agriculture-based into a diversified one, land rental will become of greater importance. It will thus be critical to complement research on the efficiency of specific land rental arrangements such as sharecropping with an inquiry into the broader productivity impacts of the land rental market. Plot-level data for a matched landlord-tenant sample in an environment where sharecropping dominates allow us to explore both issues. We find that pure output sharing leads to significantly lower levels of efficiency that can be attenuated by monitoring while the inefficiency disappears if inputs are shared as well. Rentals transfer land to more productive producers but realization of this productivity advantage is prevented by the inefficiency of contractual arrangements, suggesting changes that would prompt adoption of different contractual arrangements could have significant benefits.

TI  - Can Environmental Risk Management Improve the Adaptability of Farmer Households' Livelihood Strategies? --Evidence From Hubei Province, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - With the rising temperature, uneven precipitation and frequent occurrence of extreme weather caused by global climate change, agricultural production is facing more severe challenges. Based on the sustainable livelihoods framework, this paper measures the index of farmer households' livelihood strategy adaptability and analyzes the benefits of farmer households' environmental risk management on livelihood strategy adaptability by using microscopic research data of 970 farmer households' livelihoods in Hubei Province, China, in 2020. This paper found that the farmer households' environmental risk management variables have a significant impact on the adaptability of farmer households' livelihood strategies, with the stronger the farmer households' environmental risk management capacity, the more adaptable its livelihood strategy. The impact of farmer households' environmental risk management variables on livelihood strategies varies for farmer households with different income levels. Therefore, this paper proposes that we should improve farmers' perception of climate change, promote the diffusion of adaptive technologies, improve agricultural insurance policies, give full play to the collective role of village collectives, companies and cooperatives, and promote the transformation and upgrading of livelihood approaches to further improve the adaptability of livelihood strategies.

TI  - Predicting carbon benefits from climate-smart agriculture: High-resolution carbon mapping and uncertainty assessment in El Salvador
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Agroforestry management in smallholder agriculture can provide climate change mitigation and adaptation benefits and has been promoted as 'climate-smart agriculture' (CSA), yet has generally been left out of international and voluntary carbon (C) mitigation agreements. A key reason for this omission is the cost and uncertainty of monitoring C at the farm scale in heterogeneous smallholder landscapes. A largely overlooked alternative is to monitor C at more aggregated scales and develop C contracts with groups of land owners, community organizations or C aggregators working across entire landscapes (e.g., watersheds, communities, municipalities, etc.). In this study we use a 100-km(2) agricultural area in El Salvador to demonstrate how high-spatial resolution optical satellite imagery can be used to map aboveground woody biomass (AGWB) C at the landscape scale with very low uncertainty (95% probability of a deviation of less than 1%). Uncertainty of AGWB-C estimates remained low (<5%) for areas as small as 250 ha, despite high uncertainties at the farm and plot scale (34-99%). We estimate that CSA adoption could more than double AGWB-C stocks on agricultural lands in the study area, and that utilizing AGWB-C maps to target denuded areas could increase C gains per unit area by 46%. The potential value of C credits under a plausible adoption scenario would range from $38,270 to $354,000 yr(-1) for the study area, or about $13 to $124 ha(-1) yr(-1), depending on C prices. Considering farm sizes in smallholder landscapes rarely exceed 1-2 ha, relying solely on direct C payments to farmers may not lead to widespread CSA adoption, especially if farm-scale monitoring is required. Instead, landscape-scale approaches to C contracting, supported by satellite-based monitoring methods such as ours, could be a key strategy to reduce costs and uncertainty of C monitoring in heterogeneous smallholder landscapes, thereby incentivizing more widespread CSA adoption.

TI  - How Does Social Embeddedness Affect Farmers' Adoption Behavior of Low-Carbon Agricultural Technology? Evidence From Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Agricultural carbon emissions, which are the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in China, not only place great pressure on emission reduction but also seriously affect food security and sustainable development of agriculture. As farmers are the direct users of cultivated land and the main adopters of agricultural technology, their adoption behavior of low-carbon agricultural technology directly determines its promotion and subsequent emissions reduction. It is of great theoretical and practical significance to analyze farmers' adoption behavior of low-carbon agricultural technology and their influencing factors. Based on social embeddedness theory and the survey data of 688 farmers in Jiangsu Province, this study applied a logistic model to analyze the impact of government support, farmers' cognition, social capital, personal characteristics, and family characteristics on farmers' adoption behavior of low-carbon agricultural technology. The results showed that (1) only 58.72% of farmers have adopted such a technology, which needs to be further improved; (2) government support and farmers' cognition had significantly positive influences on farmers' adoption behavior; (3) social capital is an important factor affecting farmers' adoption decisions, where social trust, networks, and norms play a significant role in promoting the adoption of low-carbon agricultural technology; and (4) party membership and household-contracted farmland area also had positive influences on farmers' adoption behavior of low-carbon technology. Therefore, to continue developing low-carbon agriculture, it is recommended to further strengthen government support, raise the price of low-carbon agricultural products, strengthen environmental supervision, and build a social embedded environment according to local conditions, and further improve farmers' social trust, enrich social networks, improve social norms, and give full play to the guiding and exemplary role of social capital. Additionally, it is also recommended to reinforce education and training to raise farmers' awareness regarding low-carbon agricultural technology, thereby guiding them to actively adopt these technologies.

TI  - Effects of quality coffee production on smallholders' adaptation to climate change in Yirgacheffe, Southern Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper was to assess the effects of quality coffee production on climate change adaptation using household surveys and interview data gathered from coffee farmers in Yirgacheffe, southern Ethiopia. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 352 households, stratified into conventional coffee farmers 232 (66%) and specialty coffee producers 120(34%), was used. The propensity score model for participating in quality coffee production was estimated using 14 covariates, and the impact of quality coffee production on adaptation to climate change adaptation was examined. The results are augmented with qualitative data collected through focus group discussions and key informant interviews held with randomly selected smallholder farmers. A telecoupling theoretical perspective was used to understand the link between coffee farmers' adaptation practices and the demand for quality coffee, as coffee is a global commodity. Findings The PSM analysis reveals that quality coffee production positively influences climate change adaptation. This implies that conventional coffee producers would have performed better in adaptation to climate change if they had participated in quality coffee production. The results of group discussions also confirm the positive effects of quality coffee production on adaptation to climate change, which also suggests a positive spillover effects for sustainable coffee farm management. Practical implications This study suggests enhancing quality coffee production is essential if a more sustainable and climate change resilient coffee livelihood is envisioned. Originality/value Though many studies are available on adaptation to climate change in general, this study is one of the few studies focusing on the effects of quality coffee production on climate change adaptation by smallholders in one of the least developed countries, Ethiopia. This study provides a better understanding of the importance of adaptation strategies specific to coffee production, which in turn help develop a more resilient coffee sector, as coffee production is one of the most sensitive activity to climate change.

TI  - Preferences for tree fruit market attributes among smallholder farmers in Eastern Rwanda
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - The increasing demand for high-value agricultural products such as fresh fruit presents opportunities for farmers in developing countries due to their higher market value compared with traditional staple crops. This study uses data on trust, risk, and time preferences obtained through behavioral experiments, combined with a discrete choice experiment to understand their effect on farmers' choices of marketing attributes, collecting data from 252 farmers from Eastern Rwanda. The results reveal that farmers, overall, have positive attitudes toward collective marketing channels with guaranteed immediate payments, written contracts, provision of inputs, credit, and training, a personal relationship with a buyer, and low investment costs. Additionally, farmers with lower levels of risk aversion were found to have a greater preference for immediate payment than farmers with higher levels of risk aversion. Farmers with higher future orientation are more likely to choose contracts that guarantee inputs and/or services and written contracts, and they attach lower relative importance to immediate payments than farmers with lower future orientation. Farmers with higher trust levels attach lower relative importance to immediate payments, written contracts, and a personal relationship with a buyer than farmers with lower trust levels.

TI  - Complementary feeding practices and associated factors among mothers of children aged 6-23 months in Ethiopia: Secondary data analysis of Ethiopian mini demographic and health survey 2019
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background Optimal nutrition in early child's life plays a vital role in improving mental and motor development, reduces the possibility of contracting various infectious diseases and related deaths, decreases the risk of obesity, and fosters better overall development. However, 45% of deaths in children under five years of age that occur globally is attributed to nutrition-related factors and the majority of these deaths occur in low-and middle-income countries. Therefore, this study aims to assess complementary feeding practices and associated factors among mothers of children aged 6-23 months in Ethiopia. Method The study used the Ethiopian mini demographic and health survey 2019 data. A two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique was used to select 1465 mothers of children aged 6-23 months in Ethiopia. Two-level multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model analysis was computed, and variables with p-value of less than 5% and an adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval in the final model were reported as statistically significant factors with appropriate complementary feeding practice. Result The overall prevalence of appropriate complementary feeding practice among mothers of children aged 6-23 months was 9.76%. In our study, mothers who attended primary[AOR = 2.72; 95%CI: 1.47-5.01], secondary[AOR = 2.64; 95%CI: 1.18-5.92] and higher school[AOR = 5.39; 95%CI: 2.29-12.64], being from medium income household[AOR = 2.89; 95%CI: 1.41-5.92], attended 1-3 times ANC visits in index pregnancy[AOR = 0.41; 95%CI: 0.18-0.89], mothers who have 12-17 months[AOR = 1.96; 95%CI: 1.16-3.33] and 18-23 months old children[AOR = 2.61; 95%CI: 1.49-4.54], currently breastfeeding mothers[AOR = 3.69; 95%CI: 1.73-7.91], mothers from pastoralist contextual regions[AOR = 0.29; 95%CI: 0.09-0.91], and mothers who have resided in rural areas[AOR = 0.49; 95%CI: 0.25-0.97] were factors significantly associated with appropriate complementary feeding practice. Conclusion This study showed low prevalence of appropriate complementary feeding practice. Therefore, the concerned health authorities need to strengthen the existing approaches designed for provision of nutrition education particularly targeting mothers who are unschooled, who have 6-11 months old children, live in pastoralist regions and reside in rural parts of the country, and create strategies that improve maternal job opportunities.

TI  - Study on illness perceptions of Chinese rural-dwelling adults with hypertension: A descriptive study
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING
AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to describe the levels of illness perception and identify interrelations among the variables of illness perception, demographic, and health-related characteristics in a sample of rural Chinese adults with hypertension (HTN). Design This is a cross-sectional descriptive study using descriptive and correlation analysis. Sample It included 163 people diagnosed with HTN for at least 3 years who lived in two rural villages in Zhejiang Province of mainland China during 2014-2015. Measurements Illness perception was measured by the Chinese Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised. Demographic and illness characteristics were collected by the researcher. Weight, height, and blood pressure (BP) were, respectively, measured by calibrated scale and digital sphygmomanometers. Results The findings showed that the BP control rate was 28.80% in the village. The highest average item score found in timeline (3.98 +/- 0.76) and control (3.29 +/- 0.67) subscales indicated that rural Chinese adults believe in the chronicity and controllability of HTN. Negative illness representation presented the lowest mean item score (2.64) suggesting that the participants neither perceive symptom variation of the illness nor their illness as serious. Interrelations existed among the illness perception variables with variation from that in other previous study. The cause of HTN was attributed to balance factors, psychological factors, risk factors, and cultural factors in sequence. Age, education, body mass index, and household annual income were correlated with illness perception. Conclusion These findings suggested that misconceptions about HTN perception existed among rural adults in the villages. Comprehensive health education program is needed to increase rural adults' knowledge and management of HTN.

TI  - The Effects of Diminished Tourism Arrivals and Expenditures Caused by Terrorism and Political Unrest on the Kenyan Economy
T2  - ECONOMIES
AB  - The economic development of many countries globally relies heavily on tourism arrivals and spending. Terrorist attacks, political unrest, and other external shocks create disruptions and imbalances that lead to tourism crises with devastating effects on a country's economy. The paper quantitatively examines the wider economic impacts and welfare effects of a continued decrease in tourism revenues caused by terrorism and political instability on the Kenyan economy. We use a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium model which we calibrate to a 2003 Social Accounting Matrix for Kanya. Our results reveal that a decrease in tourism spending causes a contraction of the economy in the short-term and long-term. Tourism contraction leads to decreased output, prices and wages in urban households, whereas the rural households notice an increase in welfare in the short and medium-term and a decrease in the long-term. Diversification of the tourism product, better branding, crisis management preparations and emphasis on domestic tourism that is less affected by disruption are ways to safeguard tourism in Kenya and beyond.

TI  - Adoption of new technologies by smallholder farmers: the contributions of extension, research institutes, cooperatives, and access to cash for improving tef production in Ethiopia
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - Agricultural intensification and extensification are standard responses to ecological and economic vulnerability among smallholder communities. Climate change has exacerbated this vulnerability and thrown the complexity of and critical need for managing a healthy natural resource base while increasing on-farm productivity into sharp light. Sustainable intensification is one of many mechanisms for accomplishing this balancing act. This study examines the adoption of sustainable intensification practices, namely input packages focused on tef row planting-designed to boost yield and promote more efficient use of inputs. This study utilized a mix methods approach to survey 115 smallholder farmers in the South Wollo zone of the Amhara region in Ethiopia. This study found that cash and capital, more so than contact with the AIS, influenced farmers' decisions to adopt row planting input packages. Khat production was an important source of cash for inputs and was more likely to be available to farmers with irrigation schemes. Long-term, farmers who cultivate khat may not successfully engage in SI, as khat replaces traditional food crop production in the region. Yet, for farmers who do not grow khat, long-term investment in SI practices is unlikely unless access to affordable credit options is improved.

TI  - Challenges to "going local": Lessons from direct food sourcing initiatives in Cusco, Peru
T2  - TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY RESEARCH
AB  - Restaurants can improve the quality and reliability of their input supplies and gain favor with consumers through direct sourcing while also contributing to development goals around sustainable production and income generation. However, limited evidence exists on the willingness of restaurants to invest in direct sourcing, the implications of these linkages, and the options to achieve scale. We interviewed 46 restaurants to examine their preferences and experiences in sourcing local foods and analyzed three cases that link local production to the tourist sector in Cusco, Peru. Results suggest that the interventions succeeded in providing a few restaurants with high value food. However, the interventions failed to deliver impact at scale. Bottlenecks included low business capacities in farmer organizations, limited support from NGOs and the government, and weak incentives for restaurants. We conclude with a discussion on the changes needed in the business and policy environment for achieving greater impact at scale.

TI  - Altruistic Preference and Crime Perception
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - We propose a static model of agriculture household behaviour and incorporate two behavioural aspects in it-namely altruistic tendencies and perceptions related to crime. We use a game theoretic framework, based upon the standard agricultural household model proposed by Singh et al. (World Bank Econ Rev 1:149-179, 1986) which is well suited for a rural agricultural setting in a developing country like India. The results of the model show that altruism deters perception of crime in regions with comparatively low expenditure on crime reducing activities, and vice-versa. We empirically test the results of the theoretical model by using the India Human Development Survey-II for the year 2011-2012. The instrumental variable regression results validate our main hypothesis affirming the potential role of social capital in crime mitigation for states with weaker institutions.

TI  - Outpatient and Inpatient Service Use by Chinese Adults Living in Rural Low-Income Households
T2  - SOCIAL WORK IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - This study applied the Andersen Model of Health Care Utilization to explore the variables associated with health service use among Chinese adults living in rural low-income households. A survey of 2,429 adults living in 787 low-income households in Jiangsu, China was conducted in 2017. Respondents were asked the presence of outpatient service in the past one month and the amount of hospitalization in the past one year. Mixed effect logistic and negative binomial models were used to examine the relationship of individual-level and household-level characteristics with health service use. Health condition was the predominant determinant of both outpatient and inpatient service use (Odds Ratio [OR] >1,p< .001). Individuals living in a poor household were less likely to use outpatient service (OR = 0.05, 95% confidence interval CI: 0.00, 0.71), and the longer in poverty status the less likely to use outpatient service (OR = 0.92, CI: 0.86, 0.99). Age was associated with a lower likelihood to use outpatient service (OR = 0.93, CI: 0.93, 1.00), and this relationship was stronger for larger households (OR = 1.01, CI: 1.00, 1.01). For inpatient service use, most household-level measures were insignificant. Rural Chinese health service use was influenced primarily by needs variables. Outpatient service use was constrained by household enabling variables. Older adults were at a disadvantage of using outpatient service when the family prioritized younger members in allocating resources. These results suggest the need for policy advocacy to expand insurance reimbursement and improve benefits for poor older adults.

TI  - Financial risks in Rwandan smallholder broiler production
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to determine the stochastic net present value (NPV) of a model smallholder poultry operation in Rwanda under production and market uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach A discounted cash flow calculator was used to determine the NPV of operator investments and operating cash flows, including time, materials and capital. Broiler production data, market prices and variable input costs were collected from 125 smallholder operations in the Musanze District, Rwanda. These data were combined with a historical price index tracking the inflation rate of Rwanda's currency. Policies including overstocking, technical support repayment scheduling, selling broilers at a spot market price, using marketing contracts and selling poultry manure were compared using non-parametric paired comparisons and stochastic dominance. Findings Risk-neutral and risk-averse producers would prefer overstocking, delaying repayment of technical support services and selling manure to status quo operational policy. No differences were observed between the option to sell birds at spot market prices or through contracts. Research limitations/implications - This analysis demonstrates how individual managerial or an intervention in smallholder broiler production affects financial performance. Practical implications - To mitigate risk associated with this novel enterprise, producers should consider overstocking birds. If local markets for manure were developed, the risks faced by new or beginning poultry operators could be mitigated. Originality/value A stochastic, discounted cash flow model calculator was used to determine the NPV and discounted payback period of operator investments and operating cash flows, including time, materials and capital.

TI  - Property rights integrity, tenure security and forestland rental market participation: Evidence from Jiangxi Province, China
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
AB  - The decentralization of property rights is the focus of the forest tenure reforms in several developing countries. In China, it was achieved by the launch of a new round of collective forest tenure reform beginning in 2003, which provided farmers with more integrated and secure forestland rights. Drawing on household data collected in Jiangxi province in 2011 and 2013, this paper examines the impacts of households' recognition of property rights and improved tenure security on forestland rental activities. Our empirical results show that households with higher perceptions of more complete use rights and mortgage rights have a lower probability and intensity of renting-in land, while households with lower expectations of future forestland redistribution or expropriation are more likely to rent in forestland and more of it. These results imply that the development of a forestland rental market leading to better forest management requires an integrated forestland management approach consisting of decentralization of property rights and village governance. In particular, the central government may further clarify the rights and obligations affiliated to forestland ownership, contractual rights, and management rights; while the village collective may shift from direct intervention in the integrity and security of forestland rights to the supervision and protection of decentralized forestland rights to increase efficiency from the decentralization of property rights.

TI  - Discovering the practices of palm oil smallholders' cooperative business models in Malaysia
T2  - GEOGRAFIA-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY & SPACE
AB  - Smallholder cooperatives were created as an initiative to empower the socio-economic welfare of smallholders and reduce reliance on outsiders. The lesser the dependence on external parties will increase the aspiration and preserves the interests of smallholders. This is because cooperative movements are the collective effort of individuals of equal background that aims to safeguard mutual interest. The objective of this study is to identify and describe the cooperative models involving smallholders in Malaysia. Interview techniques were used to carry out the data collection process. The informants comprise of the representatives of the board or management of six cooperatives related to palm oil smallholder. The selection of cooperatives was made using a purposive sampling method where the potential informants were chosen based on the list of cooperatives involved in the palm oil sector. The study findings summarize three forms of cooperative business models comprised of smallholders in Malaysia namely the smallholder cooperatives model of FELDA and FELCRA agencies and the models of independent planters. These three cooperative models have the core principle of cooperative implementation that is to safeguard the interests of its members. Based on the three identified models, the cooperative practices is found to be focuses on entrepreneurial activities, risk reduction and optimization of profits. All of these practices are to help members to earn benefits in the form of dividend income, information sharing and knowledge accumulation. An understanding of the existing cooperative models in Malaysia can help streamline current operation management practices to ensure delivery of effective and sustainable benefits to its members.

TI  - Adoption and preferences for coffee drought index-based insurance in Uganda
T2  - STUDIES IN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Micro-insurance can be an effective approach to smoothening income in adverse times and potentially a way to contribute to the financial inclusion of vulnerable populations. However, direct sales to individual smallholders remains a challenging task without an easily scalable solution. The current research seeks to find the determinants of adoption of a stand-alone coffee index-based insurance product in Uganda marketed by a farmer cooperative, and elicited preferences for improving the design and delivery model. A stratified household survey was conducted among 614 farmers, of which 40% adopted insurance and 62% were member of a farmer cooperative. In odds ratio terms, adopters perceived themselves to be 3.09 times more likely to receive a pay-out than non-adopters (P<0.01), and those having better access to extension services were 2.47 times more likely to adopt a policy (P<0.01). Yet farmers perceiving the design as complex were approximately half as likely to adopt (P<0.05). Farmers preferred the option of premium payments proceeds on delivery, mobile premium payments and delivering insurance through cooperatives/associations. Deepening insurance uptake among coffee farmers will therefore require a strong focus on communication and information sharing facilitated by cooperatives/associations (e.g. farmer cooperates, village and saving associations, or women's associations).

TI  - Appraisal of WaSH (Water-Sanitation-Hygiene) Infrastructure using a Composite Index, Spatial Algorithms and Sociodemographic Correlates in Rural India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Rationale: A great wealth of studies expound on the impact of water and sanitation facilities on sustainable human development. But even though water-sanitation nexus is acknowledged in WaSH (Water-Sanitation-Hygiene) literature, they are seldom assessed collectively. In rural India, open defecation is still a major threat to human health, as much as potable water quality. Unfortunately, no study yet exists that attempts to assess the WaSH sector in a holistic sense. Objective: Present study was aimed to integrate multiple WaSH parameters into a composite WaSH Quality Index (WaSHQI) for rural India, within a geospatial framework, and understand potential effects of different sociodemographic factors that are likely to influece WaSH profile development. Methods: District-wise data for (i) within-premises latrine facility, (ii) water source type (safe/treated tap), (iii) water source location (near home/away from home), and (iv) wastewater drainage (closed/open) were mapped at nationwide scale. Gini Coefficients were computed for each parameter to elucidate spatial inequality. The parameters were integrated in various combinations to compute a composite index for each district called, WaSHQI. In the process, four hypothetical scenarios were generated (grading from most conservative to most liberal). The WaSHQI was later (a) merged with spatial algorithms (Moran's I and LISA)) to identify WaSH-hotspots and (b) correlated with a range of sociodemographic factors (e.g., literacy, household density, caste). Results: Under a conservative aproach (presumably the most hygienic WaSH scenario), a vast expanse through central India were significantly (p < 0.001) lagging in multiple WaSH facilities and appeared as major hotspots that deserve urgent management actions. On the other hand, northwestern states (Punjab and Haryana) registered a better WaSH profile owing to a number of progressive social reforms. Significant (p < 0.01) correlations between the WaSHQI and literacy levels, especially that of female, in the hotspots called for more in-depth region-specific investigations in future. Rural WaSH sector in India is marked by intense spatial inequality/heterogeneity, calling for spatially-optimized interventions. Using multiple geospatial alrorithms and statistical analyses the study demonstrated the spatially interconnected nature of the WaSH and argued that policy decisions have to address the parameters collectively. Future Implications: WaSHQI can offer the decision-makers a semi-quantitative approximation of overall WaSH infrastructural inadequacy at any level of administrative hierarchy anywhere in the world. However, some efforts to exapand/diversify the potentials WaSHQI (accounting for additional socioeconomic parameters) could be pursued on the premise of developing a WaSH informatics system to track regional progress/lag over time.

TI  - Land transfer, collective action and the adoption of soil and water conservation measures in the Loess Plateau of China
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
AB  - Based on the data of 849 rural households in the Loess Plateau of China, this paper uses exploratory factor analysis to study farmers' participation in collective action from the aspects of information, participation, organization and effect of action. Through Bootstrap mediation effect test, this paper investigates the direct and indirect impacts of land transfer area and period on the soil and water conservation measures of farmers, respectively. The results show that the area of land transfer directly affects the use of terraced fields, plastic film and afforestation, but not the use of water-saving irrigation techniques. The transfer period has a significant direct impact on the adoption of the four measures mentioned above. Although the mediating effect of collective action in the process of land transfer area affecting the use of terraced fields, afforestation and water-saving irrigation techniques is significant, it is not significant on the use of plastic film. The mediating effect of collective action in the process of land transfer period affecting the use of terraced fields and water-saving irrigation techniques is significant, while it is not significant on the use of plastic film and afforestation.

TI  - Resource Symbiosis Model through bricolage: A livelihood generation assessment of an Indian village
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - In this study, a conceptual model of resource symbiosis (RSM) of an Indian village was developed, by leveraging the concept of bricolage, to aid in sustainable livelihood generation. This novel RSM expands as a co-management model for a rural community in resource-constrained environments to manage its resources efficiently in collaboration with local governments. Avenues for sustainable livelihood generation was assessed through household surveys and resource mapping of the village. A mixed-mode research method was adopted through participatory rural appraisal activities for involving local people and their practices in the design philosophy of RSM. Problem identification and ranking through personal and collective interviews of the villagers formed a core basis for the livelihood assessment. It enabled the internalisation of normative and idiosyncratic linkages for resource symbiosis. These linkages were interconnected through community participation, which set the boundary conditions for RSM. Results show that RSM for the study village could foster inclusive growth in two ways: first, by creating scope for efficient resource utilisation through the establishment of an oil mill, a biogas plant and a milk processing unit; and, second, by creating an entrepreneurial ecosystem based on village's selfsufficiency and market demand by empowering local entrepreneurs. Additionally, RSM could leverage local governing bodies to connect with private investors and policymakers to enable fast-track implementation of the livelihood generation schemes of the government.

TI  - Farmers' perception of agricultural cooperatives: the case of Sanliurfa, Turkey
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
AB  - Sanliurfa is the province with the third-largest agricultural area in Turkey. However, it has only 0.62% of the total number of cooperatives in the country. This study aimed to determine the perceptions of farmers in Sanliurfa regarding agricultural cooperatives and the factors affecting them. The main research material was obtained through face-to-face surveys involving farmers in Sanliurfa selected by a simple random sampling method. The sampling volume was determined with a 95% confidence limit and a 5% error margin. Multiple regression analysis was used in Stata software. According to the results of the research, 39.7% of the participants were cooperative members and more than half of them were not active members. Of the participants, 30.3% had a positive perception of cooperatives, 36.82% were undecided, and 32.88% had negative opinions. Age, marital status, non-agricultural income, experience, social security, farmer registration system, cooperative membership, and land variables positively affected farmers' perceptions. However, the variables of education, income, and union membership had negative effects on farmers' perceptions. No statistically significant relationship was reported between a farmer's perception and any of the following variables: the number of people that make up the farmer's household, the number of individuals engaged in agriculture and non-agricultural work in the family, and the status of the farmer's lease. Conceptual, local, cultural, educational, and structural problems related to cooperatives exist in Sanliurfa.These issues need to be given more attention by the public. This research is the first study on this subject to be conducted in Sanliurfa.

TI  - Human Capital, Social Capital and Economic Recovery of Ecological Immigrants: The Empirical Study on the Middle Route Project of South-to-North Water Transfer
T2  - EKOLOJI
AB  - The Middle Route Project of South-to-North Water Transfer is the major water conservancy project that effectively alleviates water shortages in Beijing, Tianjin and North China. The construction of the project involves many problems such as reservoir resettlement and ecological environment construction. In particular, the human capital, social capital and economic recovery in ecological migration are the current controversial issues. Based on the sample survey data of the immigrants in the middle line reservoir area of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project, the "people-oriented" core idea is to analyze the feasibility of ecological migration. Interventional poverty is used as an analytical framework to study the poverty problems brought about by ecological migration and the impact of human capital and social capital on the ecological migration economy. The multivariate linear regression model with human capital and social capital as independent variables and household economic income as the dependent variable is used to analyze the impact of human capital and social capital on the economic recovery of immigrant families in different relocation stages. The empirical research results show that after the relocation of the South-to-North Water Diversion Middle Line Project, the improvement of human capital and social capital on the economic income in the process of economic recovery has failed; compared with local farmers, the average age, the level of education, the number of migrant workers and the farthest footprint of the family labor force in the immigrant human capital are no longer significant factors affecting household income. Factors such as communication costs, professional cooperative associations, and the level of participation in collective affairs of social capital no longer have an explanatory effect on household economic income. With the adaptation to the local environment, some of the factors in human capital and social capital have restored the economic recovery of immigrant families. In social capital, the effects of macro-social capital are restored, and the effects of micro-social capital are still not restored, mainly because the migration of immigrants has caused great damage to the micro-social capital of farmers.

TI  - Youth's participation in agriculture: A fallacy or achievable possibility? Evidence from rural South Africa
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES
AB  - Background: The realisation of more youth involvement in the agricultural sector has proved to be elusive, so the question of the possibility of a youth-led agriculture needs further investigation.
   Aim: The aim of the study was to assess whether there is potential for the rural youth to participate in agriculture by employing the typology formulation approach.
   Setting: The study is premised on recent calls for strategies to reduce youth unemployment in sub-Saharan Africa by involving and enhancing the agricultural sector.
   Method: A survey in questionnaire form was conducted with 224 youths from two districts in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The Principal Components Analysis and K-Means Clustering were performed to determine the youth typologies and assess their potential.
   Results: Five typologies were identified. Most youths (59.3%) were found in Typology 1 (those that see no benefits in farming) and in Typology 2 (older, experienced and with access to land). Typology 5 (male youths in agricultural cooperatives) had the lowest proportion of youths (5.7%). Participants in typologies 2, 3 and 5 were deemed to have high to moderate potential for successful engagement in farming. The highest potential was found in the typology with the least percentage of youths.
   Conclusions: The typologies showed that youths have varying perceptions and aspirations regarding agriculture. While some show an interest and have the potential to participate in farming, others do not. Therefore, the blanket notion of the youth's lack of interest in agriculture should be qualified as it does not always hold. The heterogeneity in characteristics among the youths in these typologies, including their potential to participate in agriculture, expresses the differences in the kinds of support needed to increase their participation.

TI  - Protected Areas Fund Rural Household Dispersal to Urban Areas in Riverine Amazonia
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
AB  - Multi-sited householdswhich straddle rural and urban realmsare increasingly prevalent in riverine Amazonia. Although research on this collective livelihood strategy has focussed on the consequences for tropical forests, less attention has been given to riverine people's welfare, or the fish and aquatic resources on which they often depend. Based on research conducted in protected area communities and a major urban centre in the Peruvian Amazon, we detail the sources and forms of capital on which dispersed households draw to jointly make a living. Our findings show that natural capital (specifically fisheries resources) drawn from in and around the Pacaya Samiria National Reserve plays a critical role in facilitating and sustaining household dispersal to urban areas through both direct consumption and nature-human capital substitution. These results indicate that meeting social, economic, and environmental sustainability targets on Amazonian floodplains requires accounting for human mobility and diversified livelihoods across expansive geographic areas.

TI  - Testing participation constraints in contract design for sustainable soil conservation in Ethiopia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper focuses on contract design to improve the incentive structure of current coordination mechanisms related to sustainable land use management in the Ethiopian highlands. The main objective is to assess whether, and if so under which terms and conditions, rural households are willing to enter into contractual agreements to invest in soil conservation measures on their land. Participation constraints are tested under different soil erosion and institutional-economic conditions in a choice experiment targeting 750 rural households. We show that contracts provided by local government peasant associations offering additional credit, land use security and extension services could be an effective means to increase the share of farmers implementing soil conservation measures. However, trust in contract terms and conditions appears to play an important role. Farmers living in the most erosion prone areas are most likely to participate, while farmers taking soil conservation measures already are less likely to enter into a contractual agreement with the local government. Farmers not taking soil conservation measures will only do so if the contract price is lower than or equal to the income losses suffered from soil erosion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Production under input endogeneity and farm-specific risk aversion: evidence from contract farming and Bayesian method
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Contract farming (CF) has been offered as a solution to missing markets in developing economies. However, little is known as to how the presence of CF affects production risk, technical efficiency and risk attitudes of the smallholder. This study investigates production risk, technical efficiency, output price uncertainty and risk attitudes of contract and independent farmers. Using a Bayesian estimation method and farm-level data from Nepal, we find that contract farmers are more risk-averse than the independent farmers. Contract farmers can increase output by reducing the scale more than independent farmers. We find that labour and capital are risk-reducing, while land and other inputs are risk increasing for both contract and independent farmers. Finally, independent growers consistently over-predict output prices.

TI  - From innovation to adaptation: lessons from 20 years of the SHIFT forest management system in Sanming, China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study follows the 20-year period of a forestry innovation-the share-holding integrated forestry tenure (SHIFT) system-its adoption, diffusion, adaptation and transformation in Sanming Prefecture, Fujian Province of the People's Republic of China. Our research suggests that the adoption of this innovation in forest management institutions and technologies tends to follow the familiar "s" curve. However, the prevailing patterns in the social, economic, cultural, and biophysical environments that encouraged the adoption have changed overtime as it moved to an adaptive phase. The need for flexibility and resiliency in forestry strategies is necessary if the goals and objectives promised by innovation are to be sustained.
   SHIFT was initiated as an innovative rural development program of "private-like" forest management, where villagers became shareholders in the community forestry operation and obtained employment through a system of tenure contracts. SHIFT has proven to be an effective system for the regeneration and protection of Sanming's forests. Changing conditions in the social, economic, cultural, and biophysical environments of Sanming have undermined the value of the shareholding system and the benefit distribution of tenure contracts. However, villager confidence in the SHIFT system remains positive as direct dividend benefits have been replaced by those accrued through the harvest of non-timber forest products and a new household tenure contract to supply individual household forest product needs.

TI  - Impacts of tenancy arrangements on investment and efficiency: evidence from Pakistan
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - In this article, we use farm-level data from the Punjab Province in Pakistan to analyze the impact of three tenancy contracts on investment in soil-improving and productivity-enhancing measures and farm productivity. A multivariate tobit model that accounts for potential substitutability and complementarity of investment options, as well as endogeneity of tenure arrangements was employed in the empirical analysis. Our empirical results indicate that land tenure arrangements influence farmers decisions to invest in soil-improving and productivity-enhancing measures. In particular, owner-cultivators with secured tenancy arrangements were found to be more likely to invest in soil-improving and productivity-enhancing measures, compared to those on leased contracts. We also find that output per hectare was highest on land cultivated by owners and lowest on land under sharecropping tenancy, lending support to the Marshallian inefficiency hypothesis.

TI  - The subsidization of farming households in China's agriculture
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Concerned about national food self-sufficiency and rural household incomes, in 2004 China decided to reverse its longstanding policy of taxing farm households and instead began to provide them with subsidies. Since 2004, annual announcements have trumpeted rises in subsidies. Despite the historic turnaround of policy and likely implication of this subsidy policy to China's food economy, there has been little household level survey-based research that has sought to understand the nature of China's subsidy programs from the viewpoint of the farmer. Using data from two sets of household-based surveys (covering tens of thousands of households and most major producing provinces) and survey data from government, in this paper we examine the subsidies that are directly given to farmers, one of the newest and relatively high profiles components of China's subsidy programs. We focus on China's grain, input, seed, and machinery subsidy programs. According to the survey-based findings, we show that although agricultural subsidies per farm are low, on a per hectare basis the rate of subsidies is high. Almost all producers are receiving them. Subsidies are mostly being given to the land contractor, not the tiller. Most of grain, input and seed subsidies are non-distorting, but machinery subsidy is based on farmers' actual purchase of machineries. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - How Does Risk Management Improve Farmers' Green Production Level? Organic Fertilizer as an Example
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - With increases in the frequency of various natural and social risks, effectively coping with uncertainty is necessary for the sustainable development of individuals and the society, particularly smallholder farmers with vulnerable livelihoods. Using survey data from farmers in China, we constructed a risk management capability index system for farmers at the individual, collective, and government levels to empirically analyze the impact of risk management on green production behavior through the Heckman model for two-stage sample selection. The results showed that risk management is a key factor affecting green production behavior. Membership status (membership in an organization), government subsidies, and income levels significantly promote green production levels. Moreover, risk management not only directly affects the green production level but also promotes green production behavior by expanding the scale of operation, improving the sense of responsibility, and enhancing the behavioral responsibility. Additionally, the mediating effect of these factors on farmers in the low-risk perception group was more obvious. Therefore, the risk management level of farmers should be improved at the individual, collective, and government levels to promote sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Price risk perceptions and adoption of management strategies by smallholder rice farmers in Mbeya region, Tanzania
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - One of the main risks that tend to affect the profitability and well-being of smallholder rice farmers in Tanzania is volatile rice prices. Improving the capacity of farmers to manage price risks is essential to increase rural incomes. This article applies descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, and probit model to examine price risk management strategies of smallholders rice farmers, and factors affecting their use. Results have shown that most rice farmers prefer to manage price risk through spot market strategies, even though forward contracts perform better. The factors that significantly affected the adoption of the risk management tools were farm income, technological intensity, income diversification activities, access to market information, and storage facilities. Findings suggest that policies aimed at establishing and promoting commodity- derivative markets, improving market information systems, supporting the construction of warehouse facilities in rural areas, and improving access to credit for farmers could enhance farmers' ability to manage price risks. Governments can also set up price guarantee schemes to help farmers cope with the loss of income resulting from catastrophic events or major market disruptions.

This article reports on findings from a longitudinal study of how the program affected the use of health care services, out-of-pocket spending on medical care, and the operations and financial viability of China's township health centers, which constitute a middle tier of care in between village clinics and county hospitals. We found that between 2005 and 2008 the program provided some risk protection and increased the intensity of inpatient care at township health centers. Importantly, the program appears to have improved the centers' financial status. At the same time, the program did not increase the overall number of patients served or the likelihood that a sick person would seek care at a township center. These findings serve as a benchmark of the program's early impact. The results also suggest that the composition of health care use in China has changed, with people increasingly seeking outpatient care at village clinics and inpatient care at township health centers.

TI  - Farmers' Rural-To-Urban Migration, Influencing Factors and Development Framework: A Case Study of Sihe Village of Gansu, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Farmers are the major participants in rural development process and their willingness to settle in urban areas directly affects the implementation of rural revitalization strategy. Based on Ostrom's institutional analysis and development (IAD) framework, we analyzed farmers' willingness to settle in urban areas and its influencing factors by binary Logistic regression and cluster analysis of survey data of 190 rural households in Sihe village of Gansu Province of China. The results show that: (1) In Sihe village, farmers' willingness to settle in urban areas was low in general and influenced by their neighbors' decisions or behaviors. Households willing and unwilling to migrate to urban areas both presented significant spatial agglomeration. (2) The factors influencing farmers' willingness to settle in urban areas were analyzed from six aspects: individual characteristics, family characteristics, residence characteristics, cognitive characteristics, institutions, and constraints. The main influencing factors were found to be age, occupation, number of non-agricultural workers in the family, household cultivated land area, annual household income, house building materials, degree of satisfaction with social pension, homestead and contracted land subsidies, income constraints, and other constraints. (3) Individual heterogeneity and difference in economic basis determined the difference in farmers' willingness to settle in urban areas. Institutions and constraints played different roles in the migration willingness of different groups of farmers (Note: More details on the sample as well as further interpretation and discussion of the surveys are available in the associated research article (Village-Scale Livelihood Change and the Response of Rural Settlement Land Use: Sihe Village of Tongwei County in Mid-Gansu Loess Hilly Region as an Example (Ma, L.B.; Liu, S.C.; Niu, Y.W.; Chen, M.M., 2018)).

TI  - The Contractual Aesthetics of Sharecropping in Black Conceptualism
T2  - CRITICAL ARTS-SOUTH-NORTH CULTURAL AND MEDIA STUDIES
AB  - The impersonal legal language of contracts, termed the "aesthetic of administration" by Benjamin Buchloh, has had a strong impact on postwar conceptualist art. In the U.S., however, a two-tiered legal system explicitly existed from before the founding of the republic up through the end of Jim Crow, and, implicit in so-called "colorblind" legal discourse, continue to exist. Without claiming an exclusive status for Black conceptualist art, Black artists often employ a critical approach to the universalism assumed by the analytical ethos of conceptualism. Making use of text and performance, the works of artists Adrian Piper, Charles Gaines, William Pope.L, Glenn Ligon, and Cameron Rowland offer an archive of nuanced operationalised language. The hybrid practices of artists like Rick Lowe and Martine Syms spill over into curation, signalling an emphasis on administration as an avenue for accruing cultural capital. Black conceptual artists and Black curators can be framed within a history linked not to identity per se, but to a skepticism that expands and enriches the conceptualist tradition, while suggesting a need to transform systems by which cultural recognition is allocated.

TI  - How Do Women Overcome Gender Inequality by Forming Small-Scale Cooperatives? The Case of the Agricultural Sector in Uganda
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In Uganda, the agricultural sector contributes substantially to gross domestic product. Although the involvement of Ugandan women in this sector is extensive, female farmers face significant obstacles, caused by gendering that impedes their ability to expand their family business and to generate incomes. Gender refers to social or cultural categories by which women-men relationships are conceived. In this study, we aim to investigate how gendering influences the development of business relationships in the Ugandan agricultural sector. To do so, we employed a qualitative-inductive methodology to collect unique data on the rice and cassava sectors. Our findings reveal at first that, in the agricultural sector in Uganda, inter-organization business relationships (i.e., between non-family actors) are mostly developed by and between men, whereas intra-organization business relationships with family members are mostly developed by women. We learn that gendering impedes women from developing inter-organization business relationships. Impediments for female farmers include their restricted mobility, the lack of trust by men, their limited freedom in communication, household duties, and responsibilities for farming activities up until sales. Our findings also reveal that these impediments to developing inter-organization business relationships prevent female farmers from being empowered and from attainting economic benefits for the family business. In this context, the results of our study show that grouping in small-scale cooperatives offers female farmers an opportunity to overcome gender inequality and to become economically emancipated. Thanks to these cooperatives, women can develop inter-organization relationships with men and other women and gain easier access to financial resources. Small-scale cooperatives can alter gendering in the long run, in favor of more gender equality and less marginalization of women. Our study responds to calls for more research on the informal economy in developing countries and brings further understanding to the effect of gendering in the Ugandan agricultural sector. We propose a theoretical framework with eight propositions bridging gendering, business relationship development, and empowerment and economic benefits. Our framework serves as a springboard for policy implications aimed at fostering gender equality in informal sectors in developing countries.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors of intestinal parasites among children under two years of age in a rural area of Rutsiro district, Rwanda - a cross-sectional study
T2  - PAN AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated risk factors of intestinal parasite infections among children less than two years of age in Rutsiro, Rwanda. Methods: A cross-sectional parasitological survey was conducted in Rutsiro in June 2016. Fresh stool samples were collected from 353 children and examined using microscopy to detect parasite. A questionnaire was administered to collect data on hygiene, sanitation, socio-demographic and economic characteristics. Results: Approximately one in two children (44.8%) were found to be infected with at least one intestinal parasite. Ascaris (28.5%) was the most prevalent infection followed by Entamoeba histolytica (25.95%) and Giardia lamblia (19.6%). Infection with more than one pathogen was noted e.g. presence of Ascaris and yeasts (8.9%), and amoeba with Trichocephale (4.4%), respectively. Children from non-farming families were less likely to be at risk of intestinal parasite infections (AOR = 0.41, p = 0.028) compared to children from farming families. Children from households with access to treated drinking water were less likely to contract intestinal parasite infections (AOR = 0.44, p = 0.021) compared with those who used untreated water. Children from families with improved sources of water were twice as likely to be diagnosed with intestinal parasitoses compared to those who did not. We postulate that the majority of families (50.1%) who have access to improved water sources do not treat water before consumption. Conclusion: The high prevalence of intestinal parasitoses in children warrants strict control measures for improved sanitation, while treatment of drinking water should be considered.

TI  - Determinants of consanguinity and inbreeding coefficient in the multiethnic population of Mardan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan
T2  - ASIAN BIOMEDICINE
AB  - Background: Despite the high sociocultural preferences in contracting marriages among close relatives in Pakistan, marked regional differences exist in the prevalence of consanguinity. There is great interest to elucidate the sociodemographic variables underlying the heterogeneity in consanguinity prevalence in the various populations. The present study was conducted in the Mardan district of Pakistan, the second largest multiethnic Pashtun metropolis.
   Objective: To find determinants of consanguineous unions.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional study design, a convenience sample of 1,202 ever-married men from 3 tehsils of Mardan district was recruited in an unelected manner and data regarding their marital union types and sociodemographic variables were obtained by a structured interview. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used.
   Results: Consanguineous unions accounted for 44% of all marriages, and the inbreeding coefficient was calculated as 0.0258. Regression analyses revealed that 6 variables were significant predictors of consanguinity, namely, tehsil, age, year of marriage, caste (zaat/biradari) system, area of house, and marriage arrangement of the respondent, while 6 other variables, namely, rural/urban origin, literacy, occupation, monthly income, household type, and number of family members, were not found to be significant. Regression analyses showed that there were different combinations of variables predictive of consanguinity among the various tehsils.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of consanguinity in the Mardan district was found to be lower than that in many other districts of Pakistan. National regional differences exist in consanguinity, and the combination of predictive factors varies greatly.

TI  - Normative, livelihood, and demographic influences on enrollment in a payment for ecosystem services program
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Payment for ecosystem services (PES) has emerged as a leading conservation mechanism worldwide, and its success depends largely on landholders' willingness to enroll in and comply with these programs. Researchers have suggested program duration and perceived social norms may influence enrollment, but empirical evidence is sparse. There is also conflict over the influence of other socioeconomic, demographic, and farm characteristics. This study, based in Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve in southwestern China, uses a choice experiment and mixed-effects model to quantify how payment level, duration of program, social norms, and demographic and economic factors affect farmers' willingness to enroll in a PES program. Results suggest higher neighbor participation increases willingness to enroll, as does higher payment level, but contract duration does not. Other factors associated with higher enrollment include being allowed to plant economically productive trees, having lower educational attainment, having local off-farm work, owning no livestock, and not having lived in one's current neighborhood since birth. These results suggest PES implementers may improve enrollment by targeting households with these conducive characteristics and by utilizing tree species with sellable products like tea and herbs. Moreover, results suggest implementers may improve enrollment by emphasizing neighbors' enrollment while recruiting new participants, thereby capitalizing on perceived social norms.

TI  - Contract Farming and Technical Efficiency: A Case of Export-Oriented Organic Rice Farmers in Pakistan
T2  - LAND
AB  - Although organic rice is a niche market in Pakistan, it has exhibited enormous potential for growth in export-oriented production. Since contract farming is the leading promoter of export-oriented organic rice production in Punjab, Pakistan, improving the technical efficiency of smallholder rice farmers through contract farming holds sufficient potential. This work examines the influence of contract farming participation on smallholder rice farmers' technical efficiency using a cross-sectional data set of 650 respondents. We applied a stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to examine the production frontier and inefficiency estimates. Further, propensity score matching (PSM) was used to control endogeneity and self-selection bias in technical efficiency estimates. The results reveal that the technical efficiency score of organic rice farmers in Punjab, Pakistan, is 89.7%, which can still be improved by 10.3% at the current sociodemographic characters and input levels. Likewise, land size, seed, and machine expenditures are the key inputs of the production frontier. Results show a positive and significant connection between contract farming participation and technical efficiency. The study extends the literature on technical efficiency, export-oriented production, contract farming, and the well-being of smallholder farmers. Moreover, the study's findings provide cues for policies and practices.

TI  - Challenges and opportunities for agro-pastoral livestock smallholders in Mali
T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - This paper reports on an in-depth assessment of smallholder livestock production in rainfed agro-pastoral communities of Mali through an analysis of data from 36 case studies. Approximately 1,108 farmers were involved, with two-thirds of the case studies focusing on ruminant production and the remainder dealing with cooperative capacity building. Feeding and forage-related needs were the most frequently assessed in the case studies involving smallholders raising small ruminants or cattle, whereas organization-related needs were the most frequently assessed in those involving smallholder livestock cooperatives. Meeting the feed and forage requirements of small ruminants and cattle is the most urgent need for livestock smallholders, but addressing this challenge will be difficult without concurrent control of the breeding season and common diseases as well as implementation of appropriate methods to track and cull unproductive animals. Empowerment of grass-roots organizations, particularly women's cooperatives, through literacy programmes and effective extension outreach could have significant impacts on the improvement of smallholder livestock enterprises.

TI  - Changing climate - Changing livelihood: Smallholder's perceptions and adaption strategies
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Experts expect that climate change will soon have a severe impact on the lives of farmers in the region surrounding Kerala, India. This region, which is known for its monsoon climate (which involves a distinct temporal and spatial variation in rainfall), has experienced a decrease in annual rainfall over the last century. This study is aimed at investigating how smallholder farmers perceive climate change and at identifying the methods that these smallholders use to adapt to climate change. We use data collected from a survey of 215 households to compare the climate vulnerability of three watershed communities in Kerala. We find that the farmers perceive substantial increases in both temperature and the unpredictability of monsoons; this is in accordance with actual observed weather trends. The selection of effective adaptation strategies is one of the key challenges that smallholders face as they seek to reduce their vulnerability. The surveyed households simultaneously use various adaptation methods, including information and communication technology, crop and farm diversification, social networking through cooperatives, and soil and water conservation measures. The results of a binary regression model reveal that the household head's age, education and gender, as well as the farm's size and the household's size, assets, livestock ownership, poverty status and use of extension services, are all significantly correlated with the households' choices regarding adaptations to cope with climate change.

TI  - Non-participation of low-income households in community-managed water supply projects in India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW
AB  - Efforts to promote community-managed water supply and extend services to underserved low-income communities in urban areas in the developing world prescribe participation as a key component for success. Scholars and practitioners view participation as an empowering process designed to mobilise communities to become involved in planning, implementing and managing their own water supply systems. However, these well-intentioned efforts have had limited success in motivating households to participate. This paper attributes the decision by low-income households not to participate in community-managed water projects to resource constraints at the household level. We analyse survey data from three cities in central India to assess which households are more likely to participate in community-managed water supply and why. Our findings underscore the importance of contextual influences on participation and suggest that households with relatively fewer economic and social constraints are generally more inclined to participate.

TI  - Socio-economic factors affecting the rate of adoption of acacia plantations by smallholders in Indonesia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Acacia plantations have an important role in increasing the reforestation rate and fulfilling the market demand for processed timber in some Asian countries. This study investigates the factors affecting the time-to-adoption of Acacia spp. by smallholders in different landscapes of Indonesia. We use discrete time duration analysis and data on time of first adoption by 430 landholders from Yogyakarta and the outer regions of South Sumatra and West Kalimantan. Results show that, on average, the time to adoption among smallholders in Yogyakarta was 3.1 years, while that for the outer regions was considerably longer at 10.8 years. Faster rates of acacia adoption were associated with smallholders growing other timber species, having larger land holdings, land acquired from inheritance (compared to via the market), being younger, having an on-farm occupation, and having experience of contracts used in commercial forestry. Changes in the reforestation schemes had limited impact on the adoption rate of acacia, although some schemes marginally decreased or increased the adoption rate. This could be associated with limited availability of acacia seedlings provided by government, which prioritizes seedlings of other commercial tree species, and changes in the contract mechanisms. The mode of extension, such as farmer-to-farmer learning and forest extension agents, also affected adoption.

TI  - Entrepreneurial ecosystem for cooperatives: The case of Kyrgyz agricultural cooperatives
T2  - ANNALS OF PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - The article discusses the development of agricultural cooperatives in Kyrgyzstan from an entrepreneurial ecosystem (EE) perspective. Agricultural development priorities explain cooperatives' importance in Kyrgyz government's policies, but cooperatives still fail at countering the challenges of the smallholder economy. Considering agricultural cooperatives as a form of rural entrepreneurship, this paper aims to contribute to the discussion of the factors that support cooperatives in developing countries adapting the EE framework to cooperative entrepreneurship. Using a content analysis method, we analysed and coded textual data from documentary and archival publications on the agricultural cooperatives in Kyrgyzstan published by the government, cooperatives and their unions and the reports of international organizations. We identify five main dimensions of the cooperative entrepreneurial ecosystem for cooperatives: (1) policy and regulatory framework; (2) education and skills; (3) market environment; (4) culture; (5) networks. We found that even if the overall structure of cooperatives' EE can be comparable to conventional enterprises, its sub-elements significantly differ for cooperative enterprises. Despite its exploratory character and single-case research design, this article contributes to the theoretical discussion on cooperative entrepreneurial ecosystems in post-socialist developing contexts and offers a framework of analysis for cooperative development policies and practices.

TI  - Market Channel Choice and Its Impact on Farm Household Income: A Case Study of 243 Apple Farmers in Shaanxi province, China
T2  - JARQ-JAPAN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY
AB  - Although Shaanxi province is the largest in China, both in terms of apple production and cultivated areas, with local farmers' income mainly sourced from apples, the per-capita net income of farmers in Shaanxi province remains behind the national average. Since the market channel choice of farmers could be perceived as one of the available income strategies, this paper provides empirical evidence to measure the impacts of market channel choice on farmers' income using a Heckman sample selection model and an OLS model based on a farm household survey of 243 apple farmers in Baishui and Luochuan counties of Shaanxi province, China. Moreover, this paper discusses the different impacts of market channel choice on household income among farmers who are cooperative members and those who are not.

TI  - Fempreneurs or organic tea farmers? Entrepreneurialism, resilience and alternative agriculture in Darjeeling, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - In this article I underscore how women organic tea farmers build economic resilience through dual enactments as "organic farmers" and as "entrepreneurs." In substantiating both, women question the limited optics through which Fair Trade type sustainability ventures measure their work for a tea cooperative, as well poorly recognizing their entrepreneurial work in their households and community. Women are deeply aware of the politics of Fair Trade where their productive and reproductive labor is appropriated through the labor of organics, where women not only produce the organic green leaf tea but also produce narratives of Fair Trade's success in its certification and gender audits. Thus, to understand what sustains the new wave of "sustainable agriculture" in the global South, we must explore the intersections of organic farming practices with emerging discourses and practices of gendered entrepreneurialism in organic farming communities. In Darjeeling, India, women provide the labor necessary to sustain organics that should ideally come from the Indian state or international trading partners. They fill the gap through their labor, time, creativity and risk-taking. I contend that the success of organic farming depends on critical maneuvers that entail economic and cultural entrepreneurialism, and demonstrate forms of resilience expressed through which women farmers identify and navigate the inadequacies of alternative agriculture and related Fair Trade practices.

TI  - Impact of Meadow Degradation on Soil Water Status and Pasture ManagementA Case Study in Tibet
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
CP  - 2nd Scientific Conference on United-Nations-Convention-Combat-Desertification (UNCCD)
AB  - Alpine meadow dominated by Kobresia pygmaea forms both an important ecosystem and the main pasture resource on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and its degradation is detrimental to ecosystem health and the pastoral economy. This paper reports research on the impacts of possible degradation on soil and biological properties related to water status, as water availability is fundamental to grass productivity. It also considers herders' perceptions towards, and adaptation to, the changing environment. The research was carried out in and around Kema village in Nagqu Prefecture, Northern Tibet. The biotic and abiotic properties of the K. pygmaea meadow are significantly different in patches with diverse soil and vegetation combinations, which include normal meadow, crusted meadow, and bare soil. Change of species composition, low species diversity, coarsening of soil, and lack of soil moisture and organic matter are found under bare soil after erosion of the turf layer. Low infiltration rates and reduced dew deposition are found under crusted meadow. Herders have witnessed some aspects of the deterioration of meadow quality and have noticed some climatic variations. However, they do not consistently link changing meadow quality to climate change and rarely have a clear idea of what overgrazing is, as although their mobility has been reduced, they may think that they are still using pastures periodically as in transhumance. Adapting current privatisation policies by considering herders' traditions and needs, and balancing scientific knowledge with local perception and knowledge, will help to guarantee long-term benefits through sustainable use of the fragile alpine meadow resource.

TI  - Social capital and utilization of immunization service: A multilevel analysis in rural Uttar Pradesh, India
T2  - SSM-POPULATION HEALTH
AB  - The National Health Policy (2017) of India advocates Universal Health Coverage through inclusive growth, decentralization, and rebuilding a cohesive community through a participatory process. To achieve this goal, understanding social organization, and community relationships - defined as social capital - is critical. This study aimed to explore the influence of individual and community-level social capital on a critical health system performance indicator, three-doses of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT3) immunization among 12-59 month children, in rural Uttar Pradesh (UP), India. The analysis is based on a cross-sectional survey from two districts of UP, which included 2239 children 12-59 months of age (level 1) from 1749 households (level 2) nested within 346 communities (level 3). We used multilevel confirmatory factor analysis to generate standardized factor scores of social capital constructs (Organizational Participation, Social Support, Trust and Social Cohesion) of the household heads and mothers both at individual and community level, which were then used in the multilevel logistic regressions to explore the independent and contextual effect of social capital on a child's DPT3 immunization status. The result showed only community-level Social Cohesion of the mothers was associated with a child's DPT3 immunization status (Adjusted odds ratio = 1.25, 95% confidence interval = 1.12-1.54; p = 0.04). Beyond its independent effect on utilization of immunization service, the collective Social Cohesion of the mothers significantly modified the relationship of child age, mother's knowledge of immunization, community wealth, and communities' contact with frontline workers with immunization status of the child. With a strong theoretical underpinning, the result substantially contributes to understanding the individual and contextual predictors of immunization service utilization and further advancing the literature of social capital in India. This study can serve as a starting point to catalyze social capital within the health interventions for achieving wellbeing and the collective development of society.

TI  - Innovation in the use of wood energy in the Ukrainian Carpathians: Opportunities and threats for rural communities
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Ukraine is traditionally deeply dependent on fossil and nuclear energy. However, in response to global climate and energy policies, a major shift towards renewable energy (RE) is presently underway. Apart from ample wind and solar capacities, the country has abundant bioenergy resources, mainly from agriculture and forestry. Particularly in the densely-forested Ukrainian Carpathians, wood is the most prominent bioenergy source used to meet the heat demands of households and public buildings. However, despite increasing forest area and timber volume in this region during the last 50 years, affordable bioenergy from forests remains scarce in many areas. At the same time, local communities suffer from energy scarcity, energy insecurity and high energy costs.
   In an effort to understand how better use might be made of Ukraine's bioenergy resource, addressing sustainability goals as well as the needs of local communities, this study assesses the significance and future potential of wood energy for regional economies and households from an environmental, economic and social perspective. The study employs a mixed-method approach combining literature review, a Best Practice contest and semi-structured interviews with forestry sector stakeholders in rural areas of Transcarpathia and Lviv. Several reasons were identified for the scarcity of affordable bioenergy, including the export-oriented wood processing industry, the lack of forest road networks and machinery, the short-term character of national forest strategies in relation to bioenergy, and other institutional settings that limit access to forest resources. Illegal logging, corruption, and lacks of transparency in timber markets add further difficulties. To address these problems and to meet the challenges defined by international climate agreements, two key innovative instruments were identified; 1) certification schemes for forest products and; 2) community-driven bioenergy initiatives (e.g. local cooperatives.). These approaches, ideally embedded in a local energy strategy developed by the communities themselves, have the potential to transform energy and benefit communities and the local economy.

TI  - Does direct settlement of intra-province medical reimbursements improve financial protection among middle-aged and elderly population in China? Evidence based on CHARLS data
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - In low-and middle-income countries, social health insurance schemes are the main focus of efforts to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by promoting access to health care and financial protection. Problems with financial protection in China are caused mainly by health insurance fragmentation and a rapid rise in medical expenditure. In this context, China implemented a policy of direct settlement of intra-provincial medical reim-bursement in 2014. We evaluated the impact of the policy on financial protection with a population aged 45 and above based on the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study from 2011 to 2018. We estimated the policy effects using the difference-in-differences method, based on coarsened exact matching. We found that the policy significantly reduced the catastrophic health expenditures (CHEs) rate by approximately 10% in the population, whether middle-aged or elderly. Subgroup analyses indicated that middle-aged and elderly people living in western China and with lower household incomes received greater protection from the policy. The CHEs rate for the two age groups in western China was reduced by 16.26% and 20.12%, respectively. The CHEs rate was reduced by 24.51% and 17.32% for middle-aged individuals in the lowest and second household income quartiles, respectively, and by 21.31% for older adults in the second household income quartile. The new rural cooperative medical scheme exerted a smaller protective effect than urban medical insurance among the par-ticipants aged 60 and older. We found that in addition to optimizing health insurance schemes, more health care reform measures, such as adopting more efficient payment methods and rationalizing medical expenditures, should be combined to help reduce health inequities and accelerate progress toward achieving UHC and the Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Examining the farmer-buyer relationships in vegetable marketing channels in Eswatini
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - Vegetable farming is the main source of livelihood for smallholder farmers in Eswatini. However, the production and marketing challenges they faced inhibits the farmers from benefiting fully, which calls for relational transactions to enhance exchange efficiency. Therefore, this study aims to determine the nature of relationship constructs between vegetable farmers selling to formal and informal channels. Data elicited from 170 farmers were analysed using factor analysis, multiple regression analysis and discriminant analysis. Results revealed that farmers derived satisfaction from the price offered and communication, while trust was derived from satisfaction, communication and duration of the relationship, and commitment was derived from trust in both channels. The discriminant analysis results revealed that there is statistical significant difference between the channels. Farmers supplying formal markets perceived levels of satisfaction, trust, and commitment better than those supplying informal markets. The results also indicated that satisfaction and trust were the best predictors of the nature of the relationships. The lack of written contracts and low produce quantity purchased by the formal markets contributes to the low-level establishment of the farmer-buyer relationships. Therefore, coordinated supply chains and supplier-development approaches are necessary to complement the logistical requirements associated with fresh produce and to create mutual benefits.

TI  - Assessing farmers' risk preferences and their determinants in a marginal upland area of Vietnam: a comparison of multiple elicitation techniques
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We examine the consistency of risk preference measures based on eight hypothetical elicitation methods and a lottery game applied to smallholder farmers in a marginal upland environment in Vietnam. Using these measures, we identify influencing factors of risk aversion via regression analysis, whereby unlike previous studies, we include several proxies of social capital such as social networks and norms. Data were collected from household heads and spouses separately in a random sample of 300 households. Although correlations between most of the various risk preference measures are all statistically highly significant, most are weak. On average, respondents have a high degree of risk aversion and specific characteristicsgender, age, idiosyncratic shocks, education, social norms, network-reliance with extended family, and connections to local authoritiesare significant determinants of risk preferences across most elicitation methods, whereas othersthe household's dependency ratio, wealth, and covariate shocksare significant in a few methods only. The explanatory power of the models is limited, indicating that other factors are likely to be of greater importance in determining risk preferences. The results can help target safety nets, encourage investments, and lead to the development of more applicable methods for assessing risk preferences of smallholders in developing countries.

TI  - Aid, collective action and benefits to smallholders: Evaluating the World Food Program's purchase for progress pilot
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Agricultural commodity markets in developing countries often operate in a constrained environment of prohibitive transaction costs. Consequently, smallholder farmers are only partly integrated into these markets, a situation that keeps them in a lower level of development equilibrium (poverty trap). Although cooperative institutional alternatives such as Farmers' Organizations (FOs) may reduce transaction costs and revitalize agricultural production and commercialization, they rarely have been successful in fully delivering on these promises. Against this backdrop, the World Food Programmed (WFP) has recently implemented a multi-year and multi-country pilot to increase smallholder participation in commodity markets. The projects involved investing in physical and human capacities of Farmer Organizations (FOs) to aggregate commodities and add value, as well as locally purchasing food aid from the same. The combination of interventions was expected to increase the relative price of agricultural products, particularly staple crops. In this study, using Ethiopian panel survey data, we estimated the causal income and investment effects of the Ethiopian P4P intervention among smallholders. Using an entropy balancing (EB) model and semi-parametric difference-in-difference (DID) model, we show that the P4P intervention has increased per capita consumption by smallholders. Our additional analysis confirms that this effect is heterogeneous owing to elite capture within Farmer Organizations. We also find evidence of increased food consumption scores, increased investments in child schooling, and increased asset holding among program-participating smallholders relative to comparison farmers. Policy implications are discussed.

TI  - Institutions, sustainable land use and consumer welfare: the case of forest and grazing lands in northern Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - Land is an essential factor of production. Institutions that govern its efficient use determine the sustainability of this essential resource. In Ethiopia all land is publicly owned. Such an institutional setting is said to have resulted in the major degradation of Ethiopia's land resources and dissipation of the resource rent. An alternative to this is assigning a private property institution. In this paper, we examine the consumer welfare effects of a change in the institutional setting on communal forest and grazing lands, using a cross-section data set of 200 households in Northern Ethiopia. Findings suggest that changing the current institutional setting could indeed be welfare reducing.

TI  - Factors Influencing Smallholder Rice Farmers' Vulnerability to Climate Change and Variability in the Mekong Delta Region of Vietnam
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - This study analyzed the effects of climate change on rice farmers' livelihoods vulnerability by using primary data elicited from 405 rice farming households in Can Tho, Dong Thap, and Tien Giang provinces in the Mekong Delta Region (MDR) of Vietnam. The Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) showed that Can Tho province was the most vulnerable to climate change, followed by Dong Thap and Tien Giang provinces. In particular, the social index sub-indicator showed high vulnerability. The beta regression analysis identified seventeen significant factors influencing the susceptibility of rice farming households in the study area, such as weather information, flood occurrence, drought occurrence, access to extension services, access to credit, and cooperative membership as well as demographic variables and livelihoods related factors. The LVI result suggests the need for the government to consider raising the priority on households in Can Tho province through adaptation support to improve the resilience and adaptive capacity, especially by enhancing the social network in this area to stimulate support from local authorities and farmer groups. The regression results imply that extension services should provide adequate and timely weather information to equip the farmers to be more prepared for climatic shocks. Moreover, credit facilities with low interest rates should be made available, especially to those who are members of agricultural cooperatives.

TI  - Dairy production in an urbanizing environment-Typology and linkages in the megacity of Bengaluru, India
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Urbanization is a main driver of agricultural transition in the Global South but how it shapes trends of intensification or extensification is not yet well understood. The Indian megacity of Bengaluru combines rapid urbanization with a high demand for dairy products, which is partly supplied by urban and peri-urban dairy producers. To study the impacts of urbanization on dairy production and to identify key features of dairy production systems across Bengaluru's rural-urban interface, 337 dairy producers were surveyed on the socio-economic profile of their household, their dairy herd and management, resources availability and, in- and output markets. A two-step cluster analysis identified four spatially explicit dairy production systems based on urbanization level of their neighborhood, reliance on self-cultivated forages, pasture use, cattle in- and outflow and share of specialized dairy genotypes. The most extensive dairy production system, common to the whole rural-urban interface, utilized publicly available feed resources and pasture grounds rather than to cultivate forages. In rural areas, two semi-intensive and one intensive dairy production systems relying on self-cultivation of forage with or without pasture further distinguished themselves by their herd and breeding management. In rural areas, the village's dairy cooperative, which also provided access to inputs such as exotic genotype through artificial insemination, concentrate feeds and health care, was often the only marketing channel available to dairy producers, irrespective of the dairy production system to which they belonged. In urban areas, milk was mostly sold through direct marketing or a middleman. Despite rapidly progressing urbanization and a population of 10 million, Bengaluru's dairy sector still relies on small-scale family dairy farms. Shifts in resources availability, such as land and labor, are potential drivers of market-oriented intensification but also extensification of dairy production in an urbanizing environment.

TI  - What Contributes to the Activeness of Ethnic Minority Patients with Chronic Illnesses Seeking Allied Health Services? A Cross-Sectional Study in Rural Western China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Actively seeking health services lies at the core of effective models of chronic disease self-management and contributes to promoting the utilization of allied health services (AHS). However, the use of AHS by ethnic minority Chinese, especially the elderly living in rural areas, has not received much attention. This study, therefore, aims to explore the association between personal characteristics and the activeness of ethnic minority patients with chronic diseases in rural areas of western China seeking AHS. A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect data on the socio-demographic and economic characteristics, health knowledge level and health communication channels of the sampled patients. A logistic regression model was used to examine the association of these predictors with the activeness of the surveyed patients in seeking AHS. A total of 1078 ethnic minorities over 45 years old who had chronic conditions were randomly selected from three western provinces in China and were interviewed in 2014. It is found that the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) is the most salient predictor affecting the activeness of Chinese ethnic minorities in seeking AHS. The probability is 8.51 times greater for those insured with NCMS to actively seek AHS than those without (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 4.76-15.21; p < 0.001). Moreover, participants between 60 and 70 years old and those who have five to six household members are more likely to seek AHS compared with other social groups (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.64, 95% CI 1.28-2.97, p = 0.007; OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.15-2.36, p = 0.002). However, the activeness of patients seeking AHS is lower for those who have better household economic conditions. Besides socio-demographic predictors, the Chinese ethnic minorities' activeness in seeking AHS is clearly associated with the communication channels used for receiving health information, which include direct communication with doctors (OR = 5.18, 95% CI 3.58-7.50, p < 0.001) and dissemination of elementary public health knowledge posted on bulletin boards (OR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.61-3.27, p < 0.001) and traditional mass media (OR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.22-2.48, p = 0.002). First, the government should further improve the coverage of NCMS to households suffering from chronic diseases and satisfy the requirements of social groups at different income levels and various ages in their health care to improve their activeness in AHS utilization. Second, doctors' advice, bulletin boards and traditional media are common health communication channels for those seeking AHS and thus should be continuously employed in rural western China. Third, specified healthcare services should be designed to meet the needs of different patient segmentations.

TI  - Inequity in healthcare needs, health service use and financial burden of medical expenditures in China: results from a consecutive household monitoring study in Jiangsu Province
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Although public medical insurance covers over 95% of the population in China, disparities in health service use and out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditure across income groups are still widely observed. This study aims to investigate the socio-economic disparities in perceived healthcare needs, informal care, formal care and payment for healthcare and explore their equity implication.
   Methods: We assessed healthcare needs, service use and payment in 400 households in rural and urban areas in Jiangsu, China, and included only the adult sample (N = 925). One baseline survey and 10 follow-up surveys were conducted during the 7-month monitoring period, and the Affordability Ladder Program (ALP) framework was adopted for data analysis. Negative binomial/zero-inflated negative binomial and logit regression models were used to explore factors associated with perceived needs of care and with the use of self-treatment, outpatient and inpatient care respectively. Two-part model and logit regression modeling were conducted to explore factors associated with OOP health expenditure and with the likelihood of incurring catastrophic health expenditure (CHE).
   Results: After adjusting for covariates, rural residence was significantly associated with more perceived healthcare needs, more self-treatment, higher probability of using outpatient and inpatient service, more OOP health expenditure and higher likelihood of incurring catastrophic expenditure (P < 0.05). Compared to the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), enrollment in the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) or in the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) was correlated with lower probability of ever using outpatient services, but with more outpatient visits when people were at risk of using outpatient service (P < 0.05). NRCMS/URBMI enrollment was also associated with higher likelihood of incurring CHE compared to UEBMI enrollment (OR = 2.02, P < 0.05); in stratified analysis of the rural and urban sample this effect was only significant for the rural population.
   Conclusions: The rural population in Jiangsu perceived more healthcare needs, had a higher probability of using both informal and formal healthcare services, and had more OOP health expenditure and a higher likelihood of incurring CHE. The inequity mainly exists in health care financing, and may be partially addressed through improving the benefit packages of NRCMS/URBMI.

TI  - The changing role of bio-physical and socio-economic drivers in determining livestock distributions: A historical perspective from Kazakhstan
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Despite worldwide trends towards intensive livestock production, some extensive systems retain comparative advantages, particularly in arid regions. In such variable environments, the extent to which natural pastures can contribute to animal nutrition depends on how livestock are distributed with respect to forage resources in time and space. Animal movements are governed by the interactions of bio-physical, economic and institutional drivers and constraints, all of which are dynamic in time and space, making disentangling the relative importance of different drivers challenging. We examine a large migratory system in central Kazakhstan, using unique long-term data in the context of major socio-economic change, to explore the changing role of bio-physical variables in shaping livestock movement. We explore the determinants of livestock distributions across broad ecological zones in pre-Soviet, Soviet and current time-periods. Differences between zones were examined using Soviet literature, recent interviews with herders and satellite imagery. At the site level, we combined data on livestock locations and density for 2003 and 2012 with bio-physical data from remote sensing. Taken together, these data suggest that the importance of bio-physical variables in determining inter-zonal movements and their timing have decreased over time, whilst the significance of economic and institutional factors appears to have increased. Although resource density may still be a "pull factor" driving movement in some situations, there is evidence that "push factors" such as snow cover, presence of harmful insects and temperature combine with herd size to influence movements between zones, leading to a reduction in the matching between grazing distribution and forage resources. These changes reflect the move to livestock management by small household units owning highly variable numbers of animals. They are representative of global trends in pastoral systems, in which reduction in mobility is linked to declines in collective management institutions, increasing integration of pastoralists in the wider economy and land tenure change.

TI  - Community-based health insurance in poor rural China: the distribution of net benefits
T2  - HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB  - The collapse of China's Cooperative Medical System (CMS) in 1978 resulted in the lack of an organized financing scheme for health care, adversely affecting rural farmers' access to health care, especially among the poor. The Chinese government recently announced a policy to re-establish some forms of community-based insurance (CBI). Many existing schemes involve low premiums but high co-payments. We hypothesized that such benefit design leads to unequal distribution of the 'net benefits' (NB) - benefits net of payment - because even though low premiums are more affordable to poor farmers, high co-payments may have a significant deterrent effect on the poor in the use of services in CBI. To test this hypothesis empirically, we estimated the probability of farmers joining a re-established CBI using logistic regression, and the utilization of health care services for those who joined the scheme using the two-part model. Based on the estimations, we predicted the distribution of NB among those who joined the CBI and for the entire population in the community. Our data came from a household survey of 4160 members of 1173 households conducted in six villages in Fengshan Township, Guizhou Province, China. Three principal findings emerged from this study. First, income is an important factor influencing farmers' decision to join a CBI despite the premium representing a very small fraction of household income. Secondly, both income and health status influence enrolees' utilization of health services: richer/sicker participants obtain greater NB from the CBI than poorer/healthier members, meaning that the poorer/healthier participants subsidize the rich/sick. Thirdly, wealthy farmers benefit the most from the CBI with low premium and high co-payment features at every level of health status. In conclusion, policy recommendations related to the improvement of the benefit distribution of CBI schemes are made based on the results from this study.

TI  - Political office and household wealth: Rural China in the Deng era
T2  - CHINA QUARTERLY
AB  - Evidence from sample surveys and local field studies have long supported opposed arguments about the impact of market reform on the value of political office in the rural economy. This article reviews the evidence, describes a gradual convergence in findings, and identifies unresolved questions about qualitatively different local paths of development. Examining previously unexploited data from a nationally representative 1996 survey, a resolution of the remaining issues becomes evident. The value of political office initially is very modest, as the first private entrepreneurs reaped large incomes. However, subsequent economic development led to rapid increases in the earning power of cadres and their kin, and by the end of the Deng era the returns to political office were roughly equal to those of private entrepreneurs. The political advantages were not limited to regions that industrialized rapidly under collective ownership: they were large even in regions where the private economy was most extensive. However, despite evidence of large and enduring political advantages, those who reaped wealth from political position were only a small fraction of the newly rich, the vast majority of whom achieved wealth without current or past office-holding or kinship ties to cadres.

TI  - Community-based seasonal movement grazing maintains lower greenhouse gas emission intensity on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Global livestock husbandry provides ecosystem goods and services but also emits 7.1 Gt CO2-eq. of greenhouse gases (GHGs) per year. To lower GHG emissions intensity, appropriate production management systems should be identified. Since the 1980s, grassland livestock husbandry in China has transformed gradually from pastoralism into individual household management under the Grassland Household Contract System Policy. However, little is known about how this transition influences GHG emissions. We selected two case study sites representing two different forms of rangeland management systems in Ruoergai county of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, viz. 1) household-based all year continuous grazing under the individual use of rangeland with fences demarcating boundaries; 2) community-based seasonal grazing under the common use of the whole rangeland. The objective was to examine the differences in greenhouse gas emission intensity between the two systems using life cycle assessment (LCA). The results showed that the transition from community-based seasonal grazing into household-based continuous grazing increased the GHG emissions intensity from-0.62 kgCO(2)-eq/kg meat to 10.51 kgCO(2)-eq/kg meat. The increase was primarily attributed to changes in soil carbon storage. Findings suggest that to minimize GHG emissions and environmental degradation, community-based seasonal grazing in the pastoral area of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau should be maintained. Enhancing soil carbon sequestration by adopting appropriate practices would further reduce the GHG emissions intensity arising from the livestock system.

TI  - Identifying Social-ecological Linkages to Develop a Community Fire Plan in Mexico
T2  - CONSERVATION & SOCIETY
AB  - Community forestry in rural Mexico presents a unique opportunity to study the linkages and feedback within coupled social-ecological systems due to the fact that agrarian or indigenous communities control approximately half of the national territory of Mexico. We used social and ecological diagnostic tools to develop a fire management strategy for a communal forest containing an endemic pinon pine species, Pinus cembroides subs. orizabensis, in the state of Tlaxcala, Mexico. The ecological diagnostic was done through fuel inventory, forest structure sampling, and fire behaviour modelling. The social assessment was conducted through household interviews, community workshops, and direct participant observation. The ecological fire hazard was quantified and coupled with the social assessment to develop a fire management plan. Vertical fuel continuity and flashy surface fuels created a high fire hazard. Modelled fire behaviour showed a rapid rate of spread and high flame lengths under multiple scenarios. Relative impunity for starting forest fires, poor community and inter-agency organisation, and lack of project continuity across organisational sectors appear to be the most significant social limiting factors for wildfire management. Combining both social and ecological diagnostic tools provides a comprehensive understanding of the actual risks to forests, and identifies realistic community-supported options for conservation on cooperatively managed lands.

TI  - Analyzing Variations in Size and Intensities in Land Use Dynamics for Sustainable Land Use Management: A Case of the Coastal Landscapes of South-Western Ghana
T2  - LAND
AB  - Land use/land cover change (LULCC) studies are gaining prominence among environmentalist and land use planners. This is due to the effects of LULCCs on natural ecosystems and livelihoods. In the coastal landscape of south-western Ghana, there exist knowledge gaps in the variations in size and intensities in LULCCs and the degree of change among land cover types in LULCC studies. Such studies are important for identifying periods of rapid land cover transitions and their implications on the landscape. Using change detection, intensity analysis and informal stakeholder conversations, the land use system dynamics of the study landscape was analyzed over a 34-year period to assess the variations in size and intensities in LULC transitions and its implications. The results showed a dynamic landscape driven primarily by rubber and settlement expansions. Rubber and settlement increased threefold (172.65%) and fourfold (449.93%) in the 34-year period mainly due to rubber outgrower scheme and onshore infrastructural developments, respectively. Gains in rubber and settlement targeted arable lands. The LULCC implies local food insecurity issues, declines in ecosystem services and compromised livelihoods, hence, the enforcement of the Land Use and Spatial Planning Act (2016) is recommended in land use planning in the coastal landscapes of south-western Ghana.

TI  - MILK Symposium review: Improving control of mastitis in dairy animals in Nepal
T2  - JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
CP  - MILK Symposium on Improving Milk Production, Quality, and Safety in Developing Countries at the ADSA Annual Meeting
AB  - Dairy animals are an important source of income, food, and nutritional security, and improvements in the productivity of dairy animals substantially improve the wellbeing of smallholder dairy farmers. As in other developing countries, dairy animals are key for rural livelihoods in Nepal but often suffer from mastitis-a production disease causing economic losses to farmers, challenges to the dairy processing industry, and possible health hazards to consumers. Studies show that the prevalence of subclinical mastitis in Africa and Asia typically exceeds 50%, threatening animal wellbeing, farmers, dairy processors, and consumers. We conducted a study in Nepal to develop a technology training package to control mastitis in dairy animals. Following identification of knowledge gaps, a technology package consisting of (1) developing good husbandry practices, implementing mastitis detection and control technologies; and (2) training technicians and farmers was implemented. A strategy was subsequently established to provide feedback to farmers in dairy cooperatives on the subclinical mastitis status of their cows. The pack-age was applied in the mid-western region of Nepal. Six months after implementation, we observed a reduction in subclinical mastitis prevalence: from 55% (baseline) to 28% (endline; n = 432) in dairy cows and from 78% to 18% (n = 216) in buffalo. These positive study out-comes strongly suggest that the mastitis technology training package should be scaled across smallholder farmers within and beyond Nepal to control mastitis in dairy animals.

TI  - Risk factors associated with cassava brown streak disease dissemination through seed pathways in Eastern DR Congo
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Vegetatively propagated crops are particularly prone to disease dissemination through their seed systems. Strict phytosanitary measures are important to limit the impact of diseases as illustrated by the potato seed system in Europe. Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) is a devastating disease caused by two viral species collectively named cassava brown streak viruses (CBSVs). CBSD can cause substantial root yield losses of up to 100% in the worst affected areas and is easily transmitted through stem cuttings. In Eastern and Central Africa, the epidemiology of CBSVs in the local socio-economical context of production remains poorly known while a better understanding would be an asset to properly manage the disease. This lack of information explains partially the limited efficiency of current regulatory schemes in increasing the availability of quality seed to smallholders and mitigating the spread of pests and diseases. This study surveyed the epidemiology of CBSVs in Uvira territory, Eastern D.R. Congo, and its drivers using a multivariate approach combining farmer's interview, field observation, sampling and molecular detection of CBSVs. Investigation on the epidemiology of CBSD revealed that three clusters in the study area could be identified using five most significant factors: (i) symptoms incidence, (ii) number of whiteflies, (iii) types of foliar symptoms, (iv) cutting's pathways and (v) plant age. Among the three clusters identified, one proved to be potentially interesting for seed multiplication activities since the disease pressure was the lowest. Through risk assessment, we also identified several key socio-economic determinants on disease epidemy: (i) factors related to farmer's knowledge and awareness (knowledge of cassava pests and diseases, knowledge of management practices, support from extension services and management strategies applied), (ii) factors related to the geographical location of farmer's fields (proximity to borders, proximity to town, distance to acquire cuttings), as well as (iii) the pathways used to acquire cuttings.

TI  - Water Meters and Monthly Bills Meet Rural Brazilian Communities: Sociological Perspectives on Technical Objects for Water Management
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Lasting solutions for communities in need of improved water and sanitation services notably rural ones depend on a balanced consideration of what some have called natural, technical, and social factors. Worldwide deficits in access to appropriate water services in rural areas highlight the need to develop sustainable management models, which are increasingly being proposed with an emphasis on local user participation. The current research analyzes a case study of two rural communities in Northeast Brazil who recently began receiving water supply services through the SISAR, a state-affiliated organization underpinned by shared management with local actors. Using sociological frameworks based conceptually in Actor-Network Theory, the study's main objectives aimed to characterize what changes if any the application of the SISAR's model would produce upon local dynamics, be them wide-scale or intra-household. Field research was carried out over three months in 2014, in which the researcher interviewed a handful of professionals and several dozens of local residents during an extended in situ research phase. Our study finds that two technical factors (the water meter and monthly bill) were at the heart of key tensions and uncertainty for users in the new water management model. Lacking appropriate guidance, users acquainted themselves with these technical objects with what personal resources, interests, and intuitions they possessed. Users were without instruction on how the meter worked, how to understand the bill, and did not know that a price table even existed. Consequently, users revealed unknown qualities of these objects that countered the service provider's intentions to rationalize water use, and adopted attitudes and behaviors marked by subjective impressions of precaution and frugality. The findings show that technical objects have no self-evident qualities to users and, thus, users must learn or be taught how to interact with them in such a way as to produce desired outcomes. Rushed attempts at establishing low-cost, so-called participative models may indeed have heavy consequences. The most significant of which is an unfavorable climate for the formation of societies where informed individuals collectively possess the tools required to grasp the situations they live within and manage sustainable water supply systems. Awareness of one's environmental impact is predicated on knowledge of one's consumption. Thus, this research contributes to development-related discussions by demonstrating that producing particular user attitudes and behaviors on a mass scale vis-a-vis resource consumption requires regular efforts to understand and mediate the encounter between users and non-human actants.

TI  - Health insurance and consumption: Evidence from China's New Cooperative Medical Scheme
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - We exploit a quasi-natural experiment arising from the introduction of a health insurance program in rural China to examine how the insurance coverage affects household consumption. Results show that, on average, the health insurance coverage increases nonmedical-related consumption by more than 5%. This insurance effect is observed even in households with no out-of-pocket medical spending. In addition, the insurance effect is stronger in households with worse self-reported health status. These results are consistent with the precautionary savings argument. The insurance effect also varies by household experience with the program. In particular, the effect is significant only in villages where some households have actually obtained reimbursement from the insurance program. The program within these villages stimulates less consumption among new participants than among households that have participated in the program for more than a year.

TI  - Have lower-income groups benefited more from increased government health insurance subsidies? Benefit incidence analysis in Ningxia, China
T2  - HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB  - China's government subsidies on the demand side-such as subsidizing medical insurance premiums-have accelerated progress towards universal health coverage. We examined whether the increased government subsidies had benefited the population, especially the poor. We conducted two rounds of household surveys and collected the annual claims reports of a rural medical insurance scheme in Ningxia (a relatively underdeveloped region in Western China). We used benefit incidence analysis to evaluate the distribution of benefits for different health services received by individuals with different living standards, as measured by the household wealth index. From 2009 to 2015, the benefit received per capita tripled from 101 to 332 CNY, most (>94%) of which was received for inpatient care. The overall distribution of benefits improved and became pro-poor in 2015 [the concentration index (CI) changed from -0.017 to -0.092], mainly driven by inpatient care. The poorer groups benefited disproportionately more from inpatient care from 2009 to 2015 (the CI changed from -0.013 to -0.093). County and higher-level inpatient care had the greatest improvements towards a pro-poor distribution. The distribution of subsidies for outpatient services significantly favoured the poorer groups in 2009, but less so in 2015 (CI changed from -0.093 to -0.068), and it became less pro-poor in village clinics (CI changed from -0.209 to -0.020). The increased government subsidies for the rural medical insurance scheme mainly contributed to inpatient care and allowed the poor to use more services at county and higher-level hospitals. China's government subsidies on the demand side have contributed to equity in benefit incidence, yet there is a noticeable increasing trend in utilizing services at higher levels of providers. Our findings also indicate that outpatient services need more coverage from rural medical insurance schemes to improve equity.

TI  - Why do small-scale producers choose to produce under contract? Lessons from nontraditional vegetable exports from Zimbabwe
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This article explores the motivations behind the decision of small-scale producers to grow nontraditional vegetables under contract for export. Based on a survey of small-scale producers in Zimbabwe, four factors are identified as motivating contracting, namely, market uncertainty, indirect benefits (e.g., knowledge acquisition), income benefits, and intangible benefits. Respondents are clustered according to the relative importance of these factors in their contracting decision. Four clusters are identified and related to the characteristics of these fanners including size of the farm, amount of land devoted to export crops, access to alternative markets, and the proportion of family income derived from export crops. The results suggest that there are systematic differences between farmers in their decisions to contract which needs to be recognized in contract design and management. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Shared latrines in Maputo, Mozambique: exploring emotional well-being and psychosocial stress
T2  - BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS
AB  - Background: Approximately 18% of Sub-Saharan Africa's urban population relies on shared sanitation facilities, which are shared by one or more households. While there is growing recognition of sanitation's relationship with stress and well-being-particularly among women-most research has focused on rural populations and the transition from open defecation and/or unimproved latrines to private shared sanitation. This study explores sanitation-related stressors among users of both improved and unimproved shared sanitation facilities.
   Methods: This study was nested within the larger MapSan health impact trial (Trial Registration: NCT02362932) Participants were recruited from the control arm of the trial (Traditional Latrine (TL) users) and intervention arm, which received one of two improved shared sanitation facilities - Shared Latrines (SL) shared by up to 20 individuals and Community Sanitation Blocks (CSBs) shared by more than 20 individuals Sampling was informed by a life stage perspective to reflect diversity in sanitation needs and experiences within the population. Data included 96 in-depth interviews, 7 focus group discussions, and 25 unstructured observations. Data collection and analysis followed a Grounded Theory approach, which was used to identify the key domains of sanitation-related stress among participants. A semi-structured tool was applied to all female interview transcripts to assess the frequency and severity of key stressors.
   Results: Participants reported stress due to: lack of safety; lack of privacy; disgust about the latrine condition; and collective action failure in terms of managing the latrine, often causing neighborhood conflict or unhygienic sanitation conditions. Fewer SL and CSB users reported specific stress domains and - with the exception of perceived safety - reported fewer severe stressors. The leading cause of stress reduction due to the intervention was decreased disgust followed by increased privacy and safety.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that "improved", shared facilities can reduce stress when proper maintenance and management systems are in place. Private, shared sanitation only had limited impact on users' perceptions of safety, particularly at night, suggesting that safety concerns extend beyond the physical latrine structure. Our research demonstrates that factors including latrine location and neighborhood violence are important determinants of safety perceptions and corresponding psychosocial stress.

TI  - Inefficiency of Male and Female Labor Supply in Agricultural Households: Evidence from Uganda
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This article analyzes the efficiency of the intra-household allocation of female and male labor inputs in agricultural production. In a collective household model, spouses' optimal on-farm labor supply is such that the marginal rate of technical substitution between male and female labor is equated over different crops. Using the Uganda National Household Survey 2005/06, we test whether this condition holds by estimating production functions and controlling for endogeneity using a method proposed by Gandhi, Navarro, and Rivers (2009). We find that women are less productive than men, that there is more female labor input on low productivity parcels, and that men are relatively more productive on female-controlled plots compared with male-controlled plots. Total farm output could be higher and Pareto improvements could be possible if male labor was reallocated to female-controlled plots and/or female labor was reallocated to male-controlled plots.

TI  - Public vs private administration of rural health insurance schemes: a comparative study in Zhejiang of China
T2  - HEALTH ECONOMICS POLICY AND LAW
AB  - Since 2003, China has experimented in some of the country's counties with the private administration of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), a publicly subsidized health insurance scheme for rural populations. Our study compared the effectiveness and efficiency of private vs public administration in four counties in one of China's most affluent provinces in the initial stage of the NCMS's implementation. The study was undertaken in Ningbo city of Zhejiang province. Out of 10 counties in Ningbo, two counties with private administration for the NCMS (Beilun and Ninghai) were compared with two others counties with public administration (Zhenhai and Fenghua), using the following indicators: (1) proportion of enrollees who were compensated for inpatient care; (2) average reimbursement-expense ratio per episode of inpatient care; (3) overall administration cost; (4) enrollee satisfaction. Data from 2004 to 2006 were collected from the local health authorities, hospitals and the contracted insurance companies, supplemented by a randomized household questionnaire survey covering 176 households and 479 household members. In our sample counties, private administration of the NCMS neither reduced transaction costs, nor improved the benefits of enrollees. Enrollees covered by the publicly administered NCMS were more likely to be satisfied with the insurance scheme than those covered by the privately administered NCMS. Experience in the selected counties suggests that private administration of the NCMS did not deliver the hoped-for results. We conclude that caution needs to be exercised in extending private administration of the NCMS.

TI  - Do Farmer Professional Cooperatives Improve Technical Efficiency and Income? Evidence from Small Vegetable Farms in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - China's small-scale agricultural producers face many challenges to increasing productivity and efficiency. In recent years, the Chinese government has provided support for farmer professional cooperatives (FPCs) to connect small farms with upstream and downstream processes in the food supply chain. This study combines propensity score matching and sample selection-corrected stochastic production frontier analysis to estimate the impacts of FPC participation by greenhouse vegetable producers on technical efficiency and income. Results indicate that FPCs help participants improve returns to scale and marginal returns to land and labor, increase technical efficiency, and obtain (sic)4,460 (18%) greater income per greenhouse than nonparticipants.

TI  - Seed Systems and Farmers' Seed Choices: The Case of Maizein the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
AB  - This paper analyzes how local seed system institutions support seed diversity, itself a requirement for agrobiodiversity maintained on-farm. The paper focuses on maize seed diversity in the central Peruvian Amazon. Using household and community level data from three different cultural groups from the central Peruvian Amazon, empirical results show the importance of collective action and the mediating role of ethnicity in the functioning of informal seed systems that in turn affect farmers' choices regarding conservation of seed diversity. This implies that policies are needed to protect the relatively open seed exchanges of such local practices as a way to sustain on-farm agrobiodiversity.

TI  - Assessing multi-level drivers of adaptation to climate variability and water insecurity in smallholder irrigation systems
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
CP  - 4th International Conference of the Initiative-on-Climate-Adaptation-Research-and-Understanding-through-the-Social-Sciences (ICARUS)
AB  - Smallholder agriculturalists employ a range of strategies to adapt to climate variability. These adaptive strategies include decisions to plant different seed varieties, changes to the array of cultivated crops, and shifts in planting dates. Smallholder access to irrigation water is crucial to the adoption of such strategies, and uncertainty of water availability may prove to be a stimulating force in a smallholder's decision to adjust their on-farm practices. Within smallholder irrigation systems, attributes at multiple levels influence water availability and collective action, and in the process play a role in adaptation: community-level governance institutions may influence trust in others and the ability to overcome appropriation and provisioning dilemmas, and, at the household-level, the availability of irrigation water and socioeconomic and demographic factors may influence farmer willingness to take on the risk of altering their on-farm practices. In this study we investigate smallholder adaptation in Kenya from multiple levels. Specifically, we identify the role of household- and community-level characteristics in shaping smallholder experimentation with different seed varieties. Standard ordinary least squares and logistic regressions are constructed to assess the influence of these interactions on smallholder adaptation. We further discuss the ability of smallholders to respond to poor water provisioning. Among the study's findings is evidence that smallholders are more willing to employ adaptive measures if they have a limited capacity to irrigate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Policy support and emerging farmer professional cooperatives in rural China
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Most farms in China are small and vulnerable to the forces of powerful markets. Recognizing the challenges of small farming, China has promoted farmer professional cooperatives (FPCs) during the past two decades. The overall goal of this study is to analyze the emergence and current status of FPCs, the nature of recent policy initiatives and the role of government policies that have played in promoting recent trends. Based on a unique panel data from two rounds of national representative surveys of 380 villages in 2003 and 2009, this paper shows that while there was nearly no FPC in late 1990s, there were FPCs in 21% of China's villages and these FPCs provided services to about 24 million farm households in 2008. The determinants of FPC analysis show that the role of the government is of primary importance. Policy support measures and, most likely, the new legal setting in China after the passage of the 2006 FPC law, account for most of the growth of FPCs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Truncated Property Rights, Land Finance, and Grassroots Governments: A Case Study of Minor Property Rights Housing in Transitional China
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the institutional foundations of the black market of "minor property rights housing" (MPRH), the informal housing supply in transitional China. The emergence of MPRH has stemmed from China's dualistic land system where rural land owns collectively but the conversion of rural land into urban land use is monopolized by the state. The dualistic land system is compounded by a dualistic household registration structure-the Hukou system in which citizens are restricted to either farm or city household, but unable to switch freely. Consequently, the land property rights and central-local fiscal relations exert intrinsic influences on MPRH's suppliers-the grassroots governments. On one hand, the coercive policies to strictly regulate rural land usage expropriate the rights and opportunities of farmers and grassroots organizations to participate in the land market. On the other hand, the current fiscal system has prevented grassroots governments from obtaining land revenue. The state, however, has no control over all attributes of collective-owned land due to transaction costs. Grassroots governments and peasants can manipulate some attributes of land property rights to minimize the loss. Accordingly, the rise of MPRH reflects the rational choice of grassroots governments and farmers to mitigate institutional constraints. However, as an institutional arrangement with multiple functions, MPRH also has important effects on income redistribution. In other words, village cadres take advantage of their power to manipulate collective land for rent-seeking activities. This reflects the inefficiency of MPRH.

TI  - Gender-based differences in access to and use of loans from rural credit programs for flood adaptation in the farming-dependent char communities of Bangladesh
T2  - WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM
AB  - Recent research on gendered access to credit shows that while women borrowers bear the liability of rural credit programs, the proceeds are often directly invested by their male partners. This paper examines loan access and flood adaptation-related investment activities among char female borrowers. Primary data from a survey of fe-male respondents in 129 households and qualitative data from 6 key informant interviews, 3 focus group dis-cussions, and 18 in-depth interviews reveal that women have limited control over loan investment activities. Men's financial control undermines positive social externalities of women's adaptive capacity from loan use, and loans exacerbate households' gender-related tensions. Although loans foster women's capacity for collective action and flood adaptation, the nexus of gender and microcredit access between partners determines women's access to and use of credit. Further research should investigate how institutions can increase equitable access to loans to improve both men and women's adaptive capacity to natural hazards.

TI  - Impact of institutional constraints on participatory irrigation management: The regulating role of moral obligation
T2  - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
AB  - Participatory irrigation management is key to realizing the virtuous circle in which irrigation facilities are used and managed in rural China. Therefore, it is essential to explore the key factors influencing participatory irrigation management. This paper innovatively analyses the impact of external institutional constraints and internal moral obligation of farmers on participatory irrigation management by using a structural equation model (SEM) and drawing on survey data from 1543 householders in the Yellow River basin. The results indicate that: (i) generally, both institutional constraints and moral obligation have significant positive impacts on collective action in participatory irrigation management; (ii) moral obligation plays an active regulating role in the process of institutional constraints affecting collective action; (iii) collective action contributes positively to the performance of participatory irrigation management. This paper shows that institutional constraints and moral obligation need to be taken into account in participatory irrigation management, and these considerations can offer some insights into governments in managing irrigation systems.

TI  - Final energy footprints in Zambia: Investigating links between household consumption, collective provision, and well-being
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Substantial literature exists on household lifestyles and related energy use and emissions in the global north, but little is known for many countries the global south. We estimate household-level energy footprints for Zambia covering direct (traditional and modern energy carriers) and indirect energy use, and adopting energy extended multiregional input-output. We employ final energy consumption, as it is closer to energy services and thus the purpose of energy use than the total primary energy use. The inequality in energy footprints differs from the inequality in incomes: the poorest half of the households have similar energy footprints and only high-income urban households have significant indirect energy footprints, associated with spend on goods and services. We examine the association between energy footprints and basic well-being measured in terms of physical health, education, nutrition and access to clean water using logistic regression, for a sub-sample of households with children under the age of five. We find that access to provisioning systems is more important than income for need satisfaction. Rural households have limited access to modern energy and provisioning systems and as a result fewer of them attain desirable well-being outcomes. We conclude that access to collective provisioning systems such as education, electricity and indoor sanitation is more important for household need satisfaction than individual provisioning in the form of ownership of durables, or even income. Further research is needed to improve the understanding of the association between energy use and needs satisfaction as it is crucial for addressing decarbonisation and human development agendas.

TI  - Are land-poor youth accessing rented land? Evidence from northern Ethiopia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Continued population growth in densely populated parts of Sub-Saharan Africa makes it harder for youth to choose agriculture as main source of income. We investigate whether near landless youth can access rented land as a source of income. We used data collected in 2016 (from 1138 youths in 119 youth business groups) and 2019 (from 2427 youths in 246 business groups), in five districts of Tigray region of Ethiopia. We find that 42% of the youth had access to rented land in 2016 and 47% in 2019. The average area rented land was 0.66 ha in 2016 and 0.74 ha in 2019. Access to rented land, though constrained, accounted close to 70% in 2016 and 61% in 2019 of the average operated land by youth group members. Male youth who own oxen and ploughs are much more likely to rent land whereas female youth group members appeared generally disadvantaged in their access to rented land and other complementary sources of income. Sharecropping dominated as the main from of land rental contract covering 94% of the contracts in 2016 and 90% of the contracts in 2019. Utilizing a trust game to elicit trust and trustworthiness of the youth, we found a positive association between trustworthiness and particularly accessing land from non-relatives. The prohibition of land sales limits the potential of the "agricultural ladder" to facilitate youth climbing out of poverty through purchase of land. Overall, the land rental market has become more important for land access of land-poor youth and is likely to grow in importance to facilitate rural transformation and diversification of rural livelihoods as land scarcity grows and market access improves. Thus, it appears that the land rental market has helped many of these very land-poor youth to establish sustainable land-based livelihoods. While the land rental market does not function perfectly, we recommend not to intervene to change the fundamental characteristics or to impose area restrictions in the market as has been attempted recently in Ethiopia. Such restrictions can easily cause more harm than good.

TI  - Public procurement for school breakfasts in the Bolivian Altiplan: Governance structures enabling smallholder inclusion
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Public food procurement offers the prospect for an alternative development path toward market inclusion, upgraded skills, and raised income for smallholder farmers. In Bolivia, the current public administration favors smallholder participation by regulating a preference of up to 40% for smallholders and local producers as opposed to other types of suppliers. However, smallholders' provision to local public institutions remains limited. To analyze the reasons for this, three municipalities with different approaches to smallholder procurement were investigated in a multiple-case study. Using transaction cost theory, our findings show that high transaction costs and pure market coordination act as strong barriers to smallholders' active participation. We found that hybrid governance structures, based on different types of relationship-oriented coordination and market exchange enable the inclusion of smallholders via: a) direct and active support from decision-makers, b) gate openers at the municipalities, and c) community embeddedness that supports trust-building and reduces uncertainty. Thus, our study contributes to opening up the 'black box' of hybrids in transaction cost theory by illustrating how social capital influences the mechanisms through which resources are distributed a dimension inadequately considered in the traditional transaction cost theory approach.

TI  - Minimizing the Risk of Catastrophic Health Expenditure in China: A Multi-Dimensional Analysis of Vulnerable Groups
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: In moving toward universal health coverage in China, it is crucial to identify which populations should be prioritized for which interventions rather than blindly increasing welfare packages or capital investments. We identify the characteristics of vulnerable groups from multiple perspectives through estimating catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and recommend intervention priorities.
   Methods: Data were from National Health Service Survey conducted in 2003, 2008, and 2013. According to the recommendation of WHO, this study adopted 40% as the CHE threshold. A binary regression was used to identify the determinants of CHE occurrence; a probit model was used to obtain CHE standardized incidence under the characteristics of single and two dimensions in 2013.
   Results: The total incidence of CHE in 2013 was 13.9%, which shows a general trend of growth from 2003 to 2013. Families in western and central regions and rural areas were more at risk. Factors related to social demography show that households with a female or an unmarried head of household or with a low socioeconomic status were more likely to experience CHE. Households with older adults aged 60 and above had 1,524 times higher likelihood of experiencing CHE. Among the health insurance schemes, the participants covered by the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme had the highest risk compared with the participants of all basic health insurance schemes. Households with several members seeking outpatient, inpatient care or with non-communicable diseases were more likely to experience CHE. Households with members not seeing a doctor or hospitalized despite the need for it were more likely to experience CHE. Characteristics such as a household head with characteristics related to low socioeconomic status, having more than two hospitalized family members, ranked high. Meanwhile, the combination of having illiterate household heads and with being covered by other health insurance plans or by none ranked the first place. Cancer notably caused a relatively high medical expenditure among households with CHE.
   Conclusion: In China, considering the vulnerability of the population across different dimensions is conducive to the alleviation of high CHE. Furthermore, people with multiple vulnerabilities should be prioritized for intervention. Identifying and targeting them to offer help and support will be an effective approach.

TI  - Investigating the Effects of Social Trust and Perceived Organizational Support on Irrigation Management Performance in Rural China
T2  - WATER
AB  - Understanding the factors affecting irrigation management performance is crucial for sustainable resource use, especially with the decentralized management mode of irrigation systems being implemented in rural China. This paper contributes to the research field by incorporating different categories of social trust and perceived organization support (POS) into the analysis of irrigation management performance, by linking multiple elements that are based on the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework. We employed principal component analysis (PCA) and ordered probit regression to analyze a database covering 785 households in the upstream of the Yellow River basin. The results suggested that social trust and POS positively affected the irrigation management performance, and social trust strengthened the positive effect of POS on the performance. Furthermore, the results indicated that personal trust and institutional trust, as well as perceived emotional support and physical support, positively affected the performance. In addition, we also found that household characteristics, household cognition, group characteristics, physical conditions, and rules-in-use also had significant impact on the performance. This paper can be used to inform the government that social trust and POS need to be considered in the common-pool resources (CPRs) management.

TI  - Oil Palm Boom, Contract Farming, and Rural Economic Development: Village-Level Evidence from Indonesia
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Contracts between companies and local communities have been used in Indonesia for over 20 years to involve smallholder farmers in the emerging palm oil industry. Impacts of these contracts have not been analyzed systematically. Here, data from a village survey, spanning a time period from 1992 to 2012, are used to evaluate effects on rural economic development. Panel regression models with village fixed effects show that contracts have significantly contributed to wealth accumulation. Contracts signed before 1999 were more beneficial than contracts signed afterward, which is due to more public sector support and infrastructure investments during the earlier period. Contracts have contributed to decreasing inter-village inequality, not only because poorer villages were more likely to adopt a contract, but also because they benefited more from contract adoption than richer ones. The results suggest that well-designed contracts can be important for smallholder farmers to benefit from the oil palm boom. The village-level approach has clear advantages to evaluate direct and indirect economic effects, but it also has drawbacks in terms of analyzing environmental effects and issues of intra-village inequality. More research with various approaches is needed to better understand the multifaceted implications of oil palm contracts for sustainable rural development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - How to make farming and agricultural extension more nutrition-sensitive: evidence from a randomised controlled trial in Kenya
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We analyse how agricultural extension can be made more effective in terms of increasing farmers' adoption of pro-nutrition technologies, such as biofortified crops. In a randomised controlled trial with farmers in Kenya, we implemented several extension treatments and evaluated their effects on the adoption of beans biofortified with iron and zinc. Difference-in-difference estimates show that intensive agricultural training can increase technology adoption considerably. Additional nutrition training helps farmers to better appreciate the technology's nutritional benefits and thus further increases adoption. This study is among the first to analyse how improved extension designs can help to make smallholder farming more nutrition-sensitive.

TI  - A dengue outbreak on a floating village at Cat Ba Island in Vietnam
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: A dengue outbreak in an ecotourism destination spot in Vietnam, from September to November 2013, impacted a floating village of fishermen on the coastal island of Cat Ba. The outbreak raises questions about how tourism may impact disease spread in rural areas.
   Methods: Epidemiological data were obtained from the Hai Phong Preventive Medical Center (PMC), including case histories and residential location from all notified dengue cases from this outbreak. All household addresses were geo-located. Knox test, a spatio-temporal analysis that enables inference dengue clustering constrained by space and time, was performed on the geocoded locations. From the plasma available from two patients, positive for Dengue serotype 3 virus (DENV3), the Envelope (E) gene was sequenced, and their genetic relationships compared to other E sequences in the region.
   Results: Of 192 dengue cases, the odds ratio of contracting dengue infections for people living in the floating villages compared to those living on the island was 4.9 (95 % CI: 3.6-6.7). The space-time analyses on 111 geocoded dengue residences found the risk of dengue infection to be the highest within 4 days and a radius of 20 m of a given case. Of the total of ten detected clusters with an excess risk greater than 2, the cluster with the highest number of cases was in the floating village area (24 patients for a total duration of 31 days). Phylogenetic analysis revealed a high homology of the two DENV3 strains (genotype III) from Cat Ba with DENV3 viruses circulating in Hanoi in the same year (99.1 %).
   Conclusions: Our study showed that dengue transmission is unlikely to be sustained on Cat Ba Island and that the 2013 epidemic likely originated through introduction of viruses from the mainland, potentially Hanoi. These findings suggest that prevention efforts should be focused on mainland rather than on the island.

TI  - Adoption intensity of a standardized technical system: The higher the better?-Evidence from China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Under contract farming, companies usually develop compulsory standardized technical systems for farmers in developing economies. However, in actual production, farmers often have differences in adoption intensity. Using data from 384 households and multinomial endogenous treatment effect regression, this study analyzes factors affecting the adoption intensity of farmers regarding standardized technical systems and estimates the impacts of adoption intensity of the standardized technical systems on household incomes in Chongqing, China. We adapt a multinomial endogenous treatment effect regression framework to correct for selection bias and endogeneity originating from both observed and unobserved heterogeneity. The results show that some factors could significantly affect the adoption intensity, such as farmers, satisfaction with technicians, perception of technology, attitude toward risks of adopting technologies, number of technical trainings, the proportion of leased land, and distances to townships and technology extension stations. Different from current perspectives, the results also indicate that the highest adoption intensity of farmers regarding standardized technical systems does not bring the greatest benefits. Based on the characteristics of a plot, medium adoption intensity has a significant effect on quality improvements and income growth. The conclusion of this study provides an empirical basis for the formulation and evaluation of policies for farmers that apply standardized technology systems in developing countries.

TI  - Smallholder Farmers' Dissatisfaction with Contract Schemes in Spite of Economic Benefits: Issues of Mistrust and Lack of Transparency
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - Contract farming is typically seen as a useful mechanism to help smallholders in overcoming market access constraints. However, in spite of economic benefits, high smallholder dropout rates from contract schemes are commonplace. We use quantitative and qualitative data from Ghana to show that smallholder farmers benefit from a resource-providing contract in terms of higher yields and incomes, but that most of them still regret their decision to participate in the contract scheme and would prefer to exit if they could. The analysis underlines that research focusing on narrowly defined economic indicators alone cannot explain farmers' satisfaction with contracts and their dropout behaviour. The main problem in the contract scheme is insufficient information provided by the company. Farmers do not understand all the contract details, which leads to substantial mistrust. Farmers believe that the company behaves opportunistically, for instance during the output weighing procedure, and these beliefs are significantly correlated with the farmers' wish to exit. We conclude that issues of mistrust and lack of transparency can contribute to breakdowns of smallholder contract schemes and that such issues should receive more attention in future research on contract farming.

TI  - Identifying and investigating pesticide application types to promote a more sustainable pesticide use. The case of smallholders in Boyaca, Colombia
T2  - CROP PROTECTION
AB  - The present paper investigates pesticide application types adopted by smallholder potato producers in the Department of Boyaca, Colombia. In this region, environmental, health and adverse economic effects due to pesticide mis- or over-use respectively have been observed. Firstly, pesticide application types were identified based on input-effectiveness. Secondly, their determinants of adoption were investigated. Finally suggestions were given to develop intervention options for transition towards a more sustainable pesticide use. Three application types were identified for fungicide and insecticide. The types differed in terms of input (intensity of pesticide application), effect (damage control), frequency of application, average quantity applied per application, chemical class, and productivity. Then, the determinants of different pesticide application types were investigated with a multinomial logistic regression approach and applying the integrative agent centred (IAC) framework. The area of the plot, attendance at training sessions and educational and income levels were among the most relevant determinants. The analysis suggested that better pesticide use could be fostered to reduce pesticide-related risks in the region. Intervention options were outlined, which may help in targeting this issue. They aim not only at educating farmers, but to change their social and institutional context, by involving other agents of the agricultural system (i.e. pesticide producers), facilitating new institutional settings (i.e. cooperatives) and targeting social dynamics (i.e. conformity to social norms).

TI  - Groundwater-Extracting Rice Production in the Rejoso Watershed (Indonesia) Reducing Urban Water Availability: Characterisation and Intervention Priorities
T2  - LAND
AB  - Production landscapes depend on, but also affect, ecosystem services. In the Rejoso watershed (East Java, Indonesia), uncontrolled groundwater use for paddies reduces flow of lowland pressure-driven artesian springs that supply drinking water to urban stakeholders. Analysis of the water balance suggested that the decline by about 30% in spring discharge in the past decades is attributed for 47 and 53%, respectively, to upland degradation and lowland groundwater abstraction. Consequently, current spring restoration efforts support upland agroforestry development while aiming to reduce lowland groundwater wasting. To clarify spatial and social targeting of lowland interventions five clusters (replicable patterns) of lowland paddy farming were distinguished from spatial data on, among other factors, reliance on river versus artesian wells delivering groundwater, use of crop rotation, rice yield, fertiliser rates and intensity of rodent control. A survey of farming households (461 respondents), complemented and verified through in-depth interviews and group discussions, identified opportunities for interventions and associated risks. Changes in artesian well design, allowing outflow control, can support water-saving, sustainable paddy cultivation methods. With rodents as a major yield-reducing factor, solutions likely depend on more synchronized planting calendars and thus on collective action for effectiveness at scale. Interventions based on this design are currently tested.

TI  - SMALL-SCALE FARMER PARTICIPATION IN NEW AGRI-FOOD SUPPLY CHAINS: CASE OF THE SUPERMARKET SUPPLY CHAIN FOR FRUIT AND VEGETABLES IN HONDURAS
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This paper explores the role of transaction costs and collective action in shaping small-scale farmer participation in the fresh fruit and vegetable (FFV) Supply chain to supermarkets (SSC) in Honduras. Transaction costs and collective action are found to be significant in determining farmer participation in the SSC. Contrary to the findings of other studies, human capital and farm characteristic variables are not significant, suggesting that small-scale farmers can be included in new supply chains under certain conditions, especially if incentives to farmers, trust-based relationships between buyers and sellers, risk reduction practices and new forms of collective action are put in place.

TI  - Community based natural resource management in Zimbabwe: the experience of CAMPFIRE
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
CP  - International Workshop on Natural Resource Management and Local Development
AB  - Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) is a long-term programmatic approach to rural development that uses wildlife and other natural resources as a mechanism for promoting devolved rural institutions and improved governance and livelihoods. The cornerstone of CAMPFIRE is the right to manage, use, dispose of, and benefit from these resources. Between 1989 and 2006, CAMPFIRE income, mostly from high valued safari hunting, totalled nearly USD$ 30 million, of which 52% was allocated to sub-district wards and villages for community projects and household benefits. Whilst a number of assumptions underlying the success of CAMPFIRE as an innovative model for CBNRM have yet to be met, CAMPFIRE confirms the concept that devolving responsibility and accountability for natural resource management can be highly effective for the collective and participatory management of such resources. Elephant numbers in CAMPFIRE areas have increased and buffalo numbers are either stable or decreased slightly during the life of the programme. However, offtake quotas for these two species have increased with a concomitant decline in trophy quality. Although the amount of wildlife habitat diminished after 1980, following the commencement of CAMPFIRE the rate of habitat loss slowed down and in some specific instances was even reversed. More recently there has been increased pressure on habitats and other natural resources as a consequence of deteriorating socio-economic conditions in the country. Where devolution has been successful, promising results have been achieved and the recent acceptance and implementation of direct payments to communities is probably the most significant development since 2000. That this has happened can be attributed to CAMPFIRE enabling communities to maximize their roles within the existing set of rules, and by so doing, allowing these rules to be challenged. Donor (73%) and government (27%) investments into the programme amounted to $35 million during the period 1989 to 2003. Since 2003 however, donor funding has been reduced <$600,000 over the past 5 years.

TI  - Agroforestry systems and biodiversity conservation in arid zones: the case of the Tehuacan Valley, Central Mexico
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - The role of agroforestry systems in biodiversity conservation was investigated in the_semiarid Tehuacan Valley, Central Mexico. Richness and diversity of native plant species were compared between agroforestry systems (6 sampling sites) and the following forests (6 sampling sites) dominated by :columnar cacti: (i) "chichipera" dominated by Polaskia chichipe; (ii) dominated by Escontria chiotilla; and (iii) "garambullal" dominated by Myrtillocactus schenckir. Our information on genetic variation of dominant arboreal species in the study sites was reviewed and included in the analysis. Factors influencing household's decisions to maintain vegetation cover were compiled through a survey and interviews and analyzed. All the samples of the agroforestry systems studied maintained on average nearly 59% plant species and 94% genetic variation of dominant cacti occurring in the forests, although their ability to preserve endemic rare species is limited. Social factors favoring maintenance of perennial species in agricultural plots include collective rules, households traditions, use of the plants maintained in the systems, and the environmental information gathered from NGOs, the local Biosphere Reserve, and researchers. However, agroforestry systems are losing their capability to maintain vegetation cover, mainly because of (i) decreasing amount of land managed by households, determined by a progressive fragmentation of the land area given to new families, (ii) adoption of technologies to intensify agriculture, and (iii) governmental programs penalizing the presence of vegetation patches within agricultural lands since they are considered "useless" areas. Necessary policies to stop degradation of the agroforestry systems and to improve their conservation capacity are discussed.

TI  - An examination of the effects of recent tenure reforms in China's collective forests on peasants' forest activities and their income
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - The Chinese government has launched a new wave of reform of collective forestland tenure, with a series of matching reform measures since 2003. The overall goals of these reforms were to increase peasants' income while enhancing sustainable forest resource management. Using a unique large-scale household dataset gathered over eight years, we examine the effects of the new collective forest reforms on peasants' income, labour input and investment for forestry purposes and forest resource management. After examining in detail a number of determinants, we find that the effects of these reforms are varied. Rural households have benefited from the reforms with increased income from forestry, at the expense of a greater degree of forest fragmentation. The NRCFT and the MRMs have not encouraged rural households to invest more for forestry purposes, due to a lack of institutionalized financial support to peasants. Well-designed mechanisms to forest investment in sustainable forest management are called for.

TI  - The Effects of Well Management and the Nature of the Aquifer on Groundwater Resources
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We compare groundwater use under collective well management in China, where village leaders allocate water among households, and under private well management where farmers either pump from their own wells or buy water from wells owned by other farmers. Villages are divided into connected or isolated groups depending on whether there are lateral groundwater flows between aquifers underlying a village and neighboring ones. In rural China, households under collective well management use less water. Even under collective management, households located in connected villages use more water, indicating that the connectedness of the aquifers may undermine leaders' incentives to conserve water.

TI  - Do bottom-up and independent agricultural cooperatives really perform better? Insights from a technical efficiency analysis in Ethiopia
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - The cooperative landscape in Ethiopia is very heterogeneous with a mixture of remains of the pre-1991 government-controlled system and new post-1991 bottom-up collective action initiatives. This heterogeneity, coupled with a large growth in the number of cooperatives in the country, offers an interesting perspective to study the determinants of the (in)efficiency of cooperatives. In this paper, we analyse the performance of Ethiopian agricultural cooperatives, focusing on the degree of technical (in)efficiency and its determinants. We use the stochastic frontier approach in which we account for heteroskedasticity and the monotonicity of production functions, presenting a methodological improvement with respect to previous technical efficiency studies. The results show that NGO- and government-initiated cooperatives are less efficient than community-initiated ones, implying that governments and NGOs should not interfere too strongly in cooperative formation. Cooperatives with a high degree of heterogeneity in members' participation are found to be about 98% less efficient, while cooperatives that have paid employees are 33% more efficient. Besides, results show that cooperatives in Ethiopia function more efficiently if they incentivize committee members through monetary compensation.

TI  - Economic and Spatial Integration of Land-Lost Households in Inland China: Evidence from a Survey in Nanchang City
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Many farmers lost their land and resettled in urban areas because of the rapid urban expansion of China. Although many studies have investigated the livelihood conditions of farmers after their resettlement, very little is known about their long-term outcomes. Based on a questionnaire survey, this study investigated the economic and spatial integration of land-lost farmers living in urban areas for more than ten years. Further, this study also examined the association between their economic and spatial integration. Our survey results indicate that the economic and spatial integration of the offspring from land-lost households were low. Although the educational level of the offspring was higher compared to the previous generation, there were still considerable disparities between them and other urbanites. Additionally, although their employment rate was improved, the quality of their occupations was not significantly enhanced, with unskilled or semi-skilled jobs being the most common. Furthermore, nearly half of the offspring reported a relatively low level of spatial integration (still living in the collective resettlement neighborhoods), which is influenced by demographic characteristics, family characteristics, and economic integration. To achieve sustainable urbanization, efforts should be made to improve the employment qualities and the residential mobility of land-lost households.

TI  - Will social capital affect farmers? choices of climate change adaptation strategies? Evidences from rural households in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Adopting necessary climate change adaptation strategies is an important measure to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. In recent years, social capital has provided a new perspective for analyzing the differences of individual behaviors in the process of climate change adaptation. However, the actual role of social capital in adapting to climate change has not been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we took the high-frigid ecological vulnerable areas on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau as an example. Based on household survey data, we explored the impacts of social networks, social trust and social norms on the choice of climate change adaptation strategies for farmers. Results show that more than 80% of farmers adopt the necessary climate change adaptation strategies. Early transferring/adjusting farming season, artificial grass planting and reducing livestock are their major adaptation strategies. There are significant differences in adopting climate change adaptation strategies between farmers with different social networks, social trust and social norms. The improvements of formal social networks, interpersonal trust, institutional trust, and social norms have significant impacts on the choice of climate change adaptation strategies for farmers. However, the enhancement of informal social networks has a negative impact on it. Finally, we provided suggestions to formulate and implement effective climate change adaptation strategies for areas that sensitive to climate changes.

TI  - Research, development and scaling-up the adoption of fodder shrub innovations in East Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Smallholder farmers in developing countries face numerous limitations that hinder them from embracing improved agricultural practices and innovations with great potential for meaningful transformations of livelihoods. Consequently, farmers continue living in vicious cycles of poverty despite decades of government and donor expenditures on poverty alleviation. In the last two decades, research and development organizations collaborated in testing and validating selected fodder shrub species as reliable sources of less expensive and easily available protein feeds. With minimal interventions, the research findings have great potential to improve productivity for many smallholder farmers. Tested species include Calliandra calothyrsus, Leucaena spp., Chamaecytisus palmensis, Sesbania sesban, Morus alba and Gliricidia sepium. Dissemination and adoption surveys estimated that 205,000 smallholder farmers (40-50 per cent being women) had planted fodder shrubs by 2005. Currently, fodder shrubs contribute US$3.8 million annually to farmers' incomes and estimated potential annual income is US$81 million. Factors associated with success in fodder scaling-up include deliberate involvement of fodder technology champions, collective action in community mobilization and project implementation, pluralistic extension approaches, sustainable germplasm supply systems, broader partnerships and civil society campaigns. Constraints and challenges include: ineffective delivery of extension and research services, inhibitive policies, political interferences, frequent droughts and inadequate monitoring and evaluation systems.

TI  - Giving birth at a health-care facility in rural China: is it affordable for the poor?
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB  - Objective To investigate changes in the expenditure of giving birth in health-care facilities in rural China during 1998-2007, to examine the financial burden on households, particularly poor ones, and to identify factors associated with out-of-pocket expenditure.
   Methods Cross-sectional data on births between 1998 and 2007 were obtained from national household surveys conducted in 2003 and 2008. Descriptive statistics and log-linear models were used to identify factors associated with out-of-pocket expenditure on delivery.
   Findings During 1998-2007, the proportion of facility-based deliveries increased from 55% to 90%. In 2007, 60% of births occurred at county-level or higher-level facilities. The Caesarean delivery rate increased from 6% to 26%. Total expenditure on a facility-based delivery increased by 152%, with a marked rise from 2002 onwards with the introduction of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme. In 2007, out-of-pocket expenditure on a facility-based delivery equalled 13% of the mean annual household income for low-income households. This proportion had decreased from 18% in 2002 and differences between income groups had narrowed. Regression models showed that Caesarean delivery and delivery at a higher-level facility were associated with higher expenditure in 2007. The New Cooperative Medical Scheme was associated with lower out-of-pocket expenditure on Caesarean delivery but not on vaginal delivery.
   Conclusion Expenditure on facility-based delivery greatly increased in rural China over 1998-2007 because of greater use of higher-level facilities, more Caesarean deliveries and the introduction of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme. The financial burden on the rural poor remained high.

TI  - Land Transfer and the Pursuit of Agricultural Modernization in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE
AB  - Agriculture, countryside and peasantry have been priority concerns of the Chinese government, with land and agriculture being the most crucial. With a growing population, less arable land and often relatively low-quality land, Chinese peasant agriculture has been undergoing a form of modernization. While peasants enjoy land-contract rights as a result of the Household Responsibility System (HRS), the state has been promoting transfer of land-use rights in order to promote modern agriculture. This paper seeks to understand recent developments in land and agriculture, particularly exploring the transitions of land and agricultural institutions since 1949 and land transfers since the HRS. In so doing, this paper reveals that the state has been strategically responding to various challenges in order that land institutions and policies are always geared to achieving agricultural modernization. During the state's continual drive for modernizations, particularly agricultural modernization, peasants' livelihood is impacted and needs to be protected.

TI  - Investigating the risk factors for contraction and diagnosis of human tuberculosis in Indonesia using data from the fifth wave of RAND's Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS-5)
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOSOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a globally widespread disease, with approximately a quarter of the world's population currently infected (WHO, 2018). Some risk factors, such as HIV status, nutrition and body mass index, have already been thoroughly investigated. However, little attention has been given to behavioural and/or psychological risk factors such as stress and education level. This study investigated the risk factors for TB diagnosis by statistical analyses of publicly available data from the most recent wave of the Indonesian Family Life survey (IFLS-5) conducted in 2015. Out of 34,249 respondents there were 328 who reported having TB. For comparison and completeness, variables were divided into levels: individual-, household-and community-level variables. The most prominent and interesting variables found to influence TB diagnosis status (on each level) were investigated, and a logistic regression was subsequently developed to understand the extent to which each risk factor acts as a predictor for being diagnosed with TB. Age, health benefit or insurance, stress at work and living in a rural area all showed significant association with TB diagnosis status. This study's findings suggest that suitable control measures, such as schemes for improving mental health/stress reduction and improved access to health care in rural areas should be implemented in Indonesia to address each of the key factors identified.

TI  - Technical Efficiency of Ginger Production in Ilam District of Nepal: A Stochastic Production Frontier Approach
T2  - ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - This study measured the level of technical efficiency among smallholder ginger growers and examined the determinants of inefficiency by employing the stochastic frontier production function. The paper used a simple random sampling technique to interview 100 ginger farmers in Ilam, a leading ginger-producing district in Nepal, with the help of a pretested interview schedule. The STATA.13 software was used to obtain both stochastic frontier estimates and the determinants of technical inefficiency. The results revealed that the average farm-level technical efficiency is 67.8% which shows the scope of increasing the technical efficiency by 32.2%. The coefficients of seed and farmyard manure were positive and showed significant relation to ginger output at a 1% and 5% level of significance, respectively. Education level, training, and membership in cooperatives had a negative and significant impact on technical inefficiency, whereas areas under ginger production had a positive impact on technical inefficiency. Hence, improving the technical knowledge of farmers through training on optimum input use complemented with motivation to join agriculture cooperatives and farmer's associations may increase the technical efficiency of ginger growers in the study area.

TI  - A NORMATIVE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF COOPERATIVE BIODIESEL PRODUCTION USING SOYBEANS PRODUCED BY SMALLHOLDERS IN KWAZULU-NATAL, SOUTH AFRICA
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - The South African biofuels industrial strategy promotes a development-oriented strategy with feedstock produced by smallholders and processed by traditional producer-owned cooperatives. This study examines a proposal to apply this strategy to small-scale farmers in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), using soybeans as feedstock for biodiesel production. First, it is argued that value-adding cooperatives established under South Africa's current Cooperatives Act, No. 14 of 2005 (hereafter the Cooperatives Act) would fail to attract the capital and expertise needed to process biodiesel owing to ill-defined voting and benefit rights. Second, a mixed integer linear programming model is used to determine the viability of producing biodiesel from soybeans, viewed from the perspective of the smallholder as grower and co-owner of the processing plant. It is concluded that smallholder participation would require a rental market for cropland, co-ownership of the processing plant in a non-traditional cooperative or investor-owned firm, information and training, and a high level of government subsidy.

TI  - Determinants of Smallholders' Market Preferences: The Case of Sustainable Certified Coffee Farmers in Vietnam
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study attempts to analyze the market preference of coffee farmers in Vietnam. Using the transaction cost approach, a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model was developed based on the sales volume in different markets, transaction cost attributes, socioeconomic factors, and behavioral aspects of sustainable certified coffee farmers. Factors that significantly influence farmers' market preference include several transaction cost attributes (price uncertainty, market competition, transportation cost, speed of payment, and sale volume agreement) and characteristics of coffee farmers (age, ethnic, farming experience, location, and certificate ownership). Repeated economic transaction embedded in the social relationship indicates the largest sales volume of coffee farmers to the market of buying agents and the existence of local traders. There is a belief that formal institution brings better market access for coffee farmers, but main issues are regarding opportunistic behavior, imperfect market knowledge, traditional farming habits, and contract noncompliance, which have resulted in a lower preference for the market of processors/exporters.

TI  - Smallholder group certification in Uganda - Analysis of internal control systems in two organic export companies
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE TROPICS AND SUBTROPICS
AB  - The organic agricultural sector of Uganda is among the most developed in Africa in terms of its professional institutional network and high growth rates of number of certified farmers and land area. Smallholder farmers are certified organic through contract production for export companies using a group certification scheme (internal control system - ICS). The ICS is a viable and well-accepted tool to certify small-scale producers in developing countries all over the world. Difficulties in certification are still stated to be among the main constraints for Uganda's organic sector development. Therefore, this paper reports a qualitative case study comprising 34 expert interviews in two organic fresh-produce export companies in central Uganda, aiming to explore the challenges which underlie organic certification with ICS. The study shows that farmers cannot be labelled as 'organic by default' but deliberately engage in organic production as a marketing strategy. The small quantities purchased by the organic companies lead to a difficult marketing situation for the farmers, causing production and infiltration risks on the farm level. These risks require increased control that challenges the companies organizationally. The risks and control needs are a reason to involve farmers in ICS procedures and innovatively adapt the ICS by means of a bypass around formal perspective restrictions. The paper discusses different perspectives on risks, risk control and certification.

TI  - Farm households' preferences for collective and individual actions to improve water-related ecosystem services: The Lake Naivasha basin, Kenya
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB  - Interventions in payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs can involve both collective and individual actions. This study explores the potential for the development of payment for water related ecosystem services (PWES) program in the Lake Naivasha basin, Kenya. Using a choice experiment approach, the willingness to accept compensation is estimated for three water-related ecosystem services (WES) attributes: one collective attribute (reforestation) and two individual attributes (environment-friendly agricultural practices and restoration of riparian land). Moreover, the preferences of upstream farm households are analysed with regard to sub-basins where a PWES program has already been implemented and sub-basins where it has not been implemented so far. For sub-basins where PWES has already been implemented, environment-friendly agricultural practices is the only significant attribute for local farmers' choice to improve WES. Reforestation and environment friendly agricultural practices are significant attributes for sub-basins where PWES has not been implemented so far. Farm households are willing to accept compensation but there appears to be heterogeneity in preferences for WES attributes. We find differences in farm households' preferences and values for collective and individual actions. Therefore, contrary to the current norm in PES interventions with a uniform compensation scheme, we recommend conservation payments to vary among ecosystem service providers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impacts of agricultural incentive policies on land rental prices: New evidence from China
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Agricultural incentive policies affects not only agricultural production, but also land rental price. This paper extends the theoretical framework of the effect of agricultural incentive policies on land rental prices by simultaneously considering agricultural tax, agricultural subsidy and output price support policies and methods to implement these policies. The empirical analyses are based on a unique dataset from several rounds of representative rural household surveys that recorded the land rental prices of 7122 plots in 276 villages across 11 provinces during 1999-2018 in China. The survey results show that land rental price had increased significantly until the middle 2010s and then started to fall thereafter. Eliminating agricultural tax based on cultivated land and implementing price support policy through government procurement program have significantly raised land rental price, but the effect of agricultural subsidy to contract holder/owner on land rental price is insignificant. While the econometric results are consistent with the theoretical expectations, this study provides strong empirical evidence that the recipient of subsidy (owner or operator/tenant) matters, and finds the impacts of agricultural subsidy and output price support policies on land rental price in China differ significantly from the previous findings in developed countries due to different ways to implement subsidy and price support policies. The paper concludes with policy implications.

TI  - Multi-household grassland management pattern promotes ecological efficiency of livestock production
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Grassland degradation has become a global environmental concern. Livestock grazing under inappropriate grassland management and climate change contribute to this. Mitigating grassland degradation through revising the management pattern is needed to improve livestock production sustainability. The current study explores if a multi-household management pattern (M-pattern) is a better approach than single-household pattern (S-pattern) from the perspective of ecological efficiency (EE). EE reflects the ability of a household to gain economic output with less inputs and undesirable environmental conditions. We divided the sample households into multi-group (M group), single-renting group (S-R group) and single-no-renting group (S-NR group). The M group households graze livestock on their merged contracted grasslands; the S-R group households graze on contracted grasslands individually; and the S-NR group households graze on contracted and rented grasslands individually. A slack-based model was used to estimate the EE of 413 herders surveyed from three grassland types of two major areas in Inner Mongolia. The EE of the M group was 0.38, significantly higher than that of the S-R group (0.31) and the S-NR group (0.24). The higher EE of the M group was due to better environmental, economic, and input performances when compared with the S-R group and due to better environmental performance and input performances when compared with the S-NR group. The findings indicate that the M-pattem is a better fit for grassland management from the perspective of EE. This suggests that under the private grassland tenure arrangement, the M-pattern should be promoted to reduce grassland degradation and improve economic sustainability.

TI  - Life cycle, labour remuneration, and gender inequality in a Chinese agrarian collective
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - Conventional wisdom about gender inequality and labour remuneration on agrarian collectives in rural China has emphasized various discriminatory practices against women. Using a life cycle approach, this article examines instead the way in which men and women possess changing patterns of and opportunities for work at different stages of their lives. Drawing on economic and demographic data from an agrarian collective in East China, gender differentiation is scrutinized in terms of how work assignment, labour remuneration and work attendance rates were transformed over time. A number of other factors - the persistence of pre-revolutionary patriarchal ideology, as well as government policies on population control and work incentives - that influenced the way in which peasant households deployed labour on the agrarian collective during the 1970s also had a gendered impact on work remuneration.

TI  - Factors influencing the choice of marketing channels: evidence from dairy farmers in Thailand
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VALUE CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study assessed the factors influencing marketing channel choice of dairy farmers in Thailand using primary data obtained from 385 randomly selected dairy farmers in central and north-eastern regions of Thailand. Two types of farmers were surveyed: members of dairy cooperatives (DCs) and members of private organisations (POs) representing the two key marketing channels. Descriptive statistics were used to identify the socio-economic characteristics of farmers, and a binary probit regression model was used to examine the factors influencing farmers' decision regarding the choice of marketing channels. The study revealed that dairy farming experience, the number of years of membership in the milk collecting centres (MCCs), distance to the MCCs, milk price, payment period, access to market information, advisory service, credit service and farm input service had positive influence whereas marketing experience had negative influence on the choice of selling to the DCs. The recommendations are presented.

TI  - The deviation between the willingness and behavior of farmers to adopt electricity-saving tricycles and its influencing factors in Dazu District of China
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - This study aims to explore whether there is a deviation between farmers' willingness and behavior to adopt electricity-saving tricycles and to identify factors influencing the deviation. A total of 234 rural households in Dazu District of China were selected by using the stratified random sampling technique and interviewed face-toface. The cross-analysis method was employed to analyze the deviation, and the binary logit model was used to investigate the influencing factors on the deviation. The results demonstrate that there is a deviation between farmers' adoption willingness and behavior. Of the 193 farmers who were willing to adopt electricity-saving tricycles, only 52 had actual adoption behaviors in their families. The inconsistency rate was more than 73%. The regression results indicate that age, whether the respondents are village cadres, and the terrain of the dwelling have positive effects on the deviation. The number of permanent residents, the diversity of income structure, the area of the dwelling, the cognition toward climate change and individual behaviors of energy use, and whether the respondents participate in rural cooperatives or not affect the deviation negatively. Our findings provide policy implications for government measures to guide the transition from the willingness to the actual adoption behavior of farmers.

TI  - How do contract performance rates affect entrepreneurs' risk-averse attitudes? Evidence from China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - IntroductionEntrepreneurs' attitudes toward risk is one of the most critical factors influencing business growth and economic development. Therefore, addressing the influencing factors and formation mechanisms of entrepreneurs' risk attitudes has become a crucial research endeavor. In this paper, we examine how contract performance rates affect entrepreneurs' risk attitudes through the mediating effect of subjective well-being as well as assess the moderating effect of the regional business environment on this relationship. MethodsThe ordered probit regression technique was employed to analyze the data obtained from 3,660 sampled respondents from the 2019 China Household Finance Survey. All analysis was performed using Stata 15.0. ResultsThe empirical results show that contract performance rates have a substantial positive indirect effect on entrepreneurs' degree of risk aversion through improved subjective well-being. The regional business environment plays a negative regulatory role in the relationship between contract performance rates and entrepreneurs' risk aversion. Furthermore, urban-rural heterogeneity appears to consistently determine the extent of the influence of contract performance rates on entrepreneurs' risk attitudes. ConclusionTo reduce entrepreneurs' risk aversion and enhance social and economic activity, the government should improve regional business environments by taking specific measures. Our study contributes to the empirical understanding of entrepreneurs' investment decisions in the context of urban and rural environments.

TI  - A Success Story of Collective Action Changing Public Policy: Farmers' Innovation in the Face of Repressive Forestry Policy in Zambrana Abajo, Dominican Republic
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - Collective action and capacity building locally are key elements in overcoming poverty through agroforestry and community silviculture. Starting from extreme poverty, degraded soils and a reluctance to plant trees, the communities of Zambrana Abajo in the Dominican Republic were able to confront and change repressive forestry policies, obtaining the first legal right amongst smallholders to harvest timber and establish new livelihoods related to forestry and agroforestry. This study was carried out in order to identify the success factors and the lessons learned in this process. Qualitative research methods were used, including participant observation, review of literature, in-depth interviews with key informants, and semi-structured interviews guided by the Community Capitals Framework. It was found that community participation, local knowledge and the authorities' recognition of it had an impact on forestry policy and overcoming poverty through livelihood diversification thanks to harvesting the species Acacia mangium Willd. The level of understanding about the benefits of trees influenced farmers' decisions to participate in agroforestry and community silviculture projects. The possibility of harvesting timber also influenced farmers' decision to participate and in the diffusion of this initiative to other parts of the country. These findings demonstrate that human capital and its recognition are relevant in improving quality of life for families and improving the natural environment.

TI  - TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND OUTPUT MARKET PARTICIPATION NEXUS AMONG YAM PRODUCERS IN SOUTHWEST REGION OF NIGERIA
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The study assessed the nexus between the transportation system and output market participation among yam producers in Southwest region of Nigeria. A multistage sampling procedure was used to select 180 respondents for the study. Multinomial logit (MNL), Market Participation Index (MPI) and Double-hurdle Regression model were employed for the analysis of data. The MPI result showed that about 87% of the respondents participated in yam market in the area. The most commonly subscribed modes of transportation were pick-up van (55%), motor cycle (26%) and head porterage (7%). The results of the MNL showed that farming experience, extension services, distance, household size and market participation were the factors influencing the preference for the mode of fransportation used by the farmers. Again, the results from the double-hurdle regression identified membership of cooperative society, farming experience, access to market information and mode of fransportation as the factors that determine the decision to participate and the rate of participating in yam market. Therefore, the study concludes that there is a synergy between fransportation system and output market participation which has significant impact on the production and availability of food (yam) in the market.

TI  - The construction of an alternative quinoa economy: balancing solidarity, household needs, and profit in San Agustin, Bolivia
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - Quinoa farmers in San Agustin, Bolivia face the dilemma of producing for a growing international market while defending their community interests and resources, meeting their basic household needs, and making a profit. Farmers responded to a changing market in the 1970s by creating committees in defense of quinoa and farmer cooperatives to represent their interests and maximize economic returns. Today farmer cooperatives offer high, stable prices, politically represent farmers, and are major quinoa exporters, but intermediaries continue to play an important role in the local economy. Meanwhile, some farmers rebuff the national cooperatives and intermediaries in favor of a denomination of origin and closer association with local cooperatives. This article, based on 4 months of ethnographic research, explores the reasons for the continued presence of intermediaries on the market landscape and how farmers have worked to create a quinoa economy embedded with fair trade values. Farmers demand stable prices, flexible standards, provision of services, and promises of maintaining the distinctive qualities of San Agustin quinoa. They frame their trades in economic, utility, and solidarity terms to reflect their livelihood strategies, farming capabilities, and personal concepts of fair trade. Meanwhile cooperatives, development initiatives, and intermediaries each argue that their particular buying practices allow farmers to attain household goods, credit, and cash for food and economic security.

TI  - Determinants of groundnut producers' market channel choice in Western Oromia region, Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH
AB  - Lack of adequate number of groundnut farmers' market channels remain long lasting problems in the study area. However, the choice of an appropriate market channel enables farmers to get reasonable profits from groundnut production. This study aimed to identify the existing groundnut market channels and to analyze determinants of channel choice decisions of smallholder groundnut producers in Western Oromia. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 400 sample household heads. Primary data were collected using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire and through key informant interviews using checklists. Multivariate probit (MVP) model was used to analyze determinants of groundnut market channel choices. The model resulted from that level of education, distance from the nearest market, access to market information, cooperative membership, trust in buyers, access to credit, the quantity of groundnut sold, own transport facilities, and access to off/non-farm income affected the probability of households in combination to select collector, wholesaler, retailer, and consumer market channels at different significance levels. The findings of the study suggest that there is a need for all concerned bodies like government to create market linkage between farmers and buyers, provide improved seed and other production inputs while farmers should maximize quantity of groundnut produced through accessing improved seed and other production inputs and market related development bodies should help in organizing farmers' groundnut cooperatives. Similarly, strengthening micro financial institution to provide credit for groundnut producers is the area where interventions required.

TI  - From sharecropping to crop-rent: women farmers changing agricultural production relations in rural South Asia
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - This paper explores changing production relations in agriculture in context of increasingly widespread and longer-duration male outmigration, as against previous, short-duration and seasonal migration. It investigates how de facto women-heads of households (WHHs) are changing a resilient crop-sharing system in absence of adequate access to productive assets, formal training or experience in farming, and while contributing labour to farming and coping with gendered demands on their time. Based on qualitative inquiry in one of the poorest parts of South Asia, the Eastern Gangetic Plains, the paper shows that a section of WHHs are replacing sharecropping arrangements with fixed-value rental arrangements that resemble commercial contracts. The paper ends with a discussion on the implications of this emerging development.

TI  - The dynamics of rubber production in Malaysia: Potential impacts, challenges and proposed interventions
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The rubber industry is one of the largest contributors to Malaysia?s GDP and is economically important for the country. However, production has been declining over the last few decades. Similarly, this has also occurred in other crops such as cocoa. The decline in production adversely impacts the livelihood of local rubber smallholder farmers. To understand why this decline in rubber production has occurred, we used a systems thinking approach to analyze the underlying feedback mechanisms controlling rubber production. In addition to secondary data, we conducted focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with various actors and experts in the rubber supply chain across Peninsular Malaysia in order to develop a dynamic hypothesis that explains the decline in rubber production over time. Our analysis shows that feedback loops between global demand and supply, national rubber price, and smallholder farmer income determines rubber production at the local scale. In general, the lack of compliance and participation in the global exports restriction policy, insufficient national price incentives, and the absence of national import regulations have kept rubber prices low, leading to low profitability for smallholder farmers. This has caused smallholder farmers to reduce tapping activities and farm maintenance. Some have left rubber farming altogether. This has reduced rubber plantation area and rubber production. We propose several policy improvements to address the issue: (1) enhance the monitoring of rubber supply in the global market through international collaboration; (2) increase domestic rubber consumption through government projects and incentives and eventually follow this up with strict rubber import regulations; and (3) increase smallholder farmer income through the enhancement of government incentives and R&D, formation of cooperatives, application of crop diversification, and obtaining support from the private sector. The findings of this study are also applicable to other rubber-producing countries due to the similar dynamics that exist in the rubber production system globally. The approach adopted in this study can better facilitate engagement with rubber stakeholders, especially smallholder farmers, and inform the formulation of effective smallholderoriented policies.

TI  - Technical Efficiency and Profitability of Cassava Production in Delta State: A Stochastic Frontier Production Function Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF TEKIRDAG AGRICULTURE FACULTY-TEKIRDAG ZIRAAT FAKULTESI DERGISI
AB  - The study empirically examines the production efficiency of cassava farmers in Delta State, Nigeria, using stochastic frontier analysis. A multi-stage sampling procedure was used to select 120 farmers. The result showed that 68.3% of cassava farmers fell within the age range of 40-59 years, majority (63.3%) of them were females, 69.2% had formal education, 51.7% had 6-10 years farming experience, 62.5% had household size of 6-10 persons, 70% did not belong to cooperative society, 88.3% of them had farm size between 0.1-0.9 ha, 76.7% did not have access to credit and 74.2% also did not have extension contact. A mean technical efficiency of 67% was recorded. The results imply that the average efficiency of cassava production could be improved by 33% through better use of existing resources and technology. The result showed that the return to scale was 1.306.The gamma coefficient was 0.86, implying that 86% of variation of cassava output from the production frontier was accounted by the technical inefficiency of the farmers. The major factors which influenced the farmers technical efficiency were farm size, planting material and capital while farming experience, level of education, access to credit, gender, age of farmer and household size exerted a significant effect on their inefficiency level. The major problems faced by the farmers were inadequate finance, inaccessibility to credit, inadequate access to improved varieties and high cost of inputs. The study deduced that the gross margin and net farm incomes were 155,726.34 a and 147,464.84 with BCR of 2.38, suggesting that cassava production is profitable. It is recommended that more farmers should venture into cassava production as a means of wealth creation and employment generation.

TI  - Explaining the performance of contract farming in Ghana: The role of self-efficacy and social capital
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Self-efficacy is the belief of an individual to have the ability to be successful in a given domain. Social capital is the economic value of a person's relationships. In the context of this study, self-efficacy is the belief of a farmer to be able to improve her income with contract farming, which increases her actual ability. Social capital increases the ability of the farmers through social support.
   We surveyed 400 smallholder pineapple farmers and find that both self-efficacy and social capital are decisive for their successful integration into contract farming. To identify causal effects, we use two instruments, which are also of interest on their own: the historical presence of (1) cocoa cooperatives and (2) Christian missionary schools. During Ghana's colonial period, the British established cocoa cooperatives, which differed in their performance as a function of biogeographic factors and thus persistently shaped the self-efficacy of the farmers. Roughly at the same time, Christian missionaries established missionary schools, which impacted the traditional societies so that social capital decreased. The finding that self-efficacy and social capital are still shaped by historic variables could indicate that these variables are only slowly changing, or that they only do so in the absence of policy intervention. The latter raises the possibility that effective policies could benefit from strong reinforcing feedbacks once self-efficacy and social capital improve. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The regulatory effect of cooperation degree in increasing tobacco farmers' income by mitigating production risk shocks
T2  - ANNALS OF PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - Context: Different from general agriculture, tobacco agriculture in China adopts the production mode of farmers' cooperatives to instruct farmers to engage in tobacco agricultural production under a policy of tobacco control. In addition to providing convenience for industry technical standardization, the policy goal aims to cope with the impact of production risk shocks and ultimately ensure the modernization and transformation of the tobacco industry and the stability of income of farmers.Objective: This study intends to explore the influence mechanism of the different degrees of cooperation and participation in cooperatives on the income of tobacco farmers from the perspective of risk shocks.Methods: Through the quantitative methods of the OLS regression model, hierarchical regression model and moderation model, this paper analyzes the data of 393 farmers engaged in tobacco agricultural production in Shaanxi Province obtained from survey and empirically analyzes the relationship between the degree of cooperation and participation in cooperatives and income. Interaction terms between risk shocks and cooperation are introduced to verify the regulatory effect of participation in tobacco farmers' professional cooperatives on mitigating risk shocks and improving agricultural income.Results and conclusions: The results show that while risk shocks, including natural risks, market risks and policy risks, negatively affect the income of tobacco farmers, the degree of cooperation and participation has a significant positive effect on the income of tobacco farmers, and the degree of peasant households' participation in the professional cooperative of tobacco farmers as a moderator variable has a regulatory effect on mitigating the impact of risk shocks on the income of tobacco farmers. The mechanism of action is that tobacco farmers participate in cooperatives to a higher degree, which can further promote the association of farmers and jointly resist risk shocks by reducing production costs, improving the technical level, and strengthening risk prevention and other measures to improve the income level.Significance: It would be helpful to encourage tobacco farmers to take the initiative to participate in the daily management-related affairs and decisions of cooperatives, strengthen technical training, obey cooperative management, and actively respond to cooperative policies to effectively resist risk shocks and stabilize farmers' income level and family welfare.

TI  - Rental markets for cultivated land and agricultural investments in China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to empirically track the progress and consequences of the emergence of cultivated land markets in China since 2000. We draw on a set of nationwide, household-level panel data (for 2000 and 2008) and find that the markets for cultivated land rental have emerged robustly. According to our data, 19 of China's cultivated land was rented in farm operators in 2008. We also find that the nature of China's cultivated land rental contracts has become more formal and lengthened the period of time that the tenant is able to cultivate the rented-in plots. While there may be benefits for lessors and tenants, our data show that there are falling rates of investment in organic manure. The farmers in our sample have reduced organic manure use from 13 tons/ha in 2000 to 5 tons/ha in 2008. Part of this fall is due to the rise of cultivated land rental markets. The analysis, however, does not find that improved property rights in cultivated land rental affect investment largely because property rights have largely been established by 2000, the first year of our sample. Our results, however, also show that there are forces that appear to be mitigating the negative consequences of rising cultivated land rental. After holding constant initial rental rates and other factors, we find that the gap between investment in organic manure in own land and rented-in land is narrowing. One interpretation of our findings is that if policymakers can find ways to even further strengthen the rights of lessors and tenants as well as lengthen contract periods, farmerseven those that rentwill invest more in their land, because they will be able to capture the returns to their investments.

TI  - Contribution of savings and credit cooperatives to food crop production in Swaziland: A case study of smallholder farmers
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - Using primary data collected in Ludzeludze and Bhekinkhosi/Mliba RDAs from 80 smallholder farmers in the 2008 cropping season, the study used a Cobb-Douglas production function model to analyze the contribution of savings and credit cooperatives to food production in Swaziland. The results from the analysis indicated that on average, members of savings and credit cooperative societies used capital worth E 6185.00, compared to E 4520.00 that was used by non-members on crop production. Households who are members of savings and credit cooperative societies had an average maize yield of about 2.6 times that of households who are non-members. Similarly, average yields of potatoes for members is about 2.7 times those recorded by non-member households and average yields of beans of about 2.2 times than those obtained by non-members. The analysis reveals that households who are members of savings and credit cooperative societies produced more output per hectare of maize, sweet potatoes and beans than those households who are non-members. The high yields for members of savings and credit cooperative societies could be attributed to their ability to spend more on improved seeds, pesticides, fertilizers and other farm inputs. All the independent variables in the production model were found to explain 75.3% of the variation in the total amount of food crop produced by the farmers. The regression coefficient of capital used in food crop production indicates that all things being equal a 1% increase in capital used the value of food crops produced would increase by 0.34%, while a 1% in increase in labour and in land would result in 0.088% decrease and 1.027% increase in output respectively. The study has shown that savings and credit cooperatives play an important role in improving agricultural production. Hence there is a need to encourage farmers to join and save with cooperatives in order to have access to microfinance and improve their production through the use of improved seeds, technology and fertilizers.

TI  - Does Farm Size Expansion Improve the Agricultural Environment? Evidence from Apple Farmers in China
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Farmland environmental pollution has put greater pressure on the sustainability of agricultural production systems. Exploring the relationship between farm size and environmental pollution in agriculture can help provide realistic guidance for stakeholders. In this study, the research data from apple farmers in China were used to measure the environmental pollutant emissions caused by apple production using the life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The mediating effect model was used to examine the mechanisms and pathways by which farm size affects the environmental effects of apple production and to identify the mediating effects of fertilizer, pesticide, and machinery input intensity. Finally, a heterogeneity analysis was conducted to illustrate the impact of participation in agricultural cooperatives on the environmental performance of apple production for smallholder farmers. The results showed that the apple production system's negative environmental impacts from the agricultural material production phase were more significant compared to the farming phase, with a contribution potential of 56.50%. Farm size directly impacts the environmental effects of apple production, and there is a U-shaped trend between the two, implying that from the perspective of environmental effects, larger farm size is not better. There were some mediating effects in the paths of farm size on the environmental effects, and the largest effect was fertilizer input intensity with a full mediating effect; the second largest effect was machinery input intensity with a partial mediating effect, and the mediating effect accounted for 15.50-15.89% of the total effect; the mediating effect of pesticide input intensity was not significant. In addition, the study also found that joining agricultural cooperatives was beneficial in promoting the improvement of the negative environmental impact caused by apple production. These findings provide insights into optimizing farm inputs for apple production and identifying the appropriate farm size to alleviate multiple environmental impacts, intending to make a marginal contribution to promoting sustainable development of the apple industry in China also providing the research evidence for the comparative study of the environmental burdens of apple production in China and other countries in the world.

TI  - Input usage and cost analysis in capia pepper production: Canakkale Province, Turkey sample
T2  - CUSTOS E AGRONEGOCIO ON LINE
AB  - This research was carried out in Canakkale, where the most capia pepper production is carried out in Turkey. The main purpose of the research is to analyse the production of capia pepper economically in the light of agricultural business science. The original data used in the research were obtained by applying a questionnaire from 76 agricultural enterprises determined by the "stratified sampling method". According to the results of the research, the average age of business owners is 43.57 years, and the household size is 3.72 people in the enterprises examined. The professional experience of the producers in capia pepper production was found to be 17.78 years. Capia pepper production activity ranks first with a share of 34% in the herbal production pattern and 47% in the vegetable production value of the enterprises examined. It has been determined that the average capia pepper production area per farm was 15.48 da, and the yield was 3094.57 kg da(-1). In order to reach the average yield in one decare area in capia pepper production; 4454 seedlings, 44.51 kg of pure fertilizer, 485 ml of agricultural pesticides, 3.26 hours of machine pulling power, 19 lt of diesel fuel and 100 hours of manpower are needed. In order to gain an income of 2936(sic) capia pepper from unit area in enterprises in terms of monetary size; seedlings worth 1943(sic), pure fertilizers worth 253(sic), agricultural pesticides worth 105(sic), machine drawing power worth 382(sic), diesel fuel worth 2312(sic) and human labour worth 1387(sic) are needed. The average sales price of capia pepper was determined as 0.99(sic) kg(-1) in the enterprises surveyed, and the highest average sales price was found as 1.19(sic) kg(-1) in the enterprises in the second group. Considering the average of enterprises; capia pepper production cost in per area was calculated as 5399.95(sic) da(-1), production value as 3063.62(sic) da(-1) and gross profit as -1934.92(sic) da(-1). The results obtained in the research showed that capia pepper production in the research area was not profitable in 2020. Likewise, the sale price of capia pepper in 2020 was at the lowest level of recent years, and this had a negative impact on the product income. In order for the capia pepper production to be profitable in the examined enterprises, it is of great significance that the agricultural unions or cooperatives establish cold storage in the region and that the producer unions or cooperatives should make their presence felt during the marketing phase of the product. To create such a structure is seen as a significant phenomenon that can ensure price stability in the product.

TI  - Study on the Pricing of Water Rights Transaction between Irrigation Water Users Based on Cooperative Game in China
T2  - WATER
AB  - China's water rights transaction is still in the initial stage of development. There is no systematic pricing method for water rights transactions between farmers. This paper puts forward a pricing model of water rights transactions among farmers in water-deficient areas. The price of water rights transaction consists of cost price and earnings price. The earnings price is determined by studying the crop water production function, calculating the crop's marginal benefit of the two parties, and combining the Cooperative Game Theory. Finally, the pricing model was applied to the water rights transactions among the farmers of Hetao Irrigation District of Bayannaoer City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Results showed that under the A4 trading strategy, the overall income increased without losing the interests of any farmer. The increasing income of the three farmer households N-1, N-2, and N-3 after the alliance was 8.14 thousand dollars, 4.66 thousand dollars, and 20.33 thousand dollars, respectively, and the water rights transaction prices of N-3 and N-1, N-2 were respectively 0.485 $/m(3), 0.565 $/m(3). It is estimated that the model can provide a scientific basis for water rights trading between farmers and the efficient use of water resources.

TI  - Measuring the Effectiveness of the Project Management Information System (PMIS) on the Financial Wellness of Rural Households in the Hill Districts of Uttarakhand, India: An IS-FW Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The study aims to measure the effectiveness of the project management information system (PMIS) and its impact on financial wellness in rural areas. The study uses DeLone and McLean's updated information success model to measure the net impacts of the PMIS on the community. The dynamics between the PMIS and financial wellness have not yet been clarified, as the available literature on the concerned domain is very limited; thus, further research is required to report the effect of the PMIS on financial wellness. A total of 628 samples were analyzed from 666 collected through structured questionnaires and stratified sampling from 21 hill blocks from the hills of Uttarakhand. Exploratory-confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis were both conducted using SPSS and AMOS. The study found that PMIS quality, information quality, and service quality are significantly important for the PMIS, and its impact on the net benefits derived from PMIS was studied. The results also reveal that the net benefits of the system impact the financial behavior and financial attitudes of SHGs and cooperative members, consequently significantly impacting financial wellness. This study proposes and tests the information system (IS) financial wellness (FW) model for community-based development programs in the lines of the logical framework approach and the stimulus-organism-response framework.

TI  - Irrigation and collective action: A study in method with reference to the Shiwalik Hills, Haryana
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
AB  - In recent years decentralized development approaches have gained prominence in the agricultural sector. A host of community based watershed management projects have been implemented that encourage community organizations to undertake management of previously government controlled irrigation systems and forests. Community organizations have been given the responsibility of managing water distribution, collection of irrigation service fees and undertaking routine maintenance of irrigation infrastructure. In this context, analysis of irrigation management has concluded that groups that are relatively homogeneous may fare better than heterogeneous groups in facilitating collective action. However, this article argues that analysis of the influence of group heterogeneity on collective action is complicated because of its multi-dimensional nature and the presence of non-monotonic effects in mechanisms linking heterogeneity and collective outcomes. The article discusses the importance of context specification in analysis of group heterogeneity through a discussion of elements of a joint management contract in Haryana (India), identification of key variables with a potential to explain collective action in irrigation management and construction of household endowment and water interest scores to account for the influence of group heterogeneity in facilitating collective action. In the process of applying household endowment and water interest scores, the authors highlight the role of local ecological variation and non-farm employment in influencing collective action. Proper specification of local context enables the researchers to rely on household endowment and water interest scores to predict conflicts and potential for irrigation service provision and compliance with irrigation service rules.

TI  - Supermarket contracts, opportunity cost and trade-offs, and farm household welfare: Panel data evidence from Kenya
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - While previous studies analyzed the welfare effects of smallholder participation in supermarket channels, little is known about the effects over time of supplying supermarkets on farm household incomes and diets, possible trade-offs, and opportunity costs of supermarkets on different income sources. We use panel data from smallholder vegetable farmers in Kenya to address these research gaps. The results show that supermarket contracts increase overall income by 61% and the dietary diversity score of nutritious foods by 4%, on average. Supermarket contracts also increase farm income without sacrificing income from other sources. In terms of participation dynamics, supermarket stayers and dropouts achieve overall income gains, but newcomers do not immediately benefit, due to their huge initial capital investment. Supermarket participation is not a panacea for all smallholder marketing and livelihood challenges but benefits farmers who can meet contractual requirements. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Two-Step Econometric Estimation of Covariates of Side Selling: The Case of Coffee Cooperatives in Southwest Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - Despite their apparent economic benefit to smallholder farmers, cooperatives are vulnerable to the problem of side selling. Using cross-sectional household data and Cragg's regression model, we identified the determinants of side selling by coffee cooperative farmers in southwest Ethiopia. The bootstrapping technique was applied to extract average partial effects from the model coefficients. Certified, elder and educated farmers who have off-farm income and trust in the cooperative leadership have been found to side-sell significantly less. Nonetheless, cooperative group size and late payment favoured more side selling. Based on these findings, possible interventions are highlighted for improving cooperative members' commitment and the performance of coffee cooperatives in the region.

TI  - What lies behind income inequality and income mobility in India? Implications and the way forward
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine income inequality and income mobility, which have been central to understanding India's recent economic development.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper uses the first two waves of the India Human Development Survey data for the year 2004-2005 and 2011-2012 to analyze income inequality and income mobility using longitudinal data, and is the first to do so at a nationally representative level. In this research paper, we address three related research questions: How have been the patterns of income mobility in India? What are the trends, levels and sources of income inequality in India? and finally And What is the structure of household income mobility?
   Findings The paper examines the trends, levels, sources and factors of income inequality and income mobility in India between 2005 and 2012. The results further show the case for high persistence at the top of income distribution but lower persistence at the bottom.
   Research limitations/implications Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack spatial analysis. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further.
   Practical implications The paper suggests that, in the end, the nature of longer-term well-being is crucial to designing policy interventions to effectively tackle inequality, and economic mobility can be seen as an avenue to long-term equality.
   Social implications This study can further be extended to look at polarization issues at the national and sub-national levels.
   Originality/value This paper shows the analytical framework of additive decomposition of income mobility out of two sources, namely mobility due to the transfer of income within given structure and mobility due to economic growth or contraction in rural and urban India.

TI  - Impacts of Technology Training Provided by Agricultural Cooperatives on Farmers' Adoption of Biopesticides in China
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - As pesticide abuse becomes increasingly serious worldwide, it is necessary to pay attention to the biopesticide adoption behavior of agricultural producers. It is worth verifying whether agricultural cooperatives, as training organizations sharing the same social network with farmers, can promote the adoption of biopesticides through their technology diffusion function. Therefore, based on survey data of 837 citrus producers in Sichuan Province, China, the IV-probit regression model and a mediation effects model were used to empirically test the impact of technical training on farmers' adoption of biopesticides in addition to its mechanism, considering the farmers' perception of technology as the mediation variable. The results show that (a) participation in technical training can significantly enhance the probability of the adoption of biopesticides; (b) farmers' perceptions of biopesticides' economic and health benefits play a partial mediating role in the relationship; and (c) technical training has more significant effects on biopesticides adoption behavior for a household with higher-educated household heads, lower household total income, and smaller household size, relative to their counterparts. This study provides evidence for establishing relevant policy to encourage the full adoption of the technical training function of agricultural cooperatives and popularize the use of biopesticides.

T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This paper examines why farm households seek informal loans in Piura, Peru, where formal lenders offer loans at lower interest rates. A panel data econometric analysis reveals that the informal sector serves various types of clients: households excluded from the formal sector but also households that prefer informal loans because of lower transaction costs or lower risk. An in-depth examination of contract terms and loan technologies permits an accurate comparison of effective loan costs and contractual risk across sectors and reveals that proximity and economics of scope enjoyed by informal lenders enable them to substitute information-intensive screening and monitoring for contractual risk and supply these various types of clients.

TI  - Who benefited from the New Rural Cooperative Medical System in China? A case study on Anhui Province
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: The goal of the New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NCMS) is to decrease the financial burden and improve the health of rural areas. The purpose of the present study is to determine how government subsidies vary between poorer and wealthier groups, especially in low-income regions in rural China.
   Methods: The distribution, amount, and equity of government subsidies delivered via NCMS to rural residents at different economic levels were assessed using benefit-incidence analysis, concentration index, Kakwani index, Gini index, Lorenz curve, and concentration curve. Household and health institution surveys were conducted in 2010, covering 9701 residents. Household socio-economic status, healthcare costs, out-of-pocket payments, and utilization information were collected in household interviews, and reimbursement policy was provided by institutional survey.
   Results: The government subsidy concentration index was -0.055 for outpatients and 0.505 for inpatients; and the outpatient and inpatient subsidy Kakwani indexes were -0.376 and 0.184, respectively. The poorest 20 % of populations received 3.4 % of the total subsidy output; while the wealthiest 20 % received 54.3 %. The results showed that the distribution of outpatient subsidies was equitable, but the hospital subsidies disproportionally benefited wealthier people.
   Conclusions: Wealthier people benefited more than poorer people from the NCMS in terms of inpatient and total subsidies. For outpatients, the subsidies were unrelated to ability to pay. This contradicts the common belief that the NCMS does not exacerbate benefit inequity. Long-term policy is required to tackle this problem, specifically of redesign the NCMS reimbursement system.

TI  - The resurgence of agricultural mechanisation in Ethiopia: rhetoric or real commitment?
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - Ethiopia's agricultural development strategies bypassed smallholder mechanisation for decades. Mechanisation returned to the policy agenda in 2013 but recent pro-mechanisation rhetoric lacks operational commitments. Based on primary and secondary data, this paper traces the policies and policy narratives that have led to low mechanisation, and finds that mechanisation was deprioritised on the grounds that Ethiopia is labour- and land-abundant, but short of capital. With policy encouraging multiple cropping, but farming vulnerable to climate change, the paper argues for the development of a market for mechanisation, including mechanisation service provision through private and cooperative agents, to enhance smallholder access to mechanisation and unleash human energy.

TI  - Analyzing Potato Market Participation, Market Surplus, and Market Outlet Choice on Small Farm Household Level in Lemo District, Southern Ethiopia
T2  - ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - This study was aimed to analyze potato market participation, market surplus, and market outlet choice in Lemo District of southern Ethiopia. To achieve the objective, primary and secondary data sources were employed and 202 potato producers were selected following simple random sampling techniques. The collected data were analyzed by using Heckman second-stage and multivariate probit models to identify factors that determine potato market participation decision and potato farmer market outlet choice, respectively. The Heckman's first-stage (probit) result indicates that education level, sex, membership in the cooperative, distance to the nearest market, remittent from family members, own transportation facilities, seed types, frequency of extension contact, lagged market price, and amount of credit that farm household used for potato production significantly (P <) determined producers' participation in potato market. Heckman second-stage (OLS) result showed that education level, cooperative membership, family size, total cropland size, oxen owned, types of seed, and lagged market price were significantly (P <) determined potato marketed surplus. Multivariate probit results showed the probability to choose wholesalers (P <), retailers (P <), collectors (P <), and consumers (P <) market outlets who were significantly affected by age, educational levels, sex, farm experiences, distance to near market, family size, remittance, land size, product supplied to the market, own transport facility, and extension service. Therefore, we recommend that the government and concerned stakeholders should focus on promoting improved potato seed, encouraging education, promoting farmers' cooperatives, empowering females, strengthening rural-urban infrastructure, and protecting informal labor trading.

TI  - Privatisation, empowerment and accountability: What are the policy implications for establishing effective farmer organisations?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Weak institutional development and information flows have constrained the extent to which the smallholder farming sector in developing countries can significantly drive growth and poverty reduction. This is despite widely implemented economic liberalisation policies focussing on market efficiency. Farmer organisations are viewed as a potential means of addressing public and private institutional failure but this has frequently been limited by inequalities in access to power and information. This article investigates two issues that have received little research attention to date: what role downward accountability plays in enabling farmer organisations to improve services and markets, and what influences the extent to which downward accountability is achieved. Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA), one of the largest farmer organisations in the world (>400,000 farmers) is examined alongside wider literature. Mixed methods were used including key informant interviews, and eight months of participant observation followed by a questionnaire survey. The article concludes that without effective downward accountability farmer organisations can become characterised by institutions and mechanisms that favour elites, restricted weak coordination and regulation, and manipulated information flows. This in turn reduces individuals' incentives to invest. If farmer organisations are to realise their potential as a means of enabling the smallholder sector to significantly contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction, policy and research needs to address key factors which influence accountability including: how to ensure initial processes in formation of farmer organisations establish appropriate structures and rules; strong state regulation to enhance corporate accountability; transparent information provision regarding actions of farmer organisation leaders; and the role independent non-government organisations can play. Consequently attention needs to focus on developing means of legitimising rights, building poor people's capacity to challenge exclusion, and moving from rights to obligations regarding information provision.

TI  - Membership of Chinese Farmer Specialized Cooperatives and Direct Subsidies for Farmer Households: A Multi-Province Data Study
T2  - CHINESE ECONOMY
AB  - The introduction of direct subsidies to farming households and the development of farmer cooperatives has provided two important approaches to China's twenty-first century food policy challenges. However, research undertaken largely separates and focuses on subsidies or cooperatives. This neglects their interaction and complementarities. This article seeks to rectify this omission using a survey from 35 farmer specialized cooperatives (FSCs) and 561 farming households in 16 provinces, based on a two-stage treatment effect model. The findings suggest FSCs have become important organizations that improve farmers' net income. Moreover, usage of agricultural machinery and direct subsidies also result in higher net income, though they have little impact on farmers' machinery investment. The results provide an evidence source that contributes to debate concerning government subsidy policy. Policy may act more like an income transfer program, since it has little impact on farmers' investment in agriculture. The study also highlights that there are complementary effects between FSCs and direct subsidies, and that China's cooperative policy integrated with direct subsidies could be progressive.

TI  - The effects of China's New Cooperative Medical Scheme on accessibility and affordability of healthcare services: an empirical research in Liaoning Province
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: China's New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), launched in 2003, was intended to prevent the impoverishment due to catastrophic illness costs. Previous studies have been conducted on the "design flows" of the NCMS, for example, the irrational insurance benefit package. But after several years of implementation, very little has been known about the improvements made by the NCMS and rural residents' attitudes toward it. This article specifically focused on the improvements of healthcare services and the enrollees' choices of providers since the implementation of the NCMS in Liaoning province.
   Methods: We conducted a one-on-one interview with healthcare officials in order to get a better understanding of the NCMS policies of the local area. We conducted a door-to-door survey in 3 counties, 21 villages and 602 households to gauge population characteristics, respondents' healthcare preferences, satisfaction levels with providers, and their attitudes towards designated healthcare institutions.
   Results: We found that 43.6% of the respondents believed the NCMS brought more convenience to receive healthcare services. 35.2% of the rural residents thought the NCMS work ineffectively, mainly due to the high healthcare costs. 72.3% of the respondents preferred the county hospitals when they got severe diseases, mainly for the reason of better skills and more advanced equipment, while they preferred village clinics (56.5%) and township hospitals (23.2%) when they got minor diseases mainly for the reason of convenience.
   Conclusion: We concluded that the NCMS improved the situation of hard to receive healthcare services but did not reduce the high healthcare fees. Furthermore, participants were unsatisfied with the NCMS designated hospitals. Based on our findings, a number of remedial actions were proposed, including redistributing healthcare resources, developing more domestic medical equipment to lower the treatment costs, and establishing a new talent flow mode.

TI  - Parameters that Motivate Table Olive Farmers To Buy Agricultural Insurance: The Case of Western Turkey
T2  - ERWERBS-OBSTBAU
AB  - Defining components that affect agricultural insurance contract decisions is indispensable to the sustainability of table olive cultivation in the region. The Akhisar district is located within the borders of Manisa province, a region in Turkey in which traditional, and the most famous, table olive varieties are grown. This study explores parameters that predict the decisions of farmers in this district to purchase agricultural insurance and identifies perceptions of agricultural insurance in the region. A survey was conducted among 121 purposefully selected farmers. Some farmers' sociodemographic characteristics and their households were identified using basic descriptive statistics, such as arithmetic means and percentage rates, and factors that affect farmers' decisions to buy agricultural insurance were defined using binary logistic regression. Although table olive farmers could insure their products against risk by buying full hail and frost packages within the scope of crop insurance, the desired success with agricultural insurance has not been achieved. Although the agricultural insurance that covers farmers who grow table olives remains insufficient, it still plays a role in patterns of agricultural production in the region, results in greater income than other agricultural products, and contributes to the government's premiums for agricultural insurance. Future studies should expand insurance practices to improve farmers' perceptions of agricultural insurance, especially regarding drought yield insurance for perennial fruit trees, including table olives.

TI  - Love on the Rocks: Domestic Violence and Alcohol Abuse in Rural Mexico
T2  - B E JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS & POLICY
AB  - I use experimental data for the evaluation of Oportunidades to study the determinants of domestic violence and alcohol abuse. The program, a combination of cash transfers to women and human capital investments, decreases husbands' alcohol abuse by 15% and changes their aggressive behavior depending on transfer size, husbands' education, and spousal age gap. While small transfers decrease violence by 37% for all households, large transfers increase the aggressive behavior of husbands with traditional views of gender roles, probably because their wife's entitlement to a large transfer threatens their identity. This evidence rejects standard unitary, collective, and bargaining models for this latter group of households. It also shows that, while targeting women as recipients of micro-credit or other welfare programs may have additional beneficial effects by reducing alcoholism and domestic violence in most households, the risk of violence may increase for some.

TI  - Determinants of profitability of broiler production in the Ngaka Modiri Molema District, North West Province, South Africa
T2  - ASIA LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - The study examined the determinants of profitability of broiler production in Ngaka Modiri Molema District of North West Province, South Africa. A total of 100 small and emerging broiler farmers were selected from the district and a structured questionnaire was used to collect data and analyzed using version 21 of Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) computer programme Graphs, histograms and tables were used to present frequency of the variables. About 54% of the farmers were males; 45% of them in the 50-59 years age category and majority (70%) of the farmers were married. The results also show that 98% of the farmers worked on their personal lands; 69% of the broiler farmers were full time farmers; 79% of them own land sizes of 6 to 10 hectares; all of the farmers bought day-old chick for fattening; 73% of them produced on small scale; 99% of the farmers paid R5 per day old chick and 85% of the farmers' families assisted in the running of the farms; 61% of the farmers made use of hired labor. The majority (84%) of the broiler farmers used personal capital; 93% of the farmers sold the broilers by themselves; 96% of the farmers found it difficult to enter the high value markets; 90% of the farmers experienced financial problems; all the farmers (100%) had security problems and animal health/poultry disease problems on the farms. Significant determinants following the regression analysis were:educational level (t = 2.022, p = 0.029), household size (t = 1.897, p = 0.061), membership of cooperative (t = 2.987, p = 0.004) and sources of labor (t = 3.238,p = 0.002). These findings imply that the farmers need more skills training, should be encouraged to be members of cooperative and that all the farmers should source labor.

TI  - Contracting-in management to strengthen publicly financed primary health services-The experience of Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - HEALTH POLICY
AB  - Objectives: In response to low utilization of primary health services in rural areas, the Government of Punjab contracted with a local non-governmental organization (NGO) to manage the basic health units in one district.
   Methods: To evaluate the performance of the contractor, health facility surveys, household surveys, and routinely collected information were used to compare the experimental district (Rahim Yar Khan, RYK) with a contiguous and equally poor district (Bahawalpur, BWP).
   Results: The evaluation found that contracting led to more than a 50% increase in out-patient visits in RYK compared to BWP. There was also increased satisfaction of the community with health services. Technical quality of care was equally poor in both districts and contracting also had little effect on the coverage of preventive services. The latter was likely the result of the NGO not being given managerial responsibility over vaccinators and other community health workers.
   Conclusions: Despite methodological limitations, this study found that contracting in management achieved important goals at the same cost to the Government, implying a large increase in efficiency. Contracting in management worked reasonably well in this context and has now been significantly expanded. The approach provides a plausible means for large-scale improvements of poorly performing primary health care systems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness analysis of local energy management based on urban-rural cooperation in China
T2  - APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB  - The urban and rural areas usually illustrate distinguishing yet complementary features from natural, energy, economic and other aspects; thus, it is beneficial to consider them in a systematic and cooperative manner so as to develop a low-carbon society in the local area. In this study, the paths toward regional de-carbonization are indicated by conceptualizing systematic "urban-rural cooperation" that creates regional circulation of energy resources. As an illustrative example, an investigation has been conducted of assumed local energy systems for a model city. By developing a bottom-up energy system optimization model to include not only cost minimization but also emissions minimization, the proposed wide urban rural energy systems are examined from both economic and environmental viewpoints. According to the simulation results, the energy system based on urban rural mutual cooperation is the best option from both economic and environmental viewpoints, which results in cost-effective CO2 emissions reduction up to 50% below current level. In addition, by endowing an economic value to the reduced CO2 emissions through the local carbon price, the economic and environmental benefits for urban and rural areas can be shared and balanced between both sides.

TI  - Household Forests and Their Role in Rural Livelihood: A Case Study in Shangnan County, Northern China
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - With the implementation of collective forest tenure reform in China in the 1980s, increasing the area under household forest has great importance in terms of forest production, environmental protection and farmers' income growth. The scale and usage of household forests is a critical issue that concerns the methods and efficiency of forest management. By conducting a socio-economic survey of 175 households, this paper examines the status of household forestry as well as its utilization in Shangnan County, northern China, and the way in which farmers and their local forest authority interact. Approximately 80 % of households were found to have forest land. Among households which had forestry, nearly half had a forest area of 1 mu (0.07 ha) or less. Fuelwood for household use was the main product of household forests. About 70 % of households regarded fuelwood as their main energy source. Socio-economic factors including financial situation, household size, occupation and educational level of householder were not significantly correlated with the energy choice or the amount of fuelwood consumed. In order to improve the development of household forests, it is necessary to promote better communication between households and forest authorities. The coppice system appears to be a useful forest management strategy because it not only maintains continuous forest cover but also satisfies the high demand for fuelwood in this county.

TI  - Inequality and small landholdings: Path dependence, land use and wellbeing
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - China economic reform was initiated from rural land tenure reforms, leading up to four decades of fast economic growth. Small but more unequal land holding has been viewed as a dilemma for future development. Using data from rural households in three provinces, this paper attempts to quantitatively measure and examine land holding inequality between farmland and woodland across different regions. It was argued that the paths of land tenure reforms could play an important role: all farmland was allocated to households via administrative mechanism according to household size at the beginning of the economic reforms while woodland was allocated to households from the collective using market mechanism. The inequality between farmland and woodland also come from land uses because farmland is primarily used for food production for own consumption whereas woodland is used to produce products for sale. The determinants of the current holding size of land were compared and investigated. The role of wellbeing like household income is found statistically significant in forestland but not farmland. In contrast, the size of household is found statistically significant in farmland but not forestland.

TI  - The diversity of gendered adaptation strategies to climate change of Indian farmers: A feminist intersectional approach
T2  - AMBIO
AB  - This paper examines climate change adaptation and gender issues through an application of a feminist intersectional approach. This approach permits the identification of diverse adaptation responses arising from the existence of multiple and fragmented dimensions of identity (including gender) that intersect with power relations to shape situation-specific interactions between farmers and ecosystems. Based on results from contrasting research cases in Bihar and Uttarakhand, India, this paper demonstrates, inter alia, that there are geographically determined gendered preferences and adoption strategies regarding adaptation options and that these are influenced by the socio-ecological context and institutional dynamics. Intersecting identities, such as caste, wealth, age and gender, influence decisions and reveal power dynamics and negotiation within the household and the community, as well as barriers to adaptation among groups. Overall, the findings suggest that a feminist intersectional approach does appear to be useful and worth further exploration in the context of climate change adaptation. In particular, future research could benefit from more emphasis on a nuanced analysis of the intra-gender differences that shape adaptive capacity to climate change.

TI  - Attitudinal Asymmetries and the Lender-Borrower Relationship: Survey Results on Farm Lending in Shandong, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - This paper addresses the problem of social interactions and the lender-borrower relationship by measuring the disconnect between borrowers and lenders across a wide range of lending-related attributes. The degree by which lenders and borrowers connect disconnect depends on whether lenders' and borrowers' perceptions across these attributes are symmetric or asymmetric. We compare field survey results from 120 loan officers at Rural Credit Cooperatives (RCCs) in China's coastal Shandong province, and pair them with an existing survey on identical questions to 394 farm households in the same region. Pairing lenders' perception towards borrowers regarding RCC microcredit lending mechanism, against borrowers' perception towards lenders and how themselves were perceived by lenders in the same regards, we observe on many dimensions a disconnect between them in the context of lenders' "care" towards borrowers, loan rejection, memberships of RCC and group guarantee, lending concerns, cost of borrowing, reasons for default, credit rationing, and lending preferences. This research provides financial institutions with outreach mechanisms to borrowers, while also training lenders to borrowers' sensitivities.

TI  - Achieving Sustainability and Development through Collective Action? An Empirical Analysis of the Impact of the Bore Pool Sharing Program on Farm Incomes and Crop Choices
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Repeated droughts in agriculture have promoted intensive reliance upon groundwater resources, thereby exacerbating the already stressed groundwater reservoir situations all across the globe. This has also resulted in increased inequality among farmers by allowing those with better physical assets, such as borewells, to extract water at the cost of less affluent farmers. As a response, bore pool sharing collective arrangements were introduced in some parts of India, with the intention of slowing down the rate of groundwater depletion and helping improve the livelihoods of the worst affected farmers. Such arrangements work through promoting collective management of groundwater resources by providing critical and timely irrigation to rain-fed crops and through dis-incentivizing the cultivation of high water consuming crops. We investigate the impact of bore pool sharing programs on crop incomes and cropping patterns of the participating households in South India. A Probit-2SLS model and Propensity score matching method are used to evaluate the impact of such programs while controlling for self-selection biases. Results indicate that farmers' participation in bore pool sharing collectives is positively associated with their crop incomes. However, contrary to expectation, the share of high water-intensive-crops also increases with participation. In addition, share of water-intensive crops is higher for a collective group with a higher ratio of bore wells to number of participating households. Finally, farmers within the pool with multiple past failed bore well sinking attempts tend to extract more water, thereby threatening the sustainability of the groundwater as well as the livelihoods of the farming community.

TI  - Has Property Rights Reform of China's Farmland Water Facilities Improved Farmers' Irrigation Efficiency?-Evidence from a Typical Reform Pilot in China's Yunnan Province
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - China is implementing a pilot project to reform the property rights of farmland water facilities to solve the serious problems of chaotic end-of-pipe governance and inefficient irrigation from farmers. Based on microscopic research data of farm households in a typical pilot in Lu Liang County, Yunnan Province, in China, this study uses the Tobit model, and SEM was used to explore the impact of property rights reform on the irrigation efficiency of farmers and the potential mechanism paths. We further analyzed the differences in governance logic and irrigation efficiency between the two property rights models of "multiple cooperative governance" and "private contract governance" formed after the reform. The findings are as follows: (1) Compared with nonreformed areas, reformed areas have a higher promotion of adoption of water-saving technologies and a better quality of facility maintenance, which significantly contributes to irrigation efficiency, but farmers' perception of water scarcity negatively affects irrigation efficiency; (2) there are differences between the "multiple cooperative governance model" and "private contract governance model" in terms of the mechanism paths to improve irrigation efficiency, resulting in different focuses between the two models, in which the former one has better irrigation efficiency while cutting off some of the farmers' benefits and the latter benefits more farmers while losing some of the irrigation efficiency. Finally, this study recommends that China should continue to promote the reform of farmland water property rights while focusing on promoting water conservation technologies, improving the quality of facility maintenance and facility water supply capacity, enhancing farmers' awareness of water scarcity, and implementing a more water-efficient "multiple cooperative governance model". The results of this study provide a model with Chinese characteristics for developing property rights policies and governance models for farmland water facilities in developing countries.

TI  - Uganda Warehousing Receipt System: Improving Market Performance and Productivity
T2  - AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
AB  - Warehouse receipt systems (WRS) allow farmers and traders to access markets and financial systems. While this system is not new in Uganda, as seen by both public and private effort since 2004 during its pilot, very little is known why it failed to ensure market access and credit. With the Uganda Warehouse Receipt System Authority in place, the government of Uganda seeks to reinstate the public warehouse receipt system with a focus on the electronic WRS (E-WRS). This study therefore seeks to document perceived benefits and challenges of private sector stakeholders of the WRS in Uganda. This paper relies on qualitative data and follows the Structure-Conduct-Performance framework used to analyse agricultural commodity markets. The results reveal that while the market structure and conduct of the pilot WRS was implemented as theorized, it faced various barriers that led to poor market performance. Despite the challenges, actors are optimistic that reinstating the WRS will lead to better access to markets and credit. The paper draws important policy implications for the implementation of the WRS including the need for government to spearhead promotion of standards; improvements in smallholder productivity; capacity strengthening of collective action; and the importance of increased sensitization on all aspects of the WRS.

TI  - Toward a feminist political ecology of household food and water security during drought in northern Nicaragua
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Few studies assess the relationship between food and water access, despite global concerns about people's inability to maintain access to both food and water. We conducted a mixed-methods comparative case study in northern Nicaragua, with smallholders from two neighboring communities that differed in water availability and institutional strength, using a feminist political ecology framework and food and water security definitions that focus on access, availability, use, and stability. We adopted a participatory approach that included: a sex-disaggregated survey in 2016; interviews, participant observation, and community-based water quality testing from 2014 to 2019; and analysis of a severe drought that occurred from 2014 to 2017. Our results suggest that uneven power relations, biophysical conditions, gender, and institutions shape food and water access, and indicate that households across both communities average 2 months of drinking water insecurity during the dry season followed by an average of 2.5 months of food insecurity early in the growing season. The average duration of lean food months was similar across communities and sex, but water insecurity lasted longer in the community that had weaker local institutions and less surface water availability. Ethnographic research helped to document uneven and gendered experiences of water access and to illustrate how they were also shaped by conflicts over water for irrigation vs. domestic uses and cross-scalar limitations in water and land governance. Although we found that gender and institutions were not strong predictors of several food and water insecurity indicators on their own, both factors influenced the terms of access, conflict, and cooperative governance needed to secure resources and well-being. Our study highlights the need for theory, methods, and field research that integrate the analysis of food and water security, and it contributes to developing a feminist political ecology approach that unifies this analysis with a focus on gender.

TI  - Relationships between work organisation and size of dairy farms: a case study based in Vietnam
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - In Vietnam, livestock farming policy is designed to develop milk production to increase the country's dairy self-sufficiency. However, workload is one of the main constraints limiting the potential for increasing production and herd sizes on family-run farms. The aim of this paper was to explore the relationships connecting work organisation forms and durations to herd sizes in order to understand the impacts of rationalising work by increasing herd numbers. A work organisation survey was carried on 19 dairy farmers in two regions of northern Vietnam. Statistical analysis was run to identify relationships between herd size, work organisation forms and work durations. A cluster analysis was used to establish a typology. The results show that the volume of routine work is higher in large herds but is also more efficient. Farmers running large herds lighten their family workload by mechanising routine tasks and by employing permanent contract workers. The paper concludes on a set of guidance strategies to help dairy farms develop their activity, such as hiring farm labour and mechanising farm tasks.

TI  - The Economic Geography of Kenyan Tobacco Farmers' Livelihood Decisions
T2  - NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH
AB  - Introduction: The narrative of prosperous economic livelihood of tobacco farmers in Kenya as alleged by the tobacco industry deserves challenge as evidence increasingly suggests that smallholder tobacco farmers are making little or no profits. Article 17 of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control encourages viable alternative livelihoods for tobacco farmers. There is little evidence, however, on how tobacco farmers make livelihood choice decisions.
   Methods: A total of 527 purposefully selected smallholder tobacco farmers in Kenya from three main tobacco-growing regions participated in a 2017 economic livelihood survey. Geo-economic data were matched to surveyed farmers' Global Positioning System coordinates to estimate each farmer's access to nearby economic centers. Ownership of cell phones or radios was also used to estimate farmers' virtual access to nearby economic activities to understand better the role of information. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to control socioeconomic status and self-reported activity in nearby economic centers.
   Results: Tobacco farmers rarely live within 10 km of an economic center. Results suggest that the further away farmers live from economic centers, the less likely they are to grow tobacco, but more likely to grow tobacco under contract. Also, farmers owning a cell phone or radio are not only less likely to grow tobacco, but also to not engage in farming under contract if they do grow tobacco.
   Conclusions: Physical and virtual access to nearby economic activities is significantly associated with tobacco farmers' livelihood choice decision and should be taken into consideration by decision makers while developing interventions for FCTC Article 17.
   Implications: Smallholder tobacco farmers in lower-income countries are making little or no profits, but few studies have been conducted to illuminate what perpetuates tobacco production, with such studies urgently needed to support governments to develop viable alternative livelihoods for tobacco farmers. This study suggests that geographic and technological factors that shape farmers' economic decisions can help policy makers tailor alternative livelihood policies to different regional contexts and should be a focus of future research in this area.

TI  - Epidemiological characteristics of pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with pneumoconiosis based on its social determinants and risk factors in China: a cross-sectional study from 27 provinces
T2  - CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Background:Patients with pneumoconiosis have an elevated risk of contracting pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and need particular attention. However, extensive population-based studies on the prevalence of PTB in patients with pneumoconiosis have not been reported in China since 1992. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of PTB in patients with pneumoconiosis based on its social determinants and risk factors in China.Methods:Based on the Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) framework, data were obtained from a questionnaire survey of patients with pneumoconiosis from China's 27 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) from December 2017 to June 2021. By chi-square and multivariate logistic regression analyses, the epidemiological characteristics of PTB in the patients were identified based on its prevalence and odds ratio (OR) and associated social determinants and risk factors. The population attributable fractions (PAFs) of significant risk factors were also calculated.Results:The prevalence of PTB in patients with pneumoconiosis (n = 10,137) was 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.0-8.0%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that risk factors included in-hospital exposure to patients with PTB (OR = 3.30, 95% CI: 2.77-3.93), clinically diagnosed cases (OR = 3.25, 95% CI: 2.42-4.34), and northeastern regions (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.76-3.31). In addition, lack of work-related injury insurance (WRII), being born in a rural area, being unemployed, living in western regions, household exposure to patients with PTB, smoking, being underweight, complications of pulmonary bullae or pneumothorax, hospitalization history, and former drinkers among the rural patients were also statistically significant risk factors. Being born in a rural area, lack of WRII and in-hospital exposure to patients with PTB had higher PAFs, which were 13.2% (95% CI: 7.9-18.5%), 12.5% (95% CI: 8.3-16.7%), and 11.6% (95% CI: 8.8-14.3%), respectively.Conclusion:The prevalence of PTB in pneumoconiosis remains high in China; it is basically in line with the CSDH models and has its characteristics.

TI  - Assessment of technical, economic, and allocative efficiencies of shrimp farming in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY
AB  - This study applied a stochastic frontier production model to analyze the technical (TE), allocative (AE), and economic (EE) efficiencies of intensive shrimp farming households, and to identify socioeconomic and shrimp farm-specific factors (farm size, labor, feed, seed, chemicals/medicine) that influence the TE, AE, and EE of shrimp production in the Ca Mau, Ben Tre, Bac Lieu, and Tra Vinh provinces of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The AE was calculated based on TE and EE. The stochastic frontier production and cost function model were used to evaluate the EE and TE at the shrimp farming household level. The results showed that the mean TE, AE, and EE of shrimp farming systems were 75%, 68.5%, and 61.4%, respectively. Age, gender, education, experience, cooperatives, and technical training significantly impacted the efficiency of shrimp production. The results suggest that shrimp farmers can improve shrimp productivity and EE by decreasing feed cost (FEE) and medicine/chemical cost (MED) of farm inputs. The study showed that shrimp farmers who participated in training activities, cooperatives, or management boards of aquaculture associations were more technically efficient than other farmers. The findings of this study provide essential information about the TE, AE, and EE of shrimp production, which can help local policy makers and shrimp farmers in the region to make better decisions on how to improve the EE and sustainability of shrimp production in the future. There is a need for recommendations on how to improve policies, technical guidance, and training courses on feed management and feeding practices, water quality, and disease management, to help shrimp farmers in the coastal provinces of the Mekong Delta to improve their shrimp production efficiencies in the future.

TI  - Socio-demographic factors influencing knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) regarding malaria in Bangladesh
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: A clear understanding of the social and behavioral risk factors, and knowledge gaps, related to exposure to malaria are essential when developing guidelines and recommendations for more effective disease prevention in many malaria endemic areas of the world including Bangladesh and elsewhere in the South East Asia. To-date, the level of knowledge that human populations, residing in moderate to high malaria risk zones, have with respect to the basic pathogen transmission dynamics, risk factors for malaria or disease preventative strategies, has not been assessed in Bangladesh. The purpose of this study was to address this gap by conducting surveys of the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of people, from variable socio-demographic backgrounds, residing in selected rural malaria endemic areas in Bangladesh.
   Methods: The KAP survey was conducted in portions of six different malaria endemic districts in Bangladesh from July to October 2011. The survey consisted of interviewing residence of these malaria endemic districts using a structured questionnaire and interviewers also completed observational checklists at each household where people were interviewed. The study area was further divided into two zones (1 and 2) based on differences in the physical geography and level of malaria endemicity in the two zones. Data from the questionnaires and observational checklists were analysised using Statistical Package for Social Sciences 16.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
   Results: A total of 468 individuals from individual households were interviewed, and most respondents were female. Monthly incomes varied within and among the zones. It was found that 46.4% and 41% of respondents' family had malaria within the past one year in zones 1 and 2, respectively. Nearly 86% of the respondents did not know the exact cause of malaria or the role of Anopheles mosquitoes in the pathogen's transmission. Knowledge on malaria transmission and symptoms of the respondents of zones 1 and 2 were significantly (p<0.01) different. The majority of respondents from both zones believed that bed nets were the main protective measure against malaria, but a significant relationship was not found between the use of bed net and prevalence of malaria. A significant relationship (p<0.05) between level of education with malaria prevalence was found in zone 1. There was a positive correlation between the number of family members and the prevalence of malaria. Houses with walls had a strong positive association with malaria. Approximately 50% of the households of zones 1 and 2 maintained that they suffered from malaria within the last year. A significant association (p<0.01) between malaria and the possession of domestic animals in their houses was found in both zones. People who spent time outside in the evening were more likely to contract malaria than those who did not.
   Conclusion: To address the shortcomings in local knowledge about malaria, health personnel working in malaria endemic areas should be trained to give more appropriate counseling in an effort to change certain deeply entrenched traditional behaviors such as spending time outdoors in the evening, improper use of bed nets and irregular use of insecticides during sleep.

TI  - The effect of marketing messages and payment over time on willingness to pay for fuel-efficient cookstoves
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
CP  - 4th Symposium on Economic Experiments in Developing Countries (SEEDEC)
AB  - Smoke from inefficient biomass cookstoves contributes to global climate change and kills approximately four million people per year. Cooking technologies, such as manufactured fuel-efficient cookstoves, that mitigate the negative effects of traditional cookstoves exist, but adoption rates are low. The international development community debates whether this low adoption of fuel-efficient cookstoves is due to a lack of adequate product information or due to household financial constraints. We ran Vickery second-price auctions in rural Uganda to elicit willingness to pay for fuel-efficient cookstoves, comparing the effect of informational marketing messages and time payments on willingness to pay. A randomized trial tested the following marketing messages: "This stove can improve health," "This stove can save time and money," and both messages combined. None of the messages consistently increased willingness to pay. In a second experiment we compared willingness to pay for two different contracts, one with payment due within a week and one with equal installment payments over 4 weeks. Consistent with household financial constraints, time payments raised willingness to pay by 40%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - WHAT DETERMINES WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION IN COLLECTIVE ACTION? EVIDENCE FROM A WESTERN UGANDAN COFFEE COOPERATIVE
T2  - FEMINIST ECONOMICS
AB  - Women smallholders face greater constraints than men in accessing capital and commodity markets in Sub-Saharan Africa. Collective action has been promoted to remedy those disadvantages. Using survey data of 421 women members and 210 nonmembers of a coffee producer cooperative in Western Uganda, this study investigates the determinants of women's participation in cooperatives and women's intensity of participation. The results highlight the importance of access to and control over land for women to join the cooperative in the first place. Participation intensity is measured through women's participation in collective coffee marketing and share capital contributions. It is found that duration of membership, access to extension services, more equal intrahousehold power relations, and joint land ownership positively influence women's ability to commit to collective action. These findings demonstrate the embeddedness of collective action in gender relations and the positive value of women's active participation for agricultural-marketing cooperatives.

TI  - Determinants of smallholder farmers' membership in co-operative societies: evidence from rural Kenya
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose-Despite the potential for co-operatives to improve smallholder farmers' livelihoods, membership in the co-operatives is low. This study examines factors that influence smallholder farmers' decisions to join agricultural co-operatives.
   Design/methodology/approach- This study involved a survey of 1,274 smallholder chicken farmers. The data were analysed through a two-sample t-test of association, Pearson's Chi-square test and binary probit regression model.
   Findings-The results suggest that farming as the main source of income, owning a chicken house, education attainment, attending training or accessing information, vaccination of goats and keeping a larger herd of goats are the key factors which significantly influence co-operative membership. However, gender, age, household size, distance to the nearest agrovet, vaccinating chicken and the number of chickens kept do not influence co-operative membership.
   Research limitations/implications- The survey did not capture data on some variables which have been shown to influence co-operative membership. Nevertheless, the results show key explanatory variables which influence membership in co-operatives.
   Practical implications- These findings have implications for development agencies that seek to use co-operatives for agricultural development and improvement of smallholder farmers' livelihoods. The agencies can use the results to initiate interventions relevant for different types of smallholder farmers through co-operatives.
   Originality/value-This study highlights the influence of smallholder farmers' financial investments in farming and the extent of commercialisation on co-operative membership. Due to low membership in co-operatives, recognising the heterogeneity of smallholder farmers is the key in agricultural development interventions through co-operative membership.

TI  - Social roots of resource use routes in rural Maranhao, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - The examination of social and ecological trajectories in two smallholder communities that experienced land conflicts in the 1980s provides empirical evidences for the formulation of a grounded political ecology of peasant resource use in Brazil's Mid-North. The approach is used to progressively track factors triggering different decisions, livelihood strategies and contrasting social relations. Today's discrepancies in land-use trajectories and social life were traced back to attitudes and the agency of local residents as they confronted socio-structural and ecological opportunities and constraints in the past. The cases reflected the contrast between a background of hierarchical, subordinated relations, and a more egalitarian social structure. Cooperation and agreement or discord and individual orientation resulted from social dynamics that marked the communities since land occupation in the 1920s. Kinship networks featured in one case enhanced collective action and welfare, while the lack of institutions regulating resource-use in the other case failed to establish a sustainable system.

TI  - Self-help group participation towards sustainable solid waste management in peri-urban villages: evidence from Mumbai Metropolitan Region, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The growth of secondary and tertiary sectors in the peri-urban villages results in development strain and causes demographic, socio-economic, and spatial transformations. Deficiency in provisioning of basic services is one of the prime concerns for these villages. This study aims to examine the present conditions and the community's attitude towards waste management, and whether the self-help groups (SHGs) can aid in developing a sense of collective responsibility. Five villages from the Bhiwandi Surrounding Notified Area in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, India, were selected for a case study investigation of the current situation of service provisioning by the rural local bodies. Questionnaire surveys were conducted for 122 households and the heads of all SHGs in the villages simultaneously. Due to the limited household surveys, the data were triangulated with documents and interviews with officials. The results were qualitatively and quantitatively analysed to understand people's perception of the SHGs and the major factors through which the groups contribute in improving livelihoods and living conditions. The SHGs also play a significant role in developing awareness of issues and social integration in the rapidly evolving structure of these peri-urban communities, as is highlighted in the case studies. The relations between SHG participation and literacy levels on the attitude towards local involvement in solid waste management for the villages were analysed. The resulting significant correlations point towards the consideration of these factors while planning for a development model for peri-urban villages. Policy-level support to the SHGs can help in fostering local partnerships and community initiatives towards better service delivery in the villages. This kind of social empowerment forms the basis for social sustainability, which in turn promotes economic and environmental sustainability.

TI  - Prevalence of Tick-Borne Pathogens from Ticks Collected from Cattle and Wild Animals in Tanzania in 2012
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
AB  - This study was aimed to disclose the prevalence rate of tick-borne pathogens from ticks collected from cattle and wild animals in Tanzania in 2012. Ticks were collected from slaughtered cattle and dead wild animals from November 5 to December 23, 2012 and identified. PCR for detecting Anaplasmataceae, Piroplamidae, Rickettsiaceae, Borrelia spp., and Coxiella spp. were done. Among those tested, Rickettsiaceae, Piroplasmidae, and Anaplasmataceae, were detected in ticks from the 2 regions. Rickettsiaceae represented the major tick-borne pathogens of the 2 regions. Ticks from animals in Maswa were associated with a higher pathogen detection rate compared to that in ticks from Iringa. In addition, a higher pathogen detection rate was observed in ticks infesting cattle than in ticks infesting wild animals. All examined ticks of the genus Amblyomma were infected with diverse pathogens. Ticks of the genera Rhipicephalus and Hyalomma were infected with 1 or 2 pathogens. Collectively, this study provides important information regarding differences in pathogen status among various regions, hosts, and tick species in Tanzania. Results in this study will affect the programs to prevent tick-borne diseases (TBD) of humans and livestock in Tanzania.

TI  - Organic farming for local markets in Kenya: Contribution of conversion and certification to environmental benefits
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D AGROECONOMIE
AB  - Organic farming is a way to address environmental issues. In Kenya, organic production for domestic markets based on local certification represents a solution to both economic and environmental issues. We propose to address this latter issue. Indeed, no quantitative studies have been dedicated to these systems' impacts on the environment. However, their theoretical benefits can be weakened, first by their functioning based on internal control and indirect external control, and second by the risk of self-selection since farmers using low levels of synthetic inputs have less effort to make in order to enter in conversion process. Thanks to unique farm-level survey data along with the propensity score matching method, we assess the producer-level effects of organic certification for fruits and vegetables on agro-ecological practices. We show that conversion and certification are associated with organic farming techniques and positive perceptions of different statements about environmental values. However, we do not notice any additional effects of certification compared to conversion alone. Although economic issues are important, we focus on environmental issues that appear as important for smallholders. In a context with no public regulation, conversion-only farmers and locally certified farmers could be a lever for a more sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Changing Property-Rights Regimes: A Study of Rural Land Tenure in China
T2  - CHINA QUARTERLY
AB  - Through two rounds of land contracting, rural households have been allocated a bundle of rights in land. We observe significant differences across villages in the amount of land to which villagers retain a claim and the institutional mechanisms governing the exchange of land rights. This study reveals the perpetuation and expansion of non-market mechanisms accruing to the benefit of village cadres and state officials and only limited emergence of market mechanisms in which households are primary beneficiaries. It identifies factors in economic, political and legal domains that incentivize and enable state officials and local cadres to capture returns from use of land. Relatedly, the study finds differences in conflict over property-rights regimes. Drawing on a pilot survey carried out by the authors in November of 2011 in Shaanxi and Jiangsu provinces (192 households in 24 villages), this paper seeks to explain heterogeneity and change in property-rights regimes over time and across space.

TI  - Farmers' preferences for supermarket contracts in Kenya
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - With the modernization of global agri-food systems, the role of contract farming increases. This also involves smallholder farmers in developing countries. While previous studies have looked at economic impacts of contract schemes on smallholder farmers, little is known about farmers' preferences for contracting in general, and for specific contract design attributes in particular. Better understanding farmers' preferences and constraints is important to make smallholder contract schemes more viable and beneficial. This article builds on a choice experiment to analyze farmers' preferences and preference heterogeneity for contracts in Kenya. In the study region, supermarkets use contracts to source fresh vegetables directly from preferred suppliers. However, farmer dropout rates are high. Mixed logit models are estimated to examine farmers' attitudes towards critical contract design attributes. Having to deliver their harvest to urban supermarkets is costly; hence farmers require a significant output price premium. Farmers also dislike delayed payments that are commonplace in contract schemes. The most problematic contract attribute is related to unpredictable product rejection rates, substantially adding to farmers' risk. Designing contracts with lower transaction costs, more transparent quality grading, and fairer risk sharing arrangements could enhance smallholder participation in supermarket procurement channels.

TI  - Microfinance services for smallholder farmers: an assessment from rice farmers' expectations in Central Benin
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD ECONOMICS
AB  - This study analyzed the adequacy between credit supply and the expectations of rice farmers in Central Benin to define policies for improved agricultural-oriented financial services. A survey was conducted in October 2016 among 120 rice farmers randomly selected from six rice-farming villages. Data collected through structured and semi-structured interviews included the financial services offered by Microfinance Institutions, socio-demographic characteristics of rice farmers, their expectations and perception. Multivariate analysis combining hierarchical ascending cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to define the distinct groups of rice farmers according to their credit expectations. The unmet expectations of rice farmers for a credit scheme that suits their needs were identified based on the gaps between their expectations and perception. There were three rice farmers' clusters with distinct characteristics based on their expectations. These farmers were not satisfied with all the attributes of the current credit scheme. Pending the effectiveness of the agricultural bank, the approaches such as the inventory credit system are useful in facilitating credit access to smallholder farmers. It is also essential to combine credit supply with financial education and technical support in a system such as contract farming.

TI  - Why Don't Pesticide Applicators Protect Themselves? Exploring the Use of Personal Protective Equipment among Colombian Smallholders
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB  - The misuse of personal protective equipment (PPE) during pesticide application was investigated among smallholders in Colombia. The integrative agent-centered (IAC) framework and a logistic regression approach were adopted. The results Suggest that the descriptive social norm was significantly influencing PPE use. The following were also important: (1) having experienced pesticide-related health problems; (2) age; (3) the share of pesticide application carried Out; and (4) the perception of PPE hindering work. Interestingly, the influence of these factors differed for different pieces of PPE. Since conformity to the social norm is a source of rigidity in the system, behavioral change may take the form of a discontinuous transition. In Conclusion, five suggestions for triggering a transition towards more Sustainable PPE use are formulated: (1) diversifying targets/tools; (2) addressing structural aspects; (3) sustaining interventions in the long-term; (4) targeting farmers' learning-by-experience; and (5) targeting PPE use Oil a collective level.

TI  - How does relationship-based governance accommodate new entrants? Evidence from the cycle-rickshaw rental market
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Relationship-based contract enforcement is commonly thought to limit market expansion. In contrast, this paper illustrates how relationship-based contract governance accommodates new entrants into market exchange using a case study of the cycle-rickshaw rental market in a city in central India. Migrants face a higher penalty for default that introduces a gap between the ex ante risk for out-of-network agents and the ex post risk. As a result, cycle-rickshaw owners are more likely to rent to migrants and migrants are more likely to participate in rental contracts. With primary data on multidimensional measures of migrant status, we confirm that migrant status is a significant predictor of rental contract participation, even controlling for other variables that moderate the rickshaw driver's ability to own a cycle-rickshaw. Our findings thus introduce a new perspective into current understandings of relationship-based contract governance.

TI  - REACHING THE RURAL POOR THROUGH AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES IN MONGOLIA
T2  - ANNALS OF PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper focuses on the cooperative sector in central Mongolia. Its aim is to provide new insights into the role and importance of cooperatives among poor rural populations. We analyse cooperatives' inclusiveness of smaller herders and farmers and cooperatives' governance structures. The research is based on data collected in selected provinces of the central Tov region. The data were collected for three distinctive target groups - cooperative board members, cooperative members and non-members. We found that the cooperative sector in Mongolia is strongly affected by the governmental policy regarding wool subsidies, which provides subsidies only to cooperative members and has consequently caused rapid growth in the number of new, free-riding cooperative members and led to very low levels of members' self-identification with their cooperatives. This policy also affects the inner organizational structures of cooperatives. Further, we found indications that poorer farmers tend not to be members of cooperatives and that the overall benefits for non-members and the general community arising from local cooperatives are rather low.

TI  - Organic dried fig production: A comparative analysis of organic and conventional smallholdings in turkey
T2  - BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare productivity, profitability, producer-defined constraints, and goals and research priorities between ten individually paired organic and conventional fig farms in Turkey. Ten farm pairs, each of which consists of one organic and one conventional farm with less than 10 ha of fig plantation, were selected from five Fig Sales Cooperative (Taris-Incirbirlik) regions of Aydin Province with varying agro-ecological conditions. Although six of the organic farms matched or exceeded the production of their conventional counterparts, the three-year mean yield of the organic farms as a group was 5% lower than that of the conventional farms. However, excluding organic certification costs, mean variable costs and net income were similar for both groups, mainly because organic price premiums received by the farmers compensated for lower yields. If current organic certification costs paid by firms are included to farm budgets, the price premiums paid to organic producers would have to increase to 22% in order to equal the net incomes from conventional dried fig. Conventional farmers identified low and unstable prices as the main constraints for sustained production and stated further intensification of production as their main goal. Organic farmers focused on farm diversification and agronomic practices that permit organic farm management.

TI  - Resilient Small Peasants: Historical Continuity and Modern Transformation-Vitality and Autonomous Responsibility of Small Peasants in China
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES IN CHINA
AB  - The question of understanding and dealing with the small peasants (xiao nong) in the course of the transition from traditional agricultural society to modern industrial society is a significant theoretical and practical issue. Previous views emphasized the peasants' vulnerability and suggested that they would eventually be replaced by other business entities. Such proposals cannot explain the fact that it was traditional small peasants who created China's agrarian civilization and that the small farming household based on the household contract responsibility system is still the main force in China's agricultural modernization. Re-examining the historical position and vitality of the small peasants, we can see that despite being vulnerable, they are "fragile but unbreakable; weak but never slackening" in their interaction with the external environment under various pressures. Historically, this kind of resilience has been endogenous within the long-term autonomous responsibility mechanism of China's small peasants, expressed in their reciprocal responsibility as a community of a shared future; in their sharing of burdens as a living community; in their internalization of responsibility as a community of production; and in their joint responsibility as a political community. After 1949, rural reform created conditions for the modern transformation of the resilient small peasant. Organization, socialization and state involvement have further enhanced the modern small peasants' resilience and developmental capacity, fueling the organic integration of small peasants and modern agriculture and driving the vigor of agricultural modernization.

TI  - Push and pull factors of red pepper (capsicum) market supply: Evidence from south western Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH
AB  - The growth and development of the spices sector depend upon market-oriented production system and good marketing infrastructure. However, for smallholder farmers, it is difficult to supply theirs produces to markets because of different problems and barriers. Therefore, this study was aimed at analyzing the push and pulls factors of red pepper market supply in Southwest Ethiopia. The primary data were collected from 267 randomly selected sample households'. The Tobit model was used to determine the volume of red pepper supplied to the market. The results shows that the education level of household head, land allocated for red pepper production, access to credit, and lagged price of red pepper significantly affect the volume of red pepper supplied to the market. The major production constraints that hamper red pepper yield were red pepper disease, lack of fertilizer supply, lack of improved variety, lack of pesticide, harvesting before maturity, and poor post-harvest handling. The marketing constraints were lack of marketplace, low and unstable price of the product, and low quality of product, improper scale, lack of government support, and lack of transport. Therefore, Policies that give more emphasis on the provision of modern inputs, improving infrastructure, strengthening institutions of collective action, and improving the marketing extension system are recommended.

TI  - Policy schemes for the transition to sustainable agriculture-Farmer preferences and spatial heterogeneity in northern Thailand
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Thailand has become one of the biggest exporters of agricultural products and the majority of the poor households rely on agriculture as their main source of income. Recent droughts and flooding have affected the agricultural farms especially in the upland areas of northern Thailand. Incentive based policies can play an important role in conservation and protection of agroecosystems. Hence, this paper applies a Choice Experiment approach to elicit small scale farmers' preferences for a potential payment policy scheme. Latent class models were used to analyse the farmers' responses to investigate their preferences, heterogeneity in preferences and the willingness to accept compensations. The results reveal that farmers are willing to participate in the proposed payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme; however, overall the farmers show an aversion to drastic changes in their farming activities. The analysis suggests that majority of the farmers prefer schemes which require moderate reduction in chemical use and have shorter contract lengths. Furthermore, the study also provides cost comparisons of various policy combinations and variation in spatial patterns of the welfare estimates, which are useful for identifying the target areas for effective implementation of policy schemes.

TI  - Crop-livestock integration practices, knowledge, and attitudes among smallholder farmers: Hedging against climate change-induced shocks in semi-arid Zimbabwe
T2  - OPEN LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Domestic and international crops and livestock trade remain fragile among Zimbabwean smallholder farmers. Commercial crop-livestock integration in climate change vulnerable areas is low and sparsely documented. Practice, knowledge, and attitude indicators influencing participation of smallholder farmers in crop-livestock integrated platforms as a hedge against climate change-induced risks and uncertainties were assessed. A survey with 240 farmers in Insiza district, Matabeleland province, Zimbabwe was conducted. A modified knowledge, attitude, and perception framework was used to analyze data from six wards supported by World Vision through supplementary livelihood programs on crop-livestock integration. Conventional crop-livestock (63%), mixed crops-livestock (25%), and traditional grains-livestock (12%) options were dominant. There was a thin presence of stakeholders with a limited number of local buyers, contracting companies, and agro-dealers who participate on these platforms. Farmers have the knowledge, positive attitude, and motivated perceptions about the potential of traditional grains-livestock mechanisms to reduce climate change welfare compromising factors. Unbalanced policies, limited financing, and uncompetitive marketing channels limit the uptake of this option. Traditional grains-livestock alternatives should be supported in semi-arid environments to reduce food, income, and nutrition insecurity. Public-private partnerships should establish value addition systems to increase the market size of traditional grains-livestock products and enhance commercialization.

TI  - Safe milk and risky quinoa The lottery and precarity of farming in Peru
T2  - FOCAAL-JOURNAL OF GLOBAL AND HISTORICAL ANTHROPOLOGY
AB  - The neoliberal global food system has intensified the uncertainties associated with peasant farming and agrarian livelihoods around the world. This article examines processes of precarization among smallholder farmers in the Majes Irrigation Project in Peru. By discussing price volatility and uncertainty related to the "free market," I argue that the conditions of small-scale entrepreneurial farmers today can best be understood in terms of gambling and precarity. Aft er four decades of neoliberal deregulation, farmers in Majes describe agriculture as a "lottery" where one can win or lose everything. Despite prospects of growth and progress, most farmers rely on low-income dairy farming or contracted crops for agro-industrial corporations. The freedom to take risks in the open market entails uncertainty and oft en results in loss, and farmers must negotiate the ambiguous relation between autonomy and dependency.

TI  - Measuring the technical efficiency and determinants of efficiency of rice (Oryza sativa) farms in Marmara region, Turkey
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF CROP AND HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the technical and scale efficiency of sample rice (Oryza sativa) farms and subsequently identify determinants of technical inefficiency in the Balikesir and Edirne provinces of Turkey. An input oriented data envelopment analysis (DEA) was used to estimate technical efficiency scores. Additionally, Tobit regression was used to explain the variation in the efficiency scores related to farm-specific factors. The data used in this study were based on a direct interview survey of 70 randomly selected rice farm households in the 2007 production year. Study results revealed that overall the technical efficiency score of sample rice farms was 0.92 on average and ranged from 0.75 to 1.00. Sample rice farms could reduce their inputs by c. 8% and still produce the same level of rice output. Calculated efficiency scores were subsequently regressed on explanatory variables using a Tobit analysis, to help in identifying inefficiency related factors. In this study, five explanatory variables were identified as being related to efficiency. The Tobit regression estimates showed that factors such as number of plots, farmer's age, and off-farm income negatively influenced technical efficiency, whereas farm size and membership of a cooperative showed a positive relationship with efficiency.

TI  - Social Capital in Cooperative Memberships and Farmers' Access to Bank Credit-Evidence from Fujian, China
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - For rural communities in poor countries to develop, farmers need money to invest in their farms. However, with limited assets of their own and poor conditions for obtaining loans, the farmers' operations suffer. This study explores how farmers' chances of obtaining a bank loan are related to the social capital that they receive from their cooperative membership. The data originated from 743 farmers in Fujian province, China, and was analyzed with the help of the instrumental variable probit (IV-probit) regression model. The results show that (a) cooperative members have a higher chance of obtaining a bank loan compared to non-members; (b) cooperative membership positively influences the chances of obtaining a bank loan for farmers with no acquaintances in banks and government or off-farm work; and (c) among farmers with higher financial knowledge, cooperative members are more likely to receive a bank loan than non-members are. Therefore, the conclusion provides empirical evidence for the financial function of cooperatives to farmers. The findings are especially relevant for cooperatives in developing countries, and they call for farmers and cooperatives to establish cooperative financial institutions. Moreover, the research conclusions point out the direction for further improving the financial effect of cooperatives.

TI  - Private and state-led contract farming in Zimbabwe: Accumulation, social differentiation and rural politics
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE
AB  - Contract farming schemes often amplify existing patterns of socio-economic differentiation. In Zimbabwe, processes of differentiation were underway before the current expansion of contract farming and they have deepened through the Fast Track Land Reform process. This article examines how pre-existing dynamics of differentiation shape the forms of contract farming adopted, as well as which groups of farmers gain access and on what terms. Social differentiation partly explains the outcomes of contract farming, even if contract farming in turn results in further differentiation. This article contrasts private sector-led contract farming of tobacco and state-led financing of maize production (the 'command agriculture' programme) in two high-potential sites and across different forms of land use. Unlike in many other settings, contract farming in Zimbabwe is highly influenced by the state, through the regulation of private sector arrangements and the establishment of a state-led contracting programme. The state-led programme boosted maize production amongst medium-scale farmers and resulted in an embedding of patronage relations. Meanwhile, the private-led contract farming has supported a widespread boom of tobacco production, mainly amongst smallholders. We find therefore that contract farming is highly dependent on the contingent, politically mediated processes of social differentiation.

TI  - Risk-revealing contracts for government-sponsored microinsurance
T2  - PACIFIC-BASIN FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - Microinsurance products are designed primarily to address the needs of low-income individuals and households in the developing world. Given the small premium volumes and slight profit margins of microinsurance, insurers generally cannot sustain high underwriting costs. In the present work, we propose a practical method for a government monopoly to reduce problems of adverse selection in microinsurance through risk-revealing contracts. We then apply this methodology to China's Urban and Rural Residents' Basic Medical Insurance (URRBMI) system, a voluntary, microinsurance monopoly whose lack of underwriting procedures makes it vulnerable to adverse selection. Historical provincial-level data from the New Cooperative Medical Scheme, a predecessor of the URRBMI, are used to illustrate the proposed approach.

TI  - Drivers of rising residential house rent in Wolkite town, Gurage zone, Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - Increase in residential house rent prompts social, health and economic problem to society. The problem is more pronounced in developing countries where social welfare programs are not available. Thus, it is imperative to examine the derivers of rising residential house rent to design appropriate housing policies and strategies to curtail the increasing rental price of housing. Previous studies focused on housing amenities, location, house size, construction materials and cost of housing units as the drivers of residential house rent. However, there were scanty of empirical evidences that showed the association of rental price of housing with house brokers, land policy, inflation, rural to urban migration and household size. Therefore, the main objective of the study is to investigate the determinants of rising residential house rent in Wolkite town by integrating these additional variables. Data were collected from 204 renter units by using questionnaire and estimated using ordinary least square method. In addition, keyinformant interview was conducted for triangulation purpose. The study found that on average 27.877% of the monthly income of house renters was spent for residential house rent payment. Houses located at the centre of the town, built from cement or ceramics and with more bedrooms were contributed to the rising residential rent of housing. Increase in household size, being male and literate also increased the rent of housing. The participation of house rent broker has played a significant role in the increasing rent of housing. In addition, the interview result revealed that high rural to urban migration, inflation and absence of written contract between homeowners and renters have contributed to the increasing rent of housing. Therefore, government and city administration should regulate housing rent through introducing legal contract between homeowners and house renters. House brokers should be legalized and set a lump-sum service charge in steady of percentage commission. Rural-urban migration should be managed properly by focusing on balanced rural-urban development. It can also be managed by increasing housing supply through cooperative housing, private sector housing investment and government housing development program. Lastly, housing mortgage should be available along with the liberalization of land market.

TI  - Processor Linkages and Farm Household Productivity: Evidence from Dairy Hubs in East Africa
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - Linking smallholder farmers to large enterprises could be a powerful mechanism to improve input and output markets as well as other productivity-enhancing services for liquidity constrained smallholders. Dairy hubs promoted by East African Dairy Development project are collective farmer-owned milk bulking and/or chilling plants through which farmers get access to output markets and inputs as well as other services necessary for their dairy enterprises. The hubs act as a linkage between large processors and smallholder dairy farmers. They enable farmers to supply milk to large dairy processors who are emerging key players in the East African dairy industry. In addition to the different forms of linkages with large processors, these hubs also differ in their level of growth toward sustainability. In light of this background, this work aims to provide evidence on the effects, at farm level, of different types of linkages between smallholder dairy farmers and large processors through dairy hubs. The study uses cross-sectional survey data collected from 993 smallholder livestock keeping households living within the dairy hubs' catchment areas in Kenya and Uganda. Statistical tests on technical efficiency estimates from dairy farm enterprises were conducted in order to provide evidence of the effects of the types of processor linkages on the performance of the dairy farm enterprises. The results provide evidence of no strong influence at farm levels that can be attributed to different forms of linkages with processor that dairy hubs adopt. Moreover, though hub sustainability is directly linked to the producer organization's efficiency level, our results show that it does not sufficiently translate to more productive farmers. These findings call for concerted efforts by development agents in the dairy sector, policy makers, and even large processors to intervene in order to support improved farmperformance. As evident from the study, one direct policy tool at the disposal of these agents is extension messages. [EconLit citations D24; L25; Q12]. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - The Influence of Settlers' Community in Shaping the COlonial AGricultural Marketing Policies in Tanzania
T2  - AFRICAN ECONOMIC HISTORY
AB  - When the British colonial government took over Tanzania, colonial officials championed and encouraged the inhabitants in Kilimanjaro to grow coffee along with settlers. The authorities gave priority to the local smallholders, relegating settlers to a minor role within colonial agriculture and the coffee economy in particular. This generated a vigorous protest among the settlers against the government policy. The tension would bring a number of remarkable developments, including the establishment of the Kilimanjaro Native Planters Association (KNPA) and, later, the promulgation of legislation regulating coffee farming and marketing via cooperatives, such as the Co-operative Societies Ordinance No. 7 of 1932 and the Native Coffee Control Ordinance No 26 of 1937. This paper examines the interlocked dimensions and intricacies related to the coffee industry policies, and their impact on agricultural policies in Kilimanjaro region as well as across the country. In particular, the paper discusses how the settlers' opposition influenced the promulgation of segregative, monopolistic and protectionist legislations, and the role of control Boards in this process. To do so, this paper relies on existing literature as well as underutilized primary sources obtained from the Tanzania National Archives (TNA) in Dar Es Salaam.

TI  - Effects of land transfer quality on the application of organic fertilizer by large-scale farmers in China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The application of organic fertilizer is conducive to improving the quality of cultivated land. Previous studies suggest that the small scale of operation is the key factor restricting the application of organic fertilizer in China. However, the application of organic fertilizer has not increased alongside the increase in the scale of agricultural land management in China which is associated with an increasingly active land transfer market (i.e. farmers renting their farmland to and from other farmers). It is therefore necessary to determine the key factors restricting the application of organic fertilizer by large-scale farmers in China. A survey was conducted of large-scale grain-growing households (with managed lands of at least 3.33 ha) from Anhui Province in the east of China. The study aimed to test the effect of land transfer quality on the application of organic fertilizer by large-scale farmers. The 'quality of transferred lands' incorporates the level of fragmentation of transferred lands and the stability of transferred land management rights. Probit and Tobit models were used as a benchmark, the IV-Probit model and IV-Tobit model were used to eliminate the endogeneity, and the Heckman two-stage model was used for further empirical tests. The results show that the ratio of the crop planting area where organic fertilizer was applied to the total crop planting area was only 22 %, indicating that large-scale farmers are not commonly applying organic fertilizer. The average area of transferred plots of land and the land lease term have significant positive effects on the probability and intensity of large-scale grain-growing households applying organic fertilizer. The number of transferred plots of land and land transfer contracts being broken during the lease term have significant negative effects on the probability and intensity of large-scale grain-growing households applying organic fertilizer. It can be concluded that the key to encouraging large-scale farmers to apply organic fertilizer is to increase the quality of land transfers, including a realization of contiguous land transfers and improving the stability of transferred land management rights.

TI  - ORGANIZATIONAL REFORMATION OF AGRIBUSINESS ENTITIES IN UKRAINE
T2  - BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - The article considers urgent issues of organizational reformation of economic entities of the AIC with a view to their optimization to requirements of an advanced development model of the agrarian economy. The importance of mentioned topics is determined by the content and themes of conducted system transformations in the agricultural sector of the agrarian economy towards the formation of a competitive and economically attractive system of management. Research object is subjects of various organizational forms of management in the agrarian sector of the economy in the process of their structural reforming. The purpose of the research is to substantiate development processes of AIC enterprises in a transition economy through the organizational modelling of production organization forms in terms of formation of an advanced model of a reproduction of the agrarian economy. The methodology of the research in this article is formed on the compliance with the economic development demands through the relevant laws. Their requirement is realized through the compliance with the requirements of scientific principles as guiding ideas for the implementation of business practices. The interrelation of management functions and scientific principles allows determining a set of research methods for the stated issue. It should be stressed that scientific methodology of this research also includes the use of factors of placement of agrarian enterprises in space and a set of factors of the external and internal influence that make a direct impact on the efficiency of functioning, in particular, small business forms. As a research result, the paper highlights a bipolar structure of the agrarian sector where powerful agrarian-industrial formations and small agricultural enterprises and households of the population coexist in parallel. It quite clearly distinguishes creation of cooperatives, which are considered a basis and effective form of business in rural areas that ensures rural development. In the authors' opinion, among the presented business forms in rural areas, which operate in parallel, family farming enterprises can become the most perspective in the future. Today, agricultural enterprises, which, on the basis of mergers or acquisitions, were included in the composition of agricultural holdings, generally do not know their status, and hence they actually lose their economic independence. The practical importance of this publication is the possibility of allocating economically feasible forms of organizational development of the AIC and, on this basis, development and introduction of effective mechanisms for managing their support from the hierarchical authorities.

TI  - Stakeholders' Preferences towards Contract Attributes: Evidence from Rice Production in Vietnam
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Contract farming is typically considered an appropriate measure for small-scale farmers to solve their constraints and problems. However, despite positive effects, low participation in and high dropout rates from contract farming schemes remain challenges. Therefore, this study objects to evaluate preferences for contract attributes and attribute levels among contracting buyers, farmers, and government officials through data triangulation from key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and participant observations. Based on Henry Garrett Ranking, Rank Based Quotient, and Rank Based Sum methods, results indicate that the most important attributes were price options, payment, delivery arrangement, input provision, input-use requirements, and product quality standards. Despite a consensus on the ranking of the contract attributes, the preferences for the attribute levels among the stakeholders were heterogeneous. It is recommended that attributes and their levels should be pertinent in contract agreements. Thus, contract design with an adjusted or premium price, 50% of estimated payment before harvesting and the rest after delivery three to five days or lump-sum immediate payment, delivery after harvesting, inputs provision by the contractors through the representative branches or stores located at the local areas or cooperatives, banning active-ingredients or flexible use of inputs from the contractors to produce Good Agricultural Practices or organic products are considerable options.

TI  - Perceived Risk and Willingness to Provide Loan to Smallholder Farmers in Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN BUSINESS
AB  - In this article, we investigate whether lending institutions perceive smallholder (individual) farmers as riskier borrowers than farm cooperatives. Our research results show that individual farmers in Ghana are less likely to be successful in obtaining credit than cooperative farmers, because they are perceived to be riskier borrowers. In addition, results show that the willingness of lending institutions to provide loans is higher for those farmers who are associated with cooperative societies. This suggests that individual farmers can increase their odds of securing loans by joining a cooperative society. Empirical results also support the hypothesis that the interest rate is a significant predictor of the willingness to loan bias among lending institutions. In addition, our results indicate that higher interest rates are associated with increased loan risk. However, when interest rate is higher, longer loan maturity can dampen the effect of interest rate. In other words, an increase in loan maturity length reduces the effect of interest rate on the loan risk. These research results have important policy implications for the welfare of smallholder farmers in developing economies as lack of financing has a significant impact on smallholder farmer productivity.

TI  - Resource use, cattle performance and output patterns on different farm types in a mountainous province of northern Vietnam
T2  - ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB  - This study compares the use of resources, cattle performance and outputs on three different cattle-keeping farm types (mixed small farms, mixed medium farms with a collective use of natural pastures, and specialised large farms). The purpose was to evaluate the potential for beef production on household farms, where cattle keeping is integrated with cropping, compared with specialised large beef cattle farms. Data were collected by using farmer interviews, participatory rural appraisal tools and cattle body measurements, and analysed by linear models using SAS software.
   Household farms raised cattle at very low input levels. Medium farms had lower costs for cattle keeping than small farms in the lowlands (0.11 Vietnamese Dong x 10(6)/farm. year compared with 1.20 Vietnamese Dong x 10(6)/farm. year). High inputs were observed on all large farms. Only the local Yellow cattle was found in the highlands. Yellow cattle was less fertile in the highlands than in the lowlands (age at first calving of 3.2 years and calving interval of 16.3 months compared with 2.8 years and 12.6 months, respectively). Performances of exotic breeds varied according to feeding and breeding management of large farms. Crossbred Laisind cattle had a better productive adaptability than exotic beef breeds. Cattle were used mainly for working and manure by small farms. The stock value was highest on medium farms. Low outputs on large farms were a result of high feed costs, inappropriate management and the failure of markets. Results from simulations identify the medium mixed farms with access to natural pasture showing a potential for the development of beef production, provided that access to markets and cattle management is improved.

TI  - Anti-drought measures and their effectiveness: A study of farmers' actions and government support in China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - In China, the principal actors that are involved in combating drought in agricultural production are farmer households and the government. Prevailing research rarely focuses on both actors. At the same time, the effectiveness of anti-drought measures has been largely evaluated through farmers' anti-drought initiatives. But it is unclear from this literature if such initiatives result in better economic livelihoods. This paper will examine: (i) indicators of government and farmer activities that impact the latter's anti-drought actions, and (ii) the effect of anti-drought actions on farmers' agricultural income. Based on over 1000 household surveys conducted at major grain production areas in the North China Plain, two findings emerge. First, farmers' participation in local village organizations, government financial assistance, local government institutional support, and disaster warnings through multiple media channels positively influence farmers' anti-drought actions. Second, the combined efforts of both farmers and government in mitigating drought as well as labor, factors of production and social capital (local cooperative membership, phone contacts) are significant determinants of agricultural income. This study contributes to the ecological indicators literature by assessing the effectiveness of anti-drought metrics.

TI  - Private food safety and quality standards for fresh produce exporters: The case of Hortico Agrisystems, Zimbabwe
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - There is evidence that the challenges of complying with stricter food safety and quality standards are acting to exclude small-scale producers from export supply chains for high-value agricultural products. The case of Hortico Agrisystems illustrates the considerable challenges and costs faced by supermarket suppliers in sourcing from a broad base of small-scale producers in the context of evolving food safety and quality standards. While small-scale producers are able to achieve levels of compliance at least equal to those of large-scale producers, multi-tiered and dynamic systems of control are required to maintain control. These need to include measures that facilitate compliance, incentives to reward good performance and penalties to punish non-compliance. In establishing a sustainable supply system in this context, both exporters and small-scale producers face a steep learning curve in adjusting to new requirements, further emphasising the need for supply chains to be responsive to change.

TI  - Are free anti-tuberculosis drugs enough? An empirical study from three cities in China
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB  - Background: Tuberculosis (TB) patients in China still face a number of barriers in seeking diagnosis and treatment. There is evidence that the economic burden on TB patients and their households discourages treatment compliance.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in three cities of China. Patients were selected using probability proportional to size (PPS) cluster sampling of rural townships or urban streets, followed by list sampling from a patient register. Data were collected using a questionnaire survey, key informant interviews and focus group discussions with TB patients to gain an understanding of the economic burden of TB and implications of this burden for treatment compliance.
   Results: A total of 797 TB patients were surveyed, of which 60 were interviewed in-depth following the survey. More than half had catastrophic health expenditure. TB patients with higher household incomes were less likely to report non-compliance (OR 0.355, 95 % CI 0.140-0.830) and patients who felt that the economic burden relating to TB treatment was high more likely to report non-compliance (OR 3.650, 95 % CI 1.278-12.346). Those who had high costs for transportation, lodging and food were also more likely to report non-compliance (OR 4.150, 95 % CI 1.804-21.999). The findings from the qualitative studies supported those from the survey.
   Conclusion: The economic burden associated with seeking diagnosis and treatment remains a barrier for TB patients in China. Reducing the cost of treatment and giving patients subsidies for transportation, lodging and food is likely to improve treatment compliance. Improving doctors' salary system to cut off the revenue-oriented incentive, and expanding current insurance's coverage can be helpful to reduce patients' actual burden or anticipated burden. Future research on this issue is needed.

TI  - Factors influencing drop-out of households from community based health insurance membership in rural districts of Gurage Zone, Southern Ethiopia: Community based case-control study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundFinancial risk-sharing through community-based health insurance is a critical component of universal health coverage. However, its development is a great challenge, not only due to low enrollment but also due to the high dropout rate of members from the program, which threatens its sustainability. So far, the few existing studies in this area have focused on household enrollment into community-based health insurance, rather than on the number of members dropping out. This study aims to identify factors influencing households to drop out of community-based health insurance membership in rural districts of the Gurage Zone, Southern Ethiopia. MethodsA community-based case-control study was carried out from May to July 2021. Supplemented by qualitative focus group discussions. Multi-stage sampling was employed. An interviewer-administered prearranged tool was used for collecting data. Epi-data version 3.1 and SPSS version 21 were used for data entry and analysis. The association between factor and outcome variable was determined using binary logistic regression analysis at p < 0.05 and 95% CI. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically and triangulated. ResultsFrom 525 (175 cases and 350 controls) rural household heads 171 cases and 342 controls responded, yielding a response rate of 97.7%. Of those, 73.1 and 69.0% were males in cases and controls, respectively. The statistically significant influencing factors associated with dropout from community-based health insurance were: highest wealth status (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.14-4.87), unfavorable attitude toward CBHI (AOR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.87-3.37), no illness experienced in the last 3 months (AOR: 5.21, 95% CI: 2.90-9.33). no frequent health facility visits (AOR:5.03, 95% CI:1.17-23.43), no exposure to indigenous community insurance (AOR:0.10, 95% CI: 0.03-0.37), not graduated in the model household (AOR: 3.20, 95% CI:1.75-5.83), being a member in the program for more than 3 years (AOR:0.55, 95% CI: 0.29-0.94), not trusting governing bodies (AOR:10.52, 95% CI:4.70-23.53), the ordered drug was not available in the contractual facility (AOR:14.62, 95% CI:5.37-39.83), waiting time was >3 h (AOR:4.26, 95% CI:1.70-10.66), and poor perception of service quality (AOR:12.38, 95%CI:2.46-62.24). ConclusionThe findings of this study illustrated various factors which positively and negatively influenced households to drop out from CBHI: wealth status, attitude toward CBHI, perceived poor provider attitude toward CBHI members, illness experience in the household, the experience of frequent health facility visits, model household graduation status, trust on CBHI committee (governing bodies), availability of a prescribed drug in the contractual health facility, waiting time and perceived quality of health service from the contractual facility, exposure to any of the indigenous insurance (IDIR and/or IQUB) and length of membership in program. We strongly recommend all responsible stakeholders give strong attention to promoting the community, and for providers to project a favorable attitude toward community-based health insurance, to achieve model household graduation, and improve quality of service by addressing the basic quality-related areas like waiting time, and drug availability).

TI  - Member commitment in agricultural cooperatives: Evidence from Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Member commitment is essential for the efficiency and survival of member-based economic organizations like agricultural cooperatives. In Ethiopia, cooperatives are considered as important vehicles for linking smallholder farmers to markets and for rural development more generally. However, member commitment in cooperatives is not self-evident. Different scholars confirm that there is a decline in commitment of members to their cooperative. Consequently, it is important to identify what factors drive this decline to enhance member commitment and promote the performance of cooperatives. Thus, this paper seeks to explore the determinants of member commitment. Our empirical analysis is based on a 2014 survey among 240 members of agricultural cooperatives in Ethiopia. This paper makes two contributions to the academic body of knowledge on member commitment in agricultural cooperatives. First, it distinguishes between three elements of commitment: loyalty, identification and participation. By exploring the determinants of each element of commitment, we obtain a much richer picture of what drives members. Second, we make a distinction between multipurpose cooperatives and specialized marketing cooperatives. The study has important implications for policy makers, government and stakeholders of cooperatives for devising appropriate interventions that could enhance the commitment of members in agricultural cooperatives.

TI  - Whether New Cooperative Medical Schemes Reduce the Economic Burden of Chronic Disease in Rural China
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background: The New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) provides health insurance coverage for rural populations in China. This study aimed to evaluate changes in household catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) due to chronic disease before and after the reimbursement policies for services of chronic disease were implemented to provide additional financial support.
   Methods: The study used data from the household surveys conducted in Shandong Province and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in 2006 and 2008. The study sample in village-level units was divided into two groups: 36 villages which implemented the NCMS reimbursement policies for chronic diseases as the intervention group, and 72 villages which did not as the control group. Health care expenditure of more than 40% of household's non-food expenditure was defined as a household with CHE (i.e., impoverishment). The conceptual framework was established based on the Andersen socio-behavioral model of health care utilization to explore how the NCMS reimbursement policies impacted health expenditures. A difference-in-difference model was employed to compare the change in the proportion of households incurring CHE due to chronic disease between the two groups over time.
   Results: The households that participated in the NCMS were less likely to become impoverished (P<0.05). In addition, the households with both male household head and higher income level were protective factors to prevent CHE (P<0.05). Young households with preschool children suffered less from CHE (P<0.05). The effect of the NCMS reimbursement policies for chronic disease on the CHE was negative, yet not statistically significant (p = 0.814).
   Conclusions: The NCMS coverage showed financial protection for households with chronic disease. However, the NCMS reimbursement policies should be strengthened in the future.

TI  - Is Chinese National Health Insurance Effective in the Face of Severe Illness? A Perspective from Health Service Utilization and Economic Burden
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - Over the past decade, health insurance coverage has expanded dramatically in China. Health insurance benefits, however, remain shallow or ambiguous. This study examines the effect of Chinese national health insurance policy on health service utilization and economic burden in urban settings using the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance Household Survey. We employ the Heckman selection model to correct for selection bias among hospital inpatients, and find that compared to individuals without health insurance, those with health insurance are more likely to be admitted to the hospital when their physicians recommended them to enter the hospital as inpatients. Health insurance is also associated with about 45.6 % decrease in out-of-pocket inpatient expenditures. Individuals with urban employee basic medical insurance see the largest decrease in economic burden, followed by individuals with urban resident basic medical Insurance, and those with new rural cooperative medical insurance.

TI  - The role of agricultural cooperatives in serving as a marketing channel: evidence from low-income regions of Sichuan province in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Although cooperative organizations aim to enhance agricultural production and marketing, in some countries such as China, not all members sell their products through agricultural cooperatives. This study examines the determinants of using agricultural cooperatives as a marketing channel and its effects on farm income and household income, using survey data collected from cooperative members in low-income regions of Sichuan province in China. We employ both propensity score matching model and inverse probability weighting estimator with regression adjustment to address the sample selection bias issue. The empirical results show that risk attitude, farm size, machine ownership, sales ability, and demonstration level of cooperatives are main factors that determine the member's decision to use agricultural cooperatives as a marketing channel, and the marketing channel users obtain significantly higher farm income and household income than non-users. Our findings highlight the importance and necessity of promoting agricultural cooperatives as a marketing channel among non-users.

TI  - Financial Performance of Contract Tree Farming for Smallholders: The Case of Contract Eucalypt Tree Farming in Thailand
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - Eucalypt (Eucalyptus spp.) tree farming is a source of income for many smallholders in developing and emerging countries and critical to the resource supply of many pulp and paper companies. These companies rely on smallholders adopting tree farming, sometimes by offering a contract. This paper reports a study from four regions of Thailand, where smallholder eucalypt tree farming is practiced, which investigated the financial performance of contract eucalypt tree farming for smallholders. A total of 82 contract eucalypt tree farmers and 81 independent tree farmers were systematically selected and surveyed in these regions, using door-to-door personal interviews. Focus groups and key informant interviews were also used to gain in-depth understanding of the issues. An investment appraisal analysis was used to determine and evaluate comparative financial returns from various cutting cycle periods, through computation of the net present value (NPV). There was no evidence that contracts increase the NPV of tree growing. It could be that tree growers entered into a contractual agreement with the expectation of higher benefits and the importance of this expectation diminishes as the crop matures, and tree farmers appreciate the strong market for eucalypt wood in Thailand. Contracts do not increase inequalities in terms of income but they might increase inequalities in terms of knowledge, because farmers with more land have better access to new knowledge provided by the contracting company.

TI  - Sustaining linkages to high value markets through collective action in Uganda
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Uganda's rapid urbanization offers new market opportunities for smallholder farmers to supply higher Value markets such as supermarket chains and fast-food restaurants. Supplying these formal outlets offers higher incomes but accessing and maintaining links to these markets requires significant upgrading in terms of product quality and business management. To meet these conditions farmers need to become more organized which requires increased levels of social capital, to strengthen internal and external relations with group members, service providers and market chain actors. One farmers' group in south-western Uganda has successfully sustained sales of potatoes to a fast-food outlet in Kampala. Farmers had to learn a series of new skills and integrate multiple technical, organizational, financial and marketing innovations. This paper outlines how collective action combined with strong leadership and an iterative market-led learning process enabled a smallholder farmers' association to meet the considerable challenges of achieving the stringent quality parameters of a modern food outlet.

TI  - Towards Cleaner Production: Certified Seed Adoption and Its Effect on Technical Efficiency
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The implementation of new agricultural technologies has become a driving force for cleaner production on smallholder farms. Particularly, identifying technologies could enhance the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production, both of which are serious challenges. In this context, evaluating the adoption of certified seed and its impact on efficiency gains and waste reduction is highly fundamental for sustainable smallholder food production. This perspective was not always considered in previous studies. We address this research gap using cross-sectional data from wheat farmers in northern Kazakhstan. A multi-stage sampling procedure is employed while the sample-selection stochastic production frontier (SPF) is applied for a robust estimation. Results reveal that increased crop income, access to credit and education positively influence the adoption of certified seed while membership in cooperatives and distance from the market are negative determinants. We also find that adopters are 10.3% "cleaner in production" than non-adopters. A comparison was made between the conventional SPF and the sample-selection SPF to evaluate the credibility of the estimation. It was found that the estimates from the conventional SPF were biased by 10%. This study provides insights into two policy and scholarly questions, namely, how effective the adoption of certified seeds is in promoting cleaner production among wheat farmers and how it can be promoted among wheat farmers. Therefore, our study presents substantial empirical evidence to encourage investment in or to promote certified seed adoption in wheat production.

TI  - Efficiency and equity in groundwater markets: the case of Madhya Pradesh, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper examines efficiency and equity in groundwater markets with special attention to output sharing contracts and to the bargaining relationships between sellers and buyers, using household level data from Madhya Pradesh, India. Regression results find no significant inefficiency on farms managed by output sharing buyers, presumably because optimal input intensities are achieved through effective monitoring and contract adherence mechanisms embedded in long-term and intensive personal relationships between sellers and buyers. As for equity, the finding is that, while output sharing buyers pay higher water prices, the rate of premiums is merely 5 percentage points higher than the informal interest rate that they would have had to carry under other types of groundwater contracts. The results also show that buyers who have access to alternative water sellers pay lower water prices. These findings indicate that if the imperfection of credit and contingent markets in rural areas are taken into account, informal groundwater markets work fairly well in agrarian communities if monitoring and contract adherence mechanisms are embedded and a sufficient number of potential sellers are available.

TI  - Explaining the "Certification Gap" for Different Types of Oil Palm Smallholders in Riau Province, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Indonesia is the world's largest producer of palm oil, and its smallholder oil palm plantations involve more than 2.3 million farmers. The rapid expansion of the oil palm area, and resulting negative environmental and social impacts, has increased the demand for sustainability certification for palm oil products. This study investigates whether different types of smallholders face different barriers in complying with certification standards. The study uses survey data from 829 smallholders in Riau, Sumatra. First, an assessment is made of the gap between current management practices and practices required by Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil standards for different types of smallholders. Second, the article explores explanations for the gap between current and required practices. Finally, an investigation is made of the different starting points of different types of smallholders. Results indicate that the diversity between smallholders affects their prospects for certification. To date, this diversity in smallholders has not been taken into account in the application of Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil standards. This can help to explain the limited success of smallholder certifications in Indonesia.

TI  - Do cooperatives participation and technology adoption improve farmers' welfare in China? A joint analysis accounting for selection bias
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB  - This study examines the impact of farmers' cooperatives participation and technology adoption on their economic welfare in China. A double selectivity model (DSM) is applied to correct for sample selection bias stemming from both observed and unobserved factors, and a propensity score matching (PSM) method is applied to calculate the agricultural income difference with counter factual analysis using survey data from 396 farmers in 15 provinces in China. The findings indicate that farmers who join farmer cooperatives and adopt agricultural technology can increase agricultural income by 2.77 and 2.35%, respectively, compared with those non-participants and non-adopters. Interestingly, the effect on agricultural income is found to be more significant for the low-income farmers than the high-income ones, with income increasing 5.45 and 4.51% when participating in farmer cooperatives and adopting agricultural technology, respectively. Our findings highlight the positive role of farmer cooperatives and agricultural technology in promoting farmers' economic welfare. Based on the findings, government policy implications are also discussed.

TI  - Relative Preferences for Soil Conservation Incentives among Smallholder Farmers: Evidence from Malawi
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper uses framed choice experiments to examine the preferences of smallholder farmers in Malawi regarding alternative policy-based incentives to adopt conservation practices that reduce soil erosion and increase yields. The policy incentives offered in the choice experiments included an ideal index-based crop insurance contract, an index insurance contract with basis risk, cash payments, and fertilizer subsidies. Prior to implementing the choice experiments, the farmers participated in a workshop utilizing small group-based dynamic learning games that demonstrated how index-based crop insurance contracts function. The choice experiment results indicate that most farmers preferred cash payments to index insurance contracts, even when the insurance contracts offered substantially higher expected returns. Further, more risk averse farmers were more likely to prefer cash payments than less risk averse and risk loving farmers.

TI  - Fragmentation Reduction through Farmer-Led Land Transfer and Consolidation? Experiences of Rice Farmers in Wuhan Metropolitan Area, China
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Land fragmentation has become a serious obstacle to agricultural production, and land transfer and consolidation are traditionally emphasized as the two most effective solutions to this quandary. To identify the extent of land fragmentation accurately and systematically, this study selected the number of plots, the average size of plots, and the average distance between plots to calculate the land fragmentation index (LFI). Taking the Wuhan metropolitan area as a case study, this study examined the effectiveness of farmer-led land transfer and consolidation on land fragmentation. The main results are as follows: (a) most of the transferred plots and contracted plots were not spatially adjacent, suggesting that the tenants could not merge and consolidate both plots; (b) land transfer caused the LFI to increase by 2.85%, suggesting that land transfer had intensified the degree of land fragmentation to some extent; (c) if the transferred and contracted plots were non-adjacent or adjacent but unmerged and unconsolidated, then the LFI might increase or decrease; (d) if the transferred and contracted plots were spatially adjacent, merged, and consolidated, then the LFI decreased significantly.

TI  - Understanding heterogeneity in technology adoption among Indonesian smallholder dairy farmers
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - This study aims to understand and profile smallholder farmers' technology adoption status. We collected cross-sectional data from 600 smallholder dairy farming households in West Java, Indonesia. A Latent class cluster analysis identified two unique clusters of smallholder dairy farmers based on patterns in their adoption status of multiple dairy farming technologies. Cluster 1 (Low awareness/low adoption) had significantly lower awareness of all technologies, and among the "aware" farmers, technology adoption rates were also significantly lower compared to Cluster 2 (High awareness/high adoption). The Low awareness/low adoption cluster was older, had less formal education, managed fewer dairy cows, had less productive and less profitable dairy enterprises, lived further away from their cooperative and farmer group leader, and had fewer contacts with dairy extension staff. Farmers' responses to questions regarding reasons underpinning nonadoption decisions suggest that farmers face multilayered and heterogenous constraints to adopting dairy technologies. This insight can assist government, policymakers, and development professionals in designing technology dissemination programs that meet the unique characteristics of subgroups of farmers, ultimately improving the adoption of technologies.

TI  - AN INVESTIGATION AND CONDITION ASSESSMENT OF THE EXISTING WATER CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE IN SELECTED SMALLHOLDER IRRIGATION SCHEMES: CASE OF TUGELA FERRY IRRIGATION SCHEME AND MOOI RIVER IRRIGATION SCHEME, SOUTH AFRICA
T2  - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
AB  - This study investigated and evaluated the condition of the existing water conveyance, storage and control infrastructure in the Mooi River Irrigation Scheme (MRIS) and the Tugela Ferry Irrigation Scheme (TFIS), in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. An infrastructure condition assessment (ICA) was undertaken based on inspections and condition scoring or grading. In addition, technical experts were consulted to determine the weights of the structural evaluation criteria using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Furthermore, the fishbone 'Ishikawa' diagram and the relative causal index (RCI) method were used to carry out the root cause analysis (RCA). For RCI, questionnaires were administered to stakeholders to capture their perception of the causal factors. According to the study, the fishbone 'Ishikawa' diagram characterized and identified 23 probable causal factors that led to infrastructure dilapidation. The RCI quantified the causal factors and revealed the converging points between technical experts (te) and the extension workers (ex) regarding causal factors. The converging causal factors were related to maintenance (RCIte = 0.8, RCIex = 0.7), people (RCIte = 0.7, RCIex = 0.7), institutions (RCIte = 0.7, RCIex = 0.6) and the environment (RCIte = 0.8, RCIex = 0.7). The study further revealed that the stakeholders involved had points of divergence on causes of infrastructure decay. Follow-up questionnaires were again administered to discover the reasons for diverging thoughts. The study recommends participatory engagement in process and procedure design for enhanced infrastructure conditions. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Factors influencing the resilience of smallholder livestock farmers to agricultural drought in South Africa: Implication for adaptive capabilities
T2  - JAMBA-JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK STUDIES
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the factors that influence the resilience of smallholder farming households in the Northern Cape province of South Africa. This study utilised primary data collected from 207 smallholder livestock farmers and the probit model. The study contributes to the existing literature by constructing an agricultural drought resilience index (ADRI) as an outcome variable in order to determine the factors that influence the resilience of smallholder farmers to agricultural drought. The result revealed that only 9% of the smallholder livestock farmers were resilient to agricultural drought. Farming households with access to credit; farmers who received assistance from the government (such as training and feed) during drought and farmers who are part of a co-operative proved to be more resilient to agricultural drought. The policy implication of the findings of this study is for government and key role players in the industry to target disadvantaged smallholder farmers to build their resilience by enhancing their persistence and adaptability. Some of the assistance could be in the form of supplying fodder, strengthening access to agricultural credit and farm input, enhancing smallholder farmers' involvement in agricultural drought resilience activities by giving training and disseminating information. Finally, yet importantly, there is a need to enhance the resilience of farmers by educating farmers about the importance of getting involved in cooperatives and social networks. Furthermore, the findings of this study will help policymakers and stakeholders to formulate strategies and policy interventions that will boost smallholder farmers' resilience to agricultural drought.

TI  - Uniting forest and livelihood outcomes? Analyzing external actor interventions in sustainable livelihoods in a community forest management context
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS
AB  - External actor interventions in community forest management (CFM) attempt to support communities with developing forest institutions and/or improving their livelihoods portfolio. Common pool resource (CPR) scholars argue that forest institutions are required to prevent overharvesting of the forest resource stock (appropriation dilemma), and to encourage investment in its maintenance (provision dilemma). The sustainable livelihoods approach (SLA) has been widely used to analyse the influence of interventions on rural livelihoods portfolios. As interventions in CFM span the academic divide between CPR and SLA literatures, analysis of such interventions through either a CPR or SLA lens risks overlooking intervention activities, significant outcomes of the intervention, and the interplay between these outcomes. We propose here an analytical framework which combines CPR and SLA insights and ascertain its applicability by analysing interventions in a forest dependent community in Andhra Pradesh, India. We developed multiple indicators to measure the community's ability to deal with appropriation and provision dilemmas, and their livelihoods portfolio. Using data from forest plots, household questionnaires, focus group meetings and interviews, we analysed the intervention approaches, activities and outcomes. Our results show that a community's ability to deal with appropriation and provision dilemmas both affects, and is affected by its livelihoods portfolio. These intricate and dynamic interplays strongly influence the direct and indirect outcomes of intervention activities. Incorporating the synergy between the CPR and SLA perspectives in our analytical framework led us to a much more nuanced understanding of intervention approaches, activities and outcomes than would have otherwise been gained from a single perspective framework.

TI  - Determinants of agricultural households to join farmer producer organisations (FPOs) in Northeast India: evidence from Sikkim
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose - Government of India has launched FPOs to organise small and marginal farmers into farmer collectives called FPOs. These FPOs, through economies of scale, aim to provide better collective strength to farmers for better access to production technology, value-addition services, high-quality inputs and marketing services for improving their incomes. Recently, the government has launched a scheme for creation and promotion of 10,000 more FPOs in the country. Despite potential benefits of FPOs and encouragement from the Government, there are many farmers in India, particularly Sikkim, who do not join the FPOs. This study aims to identify the major determinants that motivate farmers to join FPOs.Design/methodology/approach- Primary data for this study was collected during October, 2019-February, 2020 from 560 farm households in all four districts of Sikkim, India. The study used two-sample t-test and FPO participation probit model for determining the factors influencinga household's decision to participate in an FPO.Findings - The results of this study illustrate that education, farming experience, farming as the primary occupation, size of landholding, access to Internet, distance to the nearest market, medium level of social participation, extension contact, transportation facility and plan to expand the scale of operation in future are the major explanatory variables that have statistically significant impact on the farm households' participation in FPOs.Research limitations/implications - This study was based on a cross-sectional survey. As a result, the findings may be subjected to some limitations though the study made all possible efforts to minimise the limitations.Originality/value -This paper is based on ora novel data set, collected specifically to examine the determinants of membership in Sikkim, India that has not been studiedbefore. Moreover, this study has identified the importance of information and awareness initiatives among the farmers as responsible for farmers' participation in FPOs. The findings of this study will have important implications and lessons to draw from for the Central Government's effort towards Formation and Promotion of 10,000 new FPOs, especially in the hilly states of India.

TI  - Factors influencing the grazing management styles of settled herders: a case study of Nagqu County, Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
AB  - The implementation of pasture contracting policies in the Tibetan Plateau has been of widespread concern in the scientific community and related government departments. Studying the effects of the implementation of pasture contracting policies will help us understand herders' attitudes toward those policies and to amend existing policies effectively. This paper analyzes 135 herder families' grazing management behavior using participatory rural appraisal (PRA), quantitative analysis and a Logistic regression model in three townships of Nagqu County in remote areas of the Tibetan Plateau, China. The results show that the herders have become settled and are no longer nomadic, so the settlement project has basically been completed and the policy of contracting for grazing rights is being gradually implemented in Nagqu County. Since the grazing rights and pastures were under contract, group-based management has been widely accepted in this area, which helps the herders deal with constraints, such as limited pasture area, a small grazing radius, controlled family animal husbandry and an uneven distribution of water. The herders that have more family members available for labor, higher proportion of family members with good health, and higher income from animal husbandry tend to choose household-based management. Herders tend to choose group-based management when higher quality winter pastures are available.

TI  - An analysis of farmers' net incomes from underplanted forest products: case studies from Hunan and Guangxi Provinces of China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - The development of underplanted forest products (UFPs) is one of the forest-related policies arising from the recent Collective Forest Tenure reforms in China. This study aimed to understand what might affect farmers' incomes from UFPs, the difficulties and barriers farmers face in developing UFPs, and the influence of the UFPs policy. A semi-structured questionnaire study and two qualitative interview studies with local households and local forest authority directors were administered in Guangxi and Hunan Provinces, China. A lack of related knowledge and market information was the major barrier to cultivating UFPs. The UFPs policy has had negligible influence in encouraging the development of UFPs. According to participants, the main difference between households that were and were not cultivating UFPs was related to improved market access and information. Interviewees felt that cooperation and support from the government and from UFP processors would enhance their interests in the cultivation of UFPs.

TI  - Quality versus solidarity: Third Wave coffee and cooperative values among smallholding Maya farmers in Guatemala
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - This article examines how a market shift toward high-end ('Third Wave') coffee creates tension between two producer models of economic engagement: cooperatives, with mechanisms that promote solidarity to minimize risks, and 'open' markets, with extraordinary rewards for those able to grow the highest quality coffees. Most Maya farmers value cooperative organization and yet a growing number are defecting, unable to forgo the premiums intermediaries offer for their best beans. This is a complicated moral and economic situation in which the Third Wave focus on single-origin coffees forces changes in relations of production that undermine the cooperative preferences of smallholding farmers.

TI  - Pluralism, poverty and sharecropping: Cultivating open-mindedness in development studies
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
CP  - Conference of the Development-Studies-Association
AB  - Pluralism adds depth to the mixing of methods in development studies. Global society has both structure and complexity, and agents within society actively promote competing ways of describing and interpreting that society. Theoretical pluralism offers a way for social scientists to describe and judge the competing theories about a given social situation. (Methodological pluralism is also discussed in this paper.) An example - tenancy in India - is explored to illustrate how pluralists compare theories. The tenancy literature includes neoclassical, institutionalist, and Marxist theories. These cut across three academic disciplines. Pluralist research is often interdisciplinary in such ways. Such interdisciplinary research generates a dialogue across epistemological chasms and across theories that have different underlying assumptions. Pluralist research can be valued for its discursive bridging function. Pluralist research can also contribute to improvements in scientific measurement. Divergent schools of thought can be brought into contact by reconceptualising the objects of research, such as contracts or coercion. In the tenancy literature, alternative ways of measuring and interpreting power arose. Structuralist approaches tended to assume poverty and inequality as part of the context within which economic action takes place. Strengths and weaknesses of such assumptions are examined. The approach recommended here, which is realist, makes possible an improved dialogue about policy changes aimed at poverty reduction.

TI  - Bird Responses to Lowland Rainforest Conversion in Sumatran Smallholder Landscapes, Indonesia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Rapid land-use change in the tropics causes dramatic losses in biodiversity and associated functions. In Sumatra, Indonesia, lowland rainforest has mainly been transformed by smallholders into oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) monocultures, interspersed with jungle rubber (rubber agroforests) and a few forest remnants. In two regions of the Jambi province, we conducted point counts in 32 plots of four different land-use types (lowland rainforest, jungle rubber, rubber plantation and oil palm plantation) as well as in 16 nearby homegardens, representing a small-scale, traditional agricultural system. We analysed total bird abundance and bird abundance in feeding guilds, as well as species richness per point count visit, per plot, and per land-use system, to unveil the conservation importance and functional responses of birds in the different land-use types. In total, we identified 71 species from 24 families. Across the different land-use types, abundance did not significantly differ, but both species richness per visit and per plot were reduced in plantations. Feeding guild abundances between land-use types were variable, but homegardens were dominated by omnivores and granivores, and frugivorous birds were absent from monoculture rubber and oil palm. Jungle rubber played an important role in harbouring forest bird species and frugivores. Homegardens turned out to be of minor importance for conserving birds due to their low sizes, although collectively, they are used by many bird species. Changes in functional composition with land-use conversion may affect important ecosystem functions such as biological pest control, pollination, and seed dispersal. In conclusion, maintaining forest cover, including degraded forest and jungle rubber, is of utmost importance to the conservation of functional and taxonomic bird diversity.

TI  - Willingness to Pay for Insured Loans in Northern Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Index insurance has been heralded as a potential solution to risk management problems faced by smallholder farmers in developing countries. Despite its potential, demand for standalone index insurance contracts has remained low in early field trials. We investigate the willingness to pay for drought index insurance-backed loans in northern Ghana using contingent valuation. We find that index insurance lowers overall demand for agricultural loans. We also compare micro-level index insurance, provided directly to farmers, with meso-level insurance, provided to the credit agency and find that farmers appear to prefer micro-level insurance. Finally, farmers are willing to pay to avoid basis risk.

TI  - An institutional analysis of Payment for Environmental Services on collectively managed lands in Ecuador
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - The application of Payment for Environmental Services (PES) programs on communal lands raises questions about how PES interacts with collective resource management institutions. We explore how an Ecuadorian payment program is associated with the development of rules to manage shared grazing lands. In addition, we assess the communal characteristics that make it more likely that a participant community will change their land-use rules. Our analysis draws from an almost complete census of participant communities in the Ecuadorian highlands (n = 44), a survey of non-participant communities (n = 23) and a household questionnaire (n = 420). We find that the majority of participant communities have strengthened their land-use rules since program participation. Communities that craft new rules and apply their rules are more likely to be organized and have internal monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. Poorer communities are also more likely to have made a rule change in response to participation; wealthier communities are more likely to maintain existent land-use institutions. We find no association between rule change and level of payment. Our results highlight the need to dis-aggregate the role of payments and contract commitment and to further analyze how community characteristics may influence the effectiveness and equity of PES in communal contexts.

TI  - Can humans outsmart rodents? Learning to work collectively and strategically
T2  - WILDLIFE RESEARCH
AB  - Context. Rodents are one of the major constraints in Asian rice production, both in pre- and post-harvest. Rodents are often perceived by farmers in developing countries to be consistently outsmarting humans - a belief that needs to be overcome. Ecologically based rodent management (EBRM) is a possible solution to manage rodent populations effectively, which in turn can help sustain food security in Asia. Well coordinated community action is necessary to effectively carry out EBRM. This paper considers the socio-cultural challenges of EBRM.
   Aims. To determine whether a multi-stakeholder partnership, facilitated through experiential learning and the use of existing social capital, can generate collective actions for strategic rodent management.
   Methods. Participatory action research was employed in the implementation of EBRM in irrigated rice systems in the Red River Delta in Vietnam. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used including household surveys, focus group discussions and key informant interviews.
   Key results. The multi-stakeholder partnership and participatory approach effectively generated adoption of EBRM. The strong linkages between extension and political organisations generated diffusion of EBRM into neighbouring provinces. The adoption of EBRM reduced rodenticide use (50%), decreased rice areas with rodent damage (93%), increased rice yields (10-14%), increased economic returns for farmers (20%), strengthened farmers' collective actions, and changed farmers' perspectives on rodent management towards a biologically sustainable approach.
   Conclusions. Humans can indeed outsmart rodents through the use of EBRM principles that rely on community actions. Sustainable community actions can be achieved through participatory approaches and a multi-stakeholder partnership built on existing social capital of the society and local communities. Overall, the adoption of EBRM meant better rice yields, higher economic returns for farmers, and reduced human health and environmental risks.
   Implications. To address the problem of sustainable adoption by farmers of an agricultural technology for natural resource management, active participation of various stakeholders through a multi-stakeholder partnership is essential. This partnership should emanate from the social capital of the society, such as the networks of organisations across different scales, from the national to the village level, and the cultural norms and values adhered to by the members of the society and local communities.

TI  - Does forestland possession enhance households' access to credit?-Examining China's forestland mortgage policy
T2  - ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY
AB  - Many countries have seen a rising demand for forest policy reform. This paper explores the effects of China's forestland mortgage policy, a supporting measure for collective forest tenure reform, on household credit access. In theory, the forestland mortgage policy could have three impacts on households: (1) forestland possession could change households' willingness to access credit (2) forestland possession could enhance household access to credit, and (3) the contract structure follows the theoretical predictions of the credit contract design mechanism. Our results show that households' willingness to enroll in the mortgage policy as well as their potential to obtain credit increased when households possessed larger areas of forestland. However, the proportion of households that successfully obtained credit were fairly modest. Meanwhile, we found a positive relationship between collateralized forestland and the amount of the forestland mortgage loan, and a negative relationship between collateralized forestland and the interest rate. These findings are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the contract mechanism design. The existing forestland mortgage policy has increased households' credit access to some extent; however, there is much room for improvement from a policy perspective. This requires divising policy arrangements that would facilitate a fully developed credit market available to households. Forest tenure mortgage loans alone may not be able to fully meet households' financial needs. (C) 2020 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Backyard fish farm features and farmers personal characteristics as correlates of profitability of aquaculture in Nigeria
T2  - SU URUNLERI DERGISI
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to deepen understanding of how farmer personal features and farm characteristics affect the profitability of backyard fish farms in south- south Nigeria. In order to achieve the aim of the study, primary data were collected on farmer and farm-based variables, using questionnaire from randomly selected fish farmers in 2018. Nested regression models were estimated to evaluate the separate and combined effects of farmer and farm characteristics of profitability. The results indicates that the mean age was 41 years, 84.4% of them were male and majority (90.0%) had secondary education and above. The mean farming experience was 8 years with mean household size of 9 persons. The findings revealed that backyard fish farming was profitable with a total revenue of N2, 233,800 (6111.63 USD), a total cost of N1, 404,280 (3842.08 USD) with a net income of N829520 (2269.55 USD) and BCR of 1.59. The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of 1.59 implies that every N1.00 invested in backyard fish farming will yield additional income of N0.59k. The result shows that backyard fish farms profitability responds positively to farmers personal characteristics (age, years of experience, gender, education and family size). Farmer personal characteristics significantly and jointly explained 37% variation in profitability. Farm characteristics (stocking density and fertilizer) significantly and positively (p<0.05) influenced profitability of backyard fish farms. The most important cost factors that negatively affected profitability are unit cost of feeds, fingerlings and water supply. It was recommended that backyard fish farmers should increase stock size, acquire more education as human capital development and form cooperative societies to address the constraint of inadequate access to credit facilities.

TI  - Farmer research networks enable community-based mycotoxin management in rural Indian villages
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - CONTEXT: Mycotoxins and other food safety and preservation challenges are prevalent in smallholder food systems, and communities often lack the knowledge and capacity required to effectively diagnose and address these concerns. Participatory research can facilitate innovation in resource-poor settings by fostering collective identity and leveraging endogenous systems of change, but there are limitations to the scalability and impact of this approach across contexts. Embedding participatory research within a farmer research network (FRN) has the potential to enhance the effectiveness of participatory research by enhancing the flow of knowledge between local and global innovation systems. OBJECTIVE: This study proposes a framework for FRN-mediated participatory food safety research and reports on key findings from an application of this approach in six villages in Unnao District, Uttar Pradesh, India. METHODS: A cohort of 184 households was organized into a FRN and engaged in a series of participatory research activities. Collective identity was developed within the FRN by reflecting on shared goals and establishing leadership. Participatory context characterization combined with multiple factor analysis (MFA) enabled formation of interest-based affinity groups, which explored potential solutions to a range of local problems. Affinity group deliberations led to the implementation of a FRN-wide hermetic grain storage intervention. Uptake of the technology was evaluated by monitoring continued usage, willingness-to-pay, price elasticity of demand, and retail sales across localities. Efficacy of the FRN approach for participatory food safety research was assessed by monitoring participation, motives, and experiential outcomes among members. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Context characterization revealed distinct needs profiles influenced by the extent of home versus non-home time allocation and economic orientation. Household trials of hermetic sacks were effective in 99% (128/129) of participating households, with 83% continuing use in subsequent seasons. Willingness-to-pay analysis demonstrated substantial demand for hermetic sacks but high price elasticity across hypothetical price points. Despite demonstrable demand and positive reception, actual sales were low (<10 units) due to perceived high cost of the technology. Participation and experiential outcomes were generally positive, but the FRN was not successful in maintaining adequate, representative gender balance in its programming. SIGNIFICANCE: This study documents a novel application of the FRN approach to participatory food safety research and constitutes substantial evidence for the potential for FRNs to catalyze local-global knowledge feedback loops. The model outlined is widely adaptable and could be used across contexts in India and elsewhere.

TI  - Health insurance of rural/township schoolchildren in Pinggu, Beijing: coverage rate, determinants, disparities, and sustainability
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB  - Background: As China re-establishes its health insurance system through various cooperative schemes, little is known about schoolchildren's health insurance. This paper reports findings from a study that examined schoolchildren's insurance coverage, disparities between farmer and non-farmer households, and effects of low-premium cooperative schemes on healthcare access and utilization. It also discusses barriers to sustainable enrollment and program growth.
   Method: A survey of elementary school students was conducted in Pinggu, a rural/suburban district of Beijing. Statistical analyses of association and adjusted odds ratio via logistic regression were conducted to examine various aspects of health insurance.
   Results: Children's health insurance coverage rose to 54% by 2005, the rates are comparable for farmers' and non-farmer's children. However, 76% of insured farmers' children were covered under a low-premium scheme protecting only major medical events, compared to 42% among insured non-farmers' children. The low-premium schemes improved parental perceptions of children's access to and affordability of healthcare, their healthcare-seeking behaviors, and overall satisfaction with healthcare, but had little impact on utilization of outpatient care.
   Conclusion: Enrolling and retaining schoolchildren in health insurance are threatened by the limited tangible value for routine care and low reimbursement rate for major medical events under the low-premium cooperative schemes. Coverage rates may be improved by offering complimentary and supplementary benefit options with flexible premiums via a multi-tier system consisting of national, regional, and commercial programs. Health insurance education by means of community outreach can reinforce positive parental perceptions, hence promoting and retaining insurance enrollment in short-term.

TI  - The complexity of barriers to biogas digester dissemination in Indonesia: challenges for agriculture waste management
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB  - In the global south, the use of firewood and LPG as dominant energy sources for cooking contributes to socio-ecological issues. Alternatively, biogas is considered a clean energy source generated from organic waste. However, in Indonesia, until 2018, only less than 2% of households utilized biogas for cooking fuel. This research aims to explore the landscape of biogas governance in Indonesia, its fragmentation, and its relation with biodigester dissemination. This study found that there is fragmentation within small-medium scale national biogas programs in Indonesia. Seven national government biogas programs have similar governance arrangements and characteristics; scattered in different departments within the ministry, using the grant approach with two main vendors, often overlapping with local government programs, and not providing proper monitoring and evaluation mechanism, as well as proper training for users. Meanwhile, the biogas program by a non-government organization utilizes a semi-commercial approach; collaborating with multiple stakeholders (governments, local construction partner organizations, cooperatives, and private sectors-companies and banks); and has standardized training and after-sale services. Within those biogas programs, there are multiple barriers along the supply chain process of biodigester dissemination. These barriers relate to the governance aspect of biogas programs. Fragmented governance affected the capability of each program to tackle barriers in biogas digester dissemination. Besides, heavy subsidy on LPG by the government reduced attraction to biogas. This study shows technology adoption barriers beyond the user/individual aspects. It shows interaction among different factors such as policy, the governance of technology transfer, technical production issues, and socio-cultural problems.

TI  - Positioning smallholder farmers in the dairy innovation system in Malawi: A perspective of actors and their roles
T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - The preference of an innovation systems approach to development is based on its inclusiveness and the interactions of actors to co-influence each other, to learn and innovate and to bring about tangible benefits. As more actors with diverse interests engage, the innovation system becomes more complex and actors with higher influence power are likely to benefit more. Smallholder farmers in developing countries are the core actors of an agricultural innovation system, but their ability to influence other actors to maximize their benefits is questionable. This article applies a historical analysis of the progressive development and complexity of Malawi's diary innovation system through phased emphasis on technological, organizational and institutional development to illustrate the centrality of smallholder dairy farmers in the innovation system. A social network analysis is applied to assess the influence of smallholder farmers on other actors. The existence and growth of the diary innovation system in Malawi is founded on the resilience of smallholder dairy farmers to produce milk. Whereas the smallholder farmers are the most connected in terms of interaction, they have the least influence on other actors in the innovation system. To take advantage of their central position to maximize benefits, smallholder farmers can only rely on their collective power to influence others. Organizing farmers in groups and associations is a step in the right direction but deliberate interventions by innovation brokers as intermediaries need to focus on empowering these groups.

TI  - Cash transfers and multiplier effect: lessons from the grain subsidy program in China
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the multiplier effects of the grain subsidy program in China, which is a large food self-sufficiency project that is implemented as a cash transfer program. Income multiplier effects have not been empirically examined in the evaluation of the grain subsidy program although increasing the income of farmers is the original goal of this project.
   Design/methodology/approach - A large number of household-level observations are employed to measure the program's income multiplier. An unrestricted model was first employed to measure the multipliers in a period of two years, and the difference was evaluated. Then, the income promotion effects of grain subsidy on various income sources for each specific subset of the population, such as liquidity conditions and household characteristics, were estimated.
   Findings - The results show that the grain subsidy program has a high income multiplier, and the income promotion effect of the transferred subsidies is from agricultural production derived by intensifying input for each unit of land. The multiplier effect of the grain subsidy program as a cash transfer program can be interpreted as the shadow value of relaxing liquidity constraints and could be particularly utilized by households with more farming land and farmers in less developed regions in China. Hence, to maximize the income multiplier effect, the grain subsidy distribution method should consider these criteria instead of retaining the prevalent standard that is based on contracted land areas.
   Originality/value - This study addresses the gap that the effect of China's grain subsidy program on income increment has not been empirically examined in nation wide.

TI  - Factors influencing savings among land reform beneficiaries in South Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to determine the effects of socio-economic factors of land redistribution for agricultural development project beneficiaries on savings in the North West Province, South Africa. Design/methodology/approach A binary logistic regression model was employed to determine the effects of socio-economic factors of project beneficiaries on their savings. Findings The results show that the average number of trainings attended by the beneficiaries, the proportion of youth per project and the average net farm income of the project positively and significantly influence the level of savings by the beneficiaries. About 62 percent of the beneficiaries did not have savings; thus, only 38 percent of beneficiaries had savings. Of the 38 percent who had savings, the majority (77 percent) had an annual net farm income of less than R1,000. Only 2 percent of the projects had an annual net farm income of more than R10,000.
   Social implications The research findings point out to the importance of saving. With savings, a household is in a better position to deal with situations that arises in case of emergency. Originality/value This paper is among the few studies to analyze the determinants of savings at a group or project level. Most studies are done at household or individual level.

TI  - Farm household differentiation in upper-catchments of Northern Vietnam: The key role of access to water?
T2  - CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB  - In mountainous areas of Northern Vietnam, the redistribution of land use rights, market liberalization, and new forestry policies have had important impacts on the strategies of agricultural households. Upper-catchments of these areas are characterized by a great diversity in socio-economic conditions. A questionnaire survey was carried out with 120 households living in a mountainous district of Yen Bai province to identify the major differentiating factors of farms and the major livelihood strategies. The paper builds upon a typology based on production factors (water, land of different qualities), market integration, and off-farm activities. Among these variables, access to water appears to be a major factor in the differentiation of farms. A breakdown of the different types of access to water (water available during 1 or 2 cropping seasons, individual vs. collective) shows that beyond a seemingly egalitarian distribution of land during de-collectivization, access to water is now very unequal. Some households are under-using their water resources, while others who lack access to water are forced to use their sloping land for rainfed rice cultivation. A different distribution of access to water, through new infrastructures or new allocation rules, could improve the living conditions of the less advantaged households and possibly reduce the problem of overexploitation of sloping lands.

TI  - Beyond focus: Exploring variability of service provision of agricultural cooperatives
T2  - ANNALS OF PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - The wide array of services provided by agricultural cooperatives for their members is often not considered in academic studies. Addressing this gap in the literature, our paper explores the wide array of services provided by agricultural cooperatives and how these extend beyond those they were initially intended to provide. We study the extent and characteristics of service portfolios from 511 agricultural cooperatives in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. Results from two-limit Tobit models confirm that government and NGO-initiated cooperatives have a wide service portfolio compared to member-initiated cooperatives. In many of the studied cooperatives, the services they provide and their portfolios are more diverse than expected. Cooperatives seem to go beyond their focal areas of intervention. Also, those cooperatives that are more outward-oriented and where the chair has contact with other cooperatives or businesses, have a wider service portfolio. These results may help to explain the mixed findings on the impact of cooperative membership.

TI  - Typology of contract farming arrangements: a transaction cost perspective
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - This paper proposes an alternative typology of contract farming arrangements (CFA) based on transaction cost theory. To construct the typology, we first surveyed managers of agribusiness firms and contracted farmers in Zimbabwe to understand the provisions in their contracts, the motivations for their inclusion and the level of transaction attributes, particularly the sub-categories of asset specificity and uncertainty. We then developed a two-by-two matrix of contract types based on the interaction of transaction attributes. The results show that four contract types can be distinguished: total, group, lean and market contracts. Furthermore, CFAs that are misaligned with transaction attributes have problems of side-selling and inefficiency. Our new empirically based categorisation can help managers and policymakers to design CFAs that match with underlying transaction attributes, thus enhancing the stability and efficiency of CFAs.

TI  - Spatial Justice and Residents' Policy Acceptance: Evidence from Construction Land Reduction in Shanghai, China
T2  - LAND
AB  - Nowadays, the contradiction between strict construction land supply restriction and excessive construction land demand is extremely prominent. Construction land reduction (CLR) is a policy innovation for economically developed regions designed to solve the tight constraints of the construction land quota as urban development continues in China, however, it leads to a lack of spatial justice. In this study, we address a gap in land use regulation literature regarding regional economic development in fast-developing nations by presenting a quantitative investigation of spatial justice in Shanghai, China. We theoretically analyze the connotation of spatial justice in CLR and its influence on residents' policy acceptance of CLR. Based on theoretical analysis and using household questionnaires from JJ Town in W District, Shanghai, China, we investigate how spatial justice affects residents' policy acceptance of CLR through an ordered probit model. The results show that (1) spatial justice strengthens residents' policy acceptance of CLR; (2) both policy familiarity and participation are important influencing factors that contribute to residents' policy acceptance of CLR; (3) age, education, household income, the contracting land scale and household population structure also affect residents' policy acceptance of CLR. (4) Robustness tests support the above findings. Thus, in the process of CLR, it is essential to fully consider the realization of spatial justice to ensure the development of remote suburbs, especially the regions experiencing a net reduction in their construction land.

TI  - Production level, feed conversion efficiency, and nitrogen use efficiency of dairy production systems in China
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - A study was conducted in China to evaluate the feed conversion efficiency, nitrogen use efficiency, and the amount of human-edible grains fed under different dairy systems. Three dairy systems were defined and studied: (i) smallholder subsistence farms (SH), (ii) peri-urban farms (PR), and iii) cooperative farms (CO). The PR system had the highest milk yield, better feed conversion efficiency, better nitrogen use efficiency, and used lower proportion of grains in the diet. Within a system, different farms had wide variations in feed conversion efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency, suggesting the need to improve management practices within the system. Among the three systems, SH and CO systems require the most improvements in the management practices.

TI  - Market participation among smallholder farmers in Tanzania: determining the dimensionality and influence of psychological contracts
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose Smallholder farmers in Tanzania were investigated in this paper to determine the dimensions and influence of psychological contracts on smallholder farmers' decisions to participate in the market. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through structured questionnaires, of which a cross-sectional design was conducted in central Tanzania, the Dodoma region in which 467 smallholder farmers were surveyed. First, a preliminary Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted by involving psychological contracts and market participation items derived from previous studies. This was followed by the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to verify the items obtained in the EFA. The regression analysis was then performed to test the causal effects of psychological contracts on market participation among smallholder farmers. Findings The path analysis revealed that transactional, relational, and ideological contracts have a positive and statistically significant impact on the participation of smallholder farmers in the market. Therefore, smallholder farmers have own set of expectations for participating in the marketplace. As a result, smallholder farmers' relationships with market participation decisions can be strengthened. Research limitations/implications This study covered only smallholder farmers. However, future studies can include large-scale farmers, because psychological contracts and market participation difficulties also apply to them. This may increase the generalizability of the findings. Originality/value Past studies have not extensively covered the psychological contracts in smallholder farming, especially in market participation. Based on prior empirical and theoretical research from other disciplines, the findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the psychological contract framework and the significance of multiple psychological obligations between smallholder farmers and market management.

TI  - The relevance of business practices in linking smallholders and large agro-businesses in Sub-Sahara Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Smallholders often have to certify according to international standards and produce under contract for large agro-businesses to access export markets. While mostly positive effects for the farmers have been found for contracts and certifications, often these effects do not persist because contracts fail and certifications are not renewed. We suggest that individual firm behavior is crucial for the long-term success of farmeragro- business relationships. In this article, we use data of 386 smallholders in the pineapple export sector in Ghana, analyze them quantitatively and enrich it by a detailed case study of a large-scale agro-business in Ghana. The results show that, in an environment with weak contract enforcement, certification is an agent of change in farmer-agro-business relations and that building trust and aligning expectations of farmers and firms largely determine success. We conclude that individual firm behavior matters more than taken into account in previous research. Our case study shows that three 'R' - reliability, reputation and respect -constitute the basis for contract relationships that benefit all.

TI  - Correlates of unequal access to preventive care in China: a multilevel analysis of national data from the 2011 China Health and Nutrition Survey
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Preventive care has an essential role in reducing income-related health inequalities. Despite a general consensus of the need of shifting focus from disease treatment to wellness and prevention, little is known about inequalities in access to preventive care in China. Our study aimed to explore the inequalities in preventive care usage and factors that were associated with such inequalities among Chinese adults.
   Methods: Multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed using national data from the 2011 Chinese Health and Nutrition Survey. The study sample comprised 13,483 adults who were covered by Basic Social Medical Insurance (BSMI). We analyzed individual socioeconomic status (marital status, education attainment, annual household income per capita, and medical insurance) and contextual factors for their influence on preventive care usage (region of residence and type of community) after controlling for health needs (age, sex, and health condition).
   Results: Out of the participants, 6.9 % received preventive care services over the past four weeks and 3.9 % went for a general physical examination prior to the survey. We noted regional disparities in the overall use of preventive care and specific use of general physical examination, with residents from central and northeastern regions less likely to use preventive care including general physical examination than in the more affluent eastern region. Lower levels of education and income were associated with reduced use of preventive care. Subscriptions to less generous social medical insurance programs such as Urban Resident-based Medical Insurance Scheme or New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme were associated with decreased specific use of general physical examinations, but not overall use of preventive care.
   Conclusions: Inequalities in preventive care usage were evident in China, and were associated with health needs and socioeconomic characteristics. Current health insurance arrangements may fail to reduce inequalities relating to preventive care. A fair and more coherent policy across all BSMI schemes is needed.

TI  - Managing Rangeland as a Complex System: How Government Interventions Decouple Social Systems from Ecological Systems
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - The complexity of natural resource management is increasingly recognized and requires adaptive governance at multiple levels. It is particularly significant to explore the impacts of government interventions on the management practices of local communities and on target social-ecological systems. The Inner Mongolian rangeland was traditionally managed by indigenous people using their own institutions that were adapted to the highly variable local climate and were able to maintain the resilience of the social-ecological system for more than 1000 years. However, external interventions have significantly affected the rangeland social-ecological system in recent decades. In this paper, using livestock breed improvement as an example, we track government interventions from the traditional era through the collective period to the present market economy period based on a review of historical documents and case studies. Using the concept of social-ecological system resilience, we diagnose the impacts of interventions on livestock breed management in the rangeland social-ecological system, and discuss how these interventions occur. We found that government interventions in livestock breeding have gradually decoupled the pastoral society from its supporting ecological system. During this process, external powers have increasingly displaced the local community in defining the nature of rangeland management. Power asymmetry and discourse have contributed to this displacement.

TI  - Effect of Imposed Self-Governance on Irrigation Rules Design among Horticultural Producers in Peri-Urban Kenya
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - While high urban vegetable demand has driven unprecedented intensification of small private irrigation in peri-urban Kenya, absence of appropriate local governance mechanisms has necessitated interventions by concerned state agencies. Based on Ostrom's design principles for sustainable commons, this paper evaluates the robustness of the irrigation management regime emanating from involuntary self-governance among peri-urban farmers. Findings show that since conflicts were fueled by water scarcity peaks corresponding with market price peaks, the interventions overemphasized facilitating water sharing among users. With conflicting users viewed as the problem by the agency, their experiences with the resource system, existing social structures, and resource use dynamics causing conflicts were largely ignored in the change process. Consequently, narrowly focused use rules that failed to properly define important resource parameters resulted. Further, user drawing rights have no significant input requirement, monitoring of water resource condition and sanctioning of deviant behavior are overlooked due to a lack of sufficient social capital and commitment to the collective establishment. Although inherent conflicts signify high economic valuation of water access by users, the lack of local ownership of the transition process made the policy interventions fail to produce rules that can guarantee sustainable irrigation development in an environment characterized by intensive irrigation and agrochemicals application, and growing domestic and industrial water demand. Therefore, recognizing water as a commercial input, recognizing conflicting users and their experiences as an essential solution, and integrating them in a participatory manner in subsequent institutional change is deemed necessary for effective governance in the post-conflict setup.

TI  - Seasonality and wage responsiveness in a developing agrarian economy
T2  - OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS
AB  - This paper studies the wage responsiveness of labour supply and demand, simultaneously addressing the twin issues of the non-clearing of developing rural labour markets and seasonality. It employs a data set pertaining to south-central India, and limits itself to the agricultural market for daily-rated labour(by far the predominant form of wage contract in the sample villages). Estimating a theoretically robust and empirically justified disequilibrium model of the agricultural labour market, we find no evidence of backward-bending supply curves or 'vertical' demand curves, contrary to findings in the literature. Further, while the agricultural labour market appears to be in equilibrium during the kharif (or rainy) season, it manifests excess supply in the rabi (or post-rainy) season.

TI  - Sources of agricultural extension information and farmers' willingness to pay for the information: Evidence from small-scale pineapple farmers in south-eastern Ghana
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This paper examines sources, preferred format and language of agricultural extension information and the willingness of pineapple farmers to pay for the information. It is based on analysis of data collected using the structured interview schedule method administered on 132 small-scale pineapple farmers randomly selected from 14 communities in the Akuapem South District of south-eastern Ghana. Agricultural extension agents (96.7%), cooperative societies (83.3%), colleague farmers (70%) and platforms offered by workshops and training sessions (63.3%) were identified as predominant sources of agricultural extension information. Besides, the study showed that 40.9% of farmers were willing to pay for such services, with 28.8% expressing their unwillingness. The results of a chi-square analysis showed a significant relationship between pineapple farmers' willingness to pay for agricultural extension information with respect to sex, age, educational level, household size, years of experience, farm size, and position in the society. However, marital status and membership of cooperative societies of pineapple farmers were not significant (at rho <= 0.05) and therefore did not affect the pineapple farmers' willingness to pay for such services. The paper makes a strong case for policy direction that deepens private sector participation and supports a more balanced public-private-partnership arrangement for extension delivery. This may stimulate pluralistic extension delivery, introduce a lot more diversity and enhance farmer acceptance of the need to invest in extension information. This study represents the first-ever study in Ghana on willingness to pay for extension information that focuses exclusively on producers of a horticultural commodity (small-scale pineapple farmers) with their distinguishing characteristic features.

TI  - Is contract farming a risk management instrument for Chinese farmers? Evidence from a survey of vegetable farmers in Shandong
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
CP  - International Conference on Agricultural Risk and Food Security (ARFS)
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate contract farming in China, using vegetable production as a case. Specifically, the authors analyze farmers' contract decisions for different types of contracts, their contract compliance behaviors, and their profitability affected by the contracts both analytically and empirically.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors assume growers with alternative risk preferences make the contract decisions to maximize their expected utilities, under exogenous market price risks and contract terms determined by the processor or wholesaler. Both fixed price and floating price contracts are analyzed. Two surveys of 185 and 85 farm households, respectively, are obtained in Shandong province in 2010, and econometric analyses with both Logit and least square regressions are conducted.
   Findings - The results indicate that the determining factors for contract farming are related to farmers' risk attitude, gender, yield, farm size and labor availability. However, contrary to the common belief that contracts are a risk management tool for risk averse farmers, the risk lovers tend to use contract farming instead of risk averters. Female household heads and farms with more labors tend not to use contracts, but larger farms with more acreage are more likely to contract. These suggest Chinese farmers' primary motivation of contracting is not market price risk management, but rather seeking better offers and marketing transaction cost reduction.
   Originality/value - The authors believe that this is the first econometric study to analyze contract farming allowing different types of contracts in China. The scenarios include cases without contracts, with fixed price contracts, and with floating price contracts, where the contract price changes to reflect the market price, a very unique yet popular situation in China. Each of the cases is also considered under the situation whether default is possible.

TI  - A National Governance Perspective on the Transformation of Rural Property Rights: The Chinese Experience
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES IN CHINA
AB  - Property rights have multiple attributes, and these are correlated with national governance. In the West, property rights have the economic function of maximizing efficiency and the political function of rights protection, but in China, they also have a strong social character. With the modernization of national governance, these functions interact with and transform each other. When the state's ability to supply public goods is relatively weak, property rights take on more of a social character, meeting public demand for welfare at the grassroots level. When the state is better able to provide public goods, the social function of property rights lessens as their economic function grows. The social character of property rights was the institutional foundation for China, as a huge agrarian state, to realize "governance through inaction," and at the same time was the secret key that could break the code to the millennial continuity of Chinese agrarian civilization. Reforms including the collectivization of rural property rights after 1949, the "separation of two rights" (to collective ownership and household contracted land, with a focus on the latter), and the "separation of three rights," (to collective ownership, household contracts and revitalized land management). These changes constitute a process in which the economic function of property rights has been growing while their social character has lessened under conditions of national governance modernization.

TI  - Perceived land tenure security in rural Xinjiang, China: The role of official land documents and trust
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - The role of formal tenure institutions in reducing land tenure insecurity has been long debated in the development economics literature. This study examines and compares the key determinants of perceptions of security of tenure over contract land and wasteland, two types of land that are characterized by tenure being formally and informally ascribed. The material is drawn from the Chinese region of Xinjiang, an ethnically heterogeneous region which has more complex tenure systems than elsewhere in China. Empirical estimations based on a survey of 352 households, complemented by interviews with key informants, demonstrate that formal institutions (measured by official land documents) do not significantly contribute to households' perceptions of tenure security on either type of land, and that both interpersonal trust and political trust significantly enhance perceived tenure security on either land type in our research area. The empirical evidence further shows that perceptions of tenure security on both types of land are more sensitive to trust towards village cadres than trust in villagers. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Impact of Contract Farming on Farmers' Income: A Case of Wuchang Rice in China
T2  - JARQ-JAPAN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY
AB  - This study aims to examine the revenue effects of rice contract farming for small high-value rice farmers and explore the constraints on the adoption of contract farming in China using a face-to-face survey questionnaire as the main instrument of data collection. A probit model and ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression analysis were used to estimate the likelihood of participation in contract farming and the impact of contract farming on rice farmers' income, respectively. A total of 78 household questionnaires collected in Wuchang was considered valid for analysis. This study proves that participating in contract farming is an effective way of increasing rice farmers' income, after control for observable and unobservable household characteristics. Specifically, contract farming contributes toward enhancing the rice farm-gate price and cost-profit ratio. The results also reveal that rice farmers with organic or green planting experience are more likely to participate in contract farming.

TI  - Groundwater management institutions in the face of rapid urbanization - Results of a framed field experiment in Bengaluru, India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Many aquifers in semi-arid and arid regions with rapid urbanization are over-exploited or even at the point of depletion. Driven by the increased demand for food and other agricultural products, irrigated agriculture constitutes the biggest user of groundwater, and has thus contributed to this critical situation. In this paper, we compare different designs of groundwater management institutions in order to avoid aquifer over-exploitation and ensure secure water sources. We assess externally imposed reward-based and punishment rules as well as communication on their effectiveness to reduce water extraction behavior of groundwater users. Moreover, we evaluate how different user types affect the outcome of these institutional designs. To do so, we conducted a framed field experiment with 600 households along the rural-urban interface of the fast growing city of Bengaluru, India. Results indicate that all treatments can prolong the life of the resource but reward-based and punishment rules seem to be more effective than communication. Moreover, we find that user type behavior identified in the baseline trial is persistent in the treatment trial despite interventions.

TI  - Contract bonus systems to encourage biosecurity adoption on small-scale broiler farms in Indonesia
T2  - ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB  - Ongoing economic losses in the poultry industry, due to endemic diseases such as highly pathogenic avian influenza and Newcastle disease, ensure that biosecurity adoption on small-scale broiler farms remains a priority for Indonesia. However, given their economic constraints and the nature of the market for their products, these smallholders need to be convinced that there is an economic benefit to them from investing in biosecurity. As the majority of smallholders manage their birds under a contract, these contract companies not only need to be involved in the discussion but, if they are not prepared to assist directly in assisting with improved biosecurity, need to ensure that the conditions of the contract do encourage this smallholder investment. Every contract includes price and performance bonuses and, although the nature of these vary between contract companies, they are designed to encourage productivity improvement. This study evaluates existing contract bonus systems in six major contract companies in Indonesia and their capacity to encourage investment in biosecurity. Results indicated that the price bonus plays a significant role in providing additional smallholder income. If higher than expected sale prices are obtained, contracts with companies 3, 5 and 6 ensure that a greater proportion of this price is passed on to smallholders. Contracts 2, 4, and 6 provide farmers with higher performance bonuses, indicating that these companies encourage farmers to improve production efficiency. Overall estimates after the initial year of biosecurity investment show improvements in returns, where farmers can receive up to USD 2.73 for every dollar invested in biosecurity.

TI  - Oil Palm Expansion among Smallholder Farmers in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Many tropical regions are experiencing a rapid growth of oil palm cultivation. In Indonesia, the world's leading palm oil producer, in addition to large companies, smallholder farmers are increasingly engaged in the oil palm sector. Smallholder oil palm cultivation may contribute to income gains and socio-economic development. However, land-use decisions by smallholders are not well understood. Without appropriate policies, negative social and environmental consequences can also occur. To improve the knowledge base, we use data about present and past land-use decisions from a survey of farm households in Sumatra. Employing duration models, we analyse the determinants and dynamics of oil palm adoption among smallholders. We find that independently operating farmers are currently driving growth rates in the oil palm sector. Smallholder adoption decisions are mainly attributable to regional and village level factors. While the current adoption primarily occurs outside of contracts, previous contractual ties between companies and other farmers in the same village play an important role for individual decisions. Beyond initial adoption, we also analyse later expansion decisions. While expanding the oil palm area subsequent to initial adoption is common among all types of adopters, those without previous contracts are found to expand significantly faster. We conclude that the concessions the government has allocated to palm oil companies in the past have initiated oil palm adoption in the small farm sector, but that the ensuing land-use dynamics are mostly beyond government control. Some wider implications are discussed.

TI  - Gendered division of labour and feminisation of responsibilities in Kenya; implications for development interventions
T2  - GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE
AB  - Analysing gender roles as a social organisation element of a community is critical for understanding actors' rationales and agency with regard to allocation and use of resources. This article discusses gender relations and how they determine development outcomes, based on a highland-lowland case-study of participants of Farmer Field Schools in Kakamega Central Sub-County (highland) and Mbeere South Sub-County (lowland). The gender relations at stake include the gendered division of labour, gender roles and intra-household power relations as expressed in access and control of resources and benefits and their implications for agricultural development. The study used mixed methods, the Harvard Analytical Framework of gender roles and draws on the Neo-Marxist position on exploitation, categorisation and institutionalisation of power relations, empowerment and the critical moments framework to discuss the results. Results in both Sub-Counties show that patriarchy prevails, determining institutional design, access and control of resources and benefits. Social positions shape capabilities and strategies of actors in decision-making and use of resources to justify gender-specific institutional arrangements. In Kakamega, men get the lion share of incomes from contracted sugarcane farming despite overburdening workloads on women, while in Mbeere, both men and women derive incomes from Khat (Catha Edulis) enterprises. However, women are expected to spend their earnings on household expenditures, which were hitherto responsibilities of men, thereby contributing to the feminisation of responsibilities. Development policies and interventions thus need to be based on an understanding of men and women's differential access and control over resources and the institutions underpinning men and women's bargaining power in order to adopt more effective measures to reduce gender inequalities. ResumenAnalizar los roles de genero como un elemento de organizacion social de una comunidad es fundamental para comprender los fundamentos de las y los actores y su agencia con respecto a la asignacion y uso de los recursos. Este articulo analiza las relaciones de genero y como estas determinan los resultados del desarrollo, basandose en un estudio de caso de participantes de las tierras altas y bajas de Farmer Field Schools en el subcondado Kakamega (tierras altas) y el subcondado de Mbeere (tierras bajas). Las relaciones de genero en cuestion incluyen la division del trabajo por genero, los roles de genero, las relaciones de poder intra-hogar expresadas en el acceso y control de los recursos y los beneficios y sus implicancias para el desarrollo agricola. El estudio utiliza metodos mixtos, el Marco Analitico de Harvard sobre los roles de genero y se basa en una postura neomarxista sobre la explotacion, la categorizacion y la institucionalizacion de las relaciones de poder, el empoderamiento y el marco analitico de momentos clave para analizar los resultados. En ambos subcondados, los resultados muestran que prevalece el patriarcado, determinando el diseno institucional, el acceso y control de los recursos y beneficios. Las posiciones sociales dan forma a las capacidades y las estrategias de los actores en la toma de decisiones y uso de recursos para justificar los arreglos institucionales especificos de genero.
   En Kakamega, los hombres se quedan con la mayor parte de los ingresos del cultivo contratado de la cana de azucar a pesar de la sobrecarga de trabajo que hay sobre las mujeres, mientras que en Mbeere, tanto estas como los varones obtienen ingresos de los emprendimientos del khat (Catha edulis). Sin embargo, se espera que las mujeres utilicen sus ingresos para gastos del hogar, los que solian ser responsabilidad de los hombres, contribuyendo asi a la feminizacion de las responsabilidades. Las politicas e intervenciones de desarrollo por lo tanto necesitan basarse en un entendimiento del diferente acceso y control de los recursos entre hombres y mujeres y de las instituciones que apuntalan el poder de negociacion entre ambos para poder adoptar medidas mas efectivas para reducir las desigualdades de genero. ???????????????????,???????????????????????????????????????(??)????????(??)???????????????????,??????,?????????????????????????????,????,???????????,?????????????,?????????????????????,?????????????,??????????????????????????,??????????????,????????????????????,???????,??????????????????????????????????????????,???????,??????????????????,?????????????????????,????????????????;?????,???????????????(????)??,???????????????????,??????????,????????????????????????????????????????,????????????????,?????????????????

TI  - The Impact of Access to Cooperatives on Households' Income: An Empirical Study in Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - If one is looking for an organization that will be responsive to community needs, stimulate economic growth, and raise people's income, cooperatives should be an obvious choice (Calkins & Ngo, 2005; Larocque et al., 2002). This paper investigates whether the households' income is affected by the access to cooperatives for the case of Phong Dien district, Can Tho city of Vietnam. Data used are directly collected from 250 households that are both participating (120 observations) and not participating in the cooperatives in Truong Long, Tan Thoi, Nhon Ai and Nhon Nghia communes. By using the Probit model, the findings show that there are three statistically significant factors affecting the ability of farm households to participate in the cooperatives at the 1 percent level including land area, distance to market center, and education level. In addition, the PSM model analysis suggests that the average income of cooperative members is significantly higher than that of non-members, about 40.880 million VND/year at the significance level of 1 percent. The empirical results imply that being a cooperative member is a significant contributory factor toward an increase in household income. Based on the research findings, several recommendations to improve the households' income are proposed.

TI  - Stabilizing Forests and Communities: Accommodative Buffering within China's Collective Forest Tenure Reform
T2  - CHINA QUARTERLY
AB  - China's recent collective forest tenure reform is intended to clarify and certify forest rights, and thereby promote market circulation of forestland, encourage forestry production and safeguard conservation. Central policy statements prioritize parcelling tenure among households to promote efficient management. This study examines how participants experienced the programme in communities in north-west Yunnan. In the study area, rather than individualizing tenure, forestry agencies compelled communities to re-collectivize forests. Nonetheless, residents persist in using household forests despite restrictions. Local officials tacitly sanction these activities. In mountain hinterlands, forest tenure reform has been focused on stabilizing forests and communities. Rather than forcibly impose tenure designs, authorities perform what we call accommodative buffering. A set of formal institutions, rules and mappings enables projects like forest ecological compensation payments to go forward. However, state agents at local and higher levels tolerate informal practices that contain the trouble that poorly fitted formal institutions might cause. While potentially more resilient than by-the-book enforcement, these arrangements could leave residents vulnerable to political shifts that require a demonstration of policy adherence.

TI  - The Effect of Social Networks on Smallholder Farmers' Decision to Join Farmer-Base Seed Producer Cooperatives (FBSc): The Case of Hararghe, Oromia, Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The paper presents the results of analysis conducted to empirically establish the role of social network in smallholder farmers' decision to join seed producer cooperative, in Hararghe, Oromia, Ethiopia. We used a 'random matching within sample' technique to generate data on social links and resources shared like information among their links. Average treatment effects were used to limit 'non-awareness' or 'selection bias' on participation rate. An econometric strategy was employed to isolate endogenous effect from correlated and contextual social network effects and analyzed by Probit model. Rainfall data was obtained from NMA for 1986-2018 years and analyzed by coefficient of variation (CV) and standardized anomalies index (Z). The result CV and Z shows intra- and inter seasonal variability of rainfall and, the severity and frequency of drought have increase which works against a single optimum seed source. Rate of membership to FBSc was 75% for exposed sub-sample against 70% for the full sample. This shows the existence of exposure bias. The size of social network, linkage with relatives and extension agents influence farmers' decision to join FBSc and thus, the presence of endogenous effects of social networks. Thus, participation decision is more likely to be affected by characters and structure of social network. Access to off-farm income and perception on profit influences farmer participation decision where weather-indexed seed insurance can service as an effective strategy to ensure sustained membership. Therefore, any intervention in promotion of FBSc should consider the characters' and structure of social network and emphasis on indexed-based seed insurance and climate information services as strategy to promote seed producers cooperatives.

TI  - Fair Trade Rooibos tea: Connecting South African producers and American consumer markets
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - This article analyzes the recent growth and configuration of Fair Trade networks connecting South African Rooibos tea producers with American consumer markets. As we demonstrate, Fair Trade's growth in the Rooibos sector engages key issues of black empowerment, land reform, and sustainable development in post-Apartheid South Africa. Fair Trade networks provide small-scale black Rooibos producers with critical markets. Most significantly, the Wupperthal and Heiveld cooperatives have upgraded into processing and packaging and their jointly owned Fairpackers facility now exports shelf-ready Rooibos tea. Analyzing the nature of US Fair Trade Rooibos buyers and their South African sourcing arrangements, we identify key variations in Fair Trade commitment and engagement between mission-driven and market-driven distributors. While mission-driven buyers engage small-scale Rooibos cooperatives in multifaceted partnership networks, market-driven buyers pursue conventional sourcing strategies favoring purchases from large plantations and exporters. We conclude that tensions between a radical and commercial orientation toward Fair Trade in Rooibos tea networks in many ways mirror those in the broader movement. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Social capital influences farmer participation in collective irrigation management in Shaanxi Province, China
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of four components of social capital on farmers' participative behaviour in collective actions for constructing and operating small-scale groundwater irrigation systems on the Guanzhong Plain, Shaanxi Province, China.
   Design/methodology/approach - The four components (social networks, social trust, social reciprocity and social participation) were derived by employing exploratory factor analysis. Logistic model was used to estimate the influence of these components on farmers' participative behaviour. Information was obtained from a field survey covering six counties in 2011 of Shaanxi Province, China.
   Findings - The findings indicate that considering different components of social capital allows for a better understanding of farmers' participative behaviour. The authors find that higher levels of social trust and social participation lead to a higher propensity for collective action, while social reciprocity reduces the probability of participation. Other socio-economic factors and farming characteristics such as education levels, cultivated area, cropping patterns and grain subsidies also have a significant impact.
   Practical implications - The findings suggest creating favourable conditions for communication and information exchanges between households, which enhance their trust of each other, and encourage farmers to participate in collective affairs. Moreover, supportive rules are necessary for the future development of collective action. The results of this study also have implications for national irrigation plans for small-scale irrigation facilities in other developing countries.
   Originality/value - A consideration of the different components of social capital allows for a more precise understanding of farmers' participative behaviour.

TI  - Aceh and Nias, Indonesia post-tsunami reconstruction by survivor participation
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-FORENSIC ENGINEERING
AB  - The earthquake of 26 December 2004 off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, resulted in a tsunami that killed some 300 000 people and damaged farmland and irrigation systems and hence the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. A further earthquake on 28 March 2005 killed 1000 people in Nias and damaged irrigation systems throughout the island. In August 2005, a design team was engaged by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to assist the Indonesian government's Bureau of Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (BRR) to re-establish the irrigation infrastructure and management as a component of the ADB-grant-funded Earthquake and Tsunami Emergency Support Project. A participatory approach was taken by the design team through planning to construction by empowering survivors to form water user associations (WUAs), involving them in the planning process, training them in construction techniques and, through WUA-managed contracts, supporting them to rebuild their secondary and tertiary systems. During the project, the design engineers followed the BRR policy of 'building back better' by incorporating earthquake-resistant design in the higher-risk areas. This paper describes the participatory approach taken to restore some 93 irrigation systems over some 60 000 ha.

TI  - Understanding contracts in evolving agro-economies: Fermers, dekhqans and networks in Khorezm, Uzbekistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - We combine institutional economic perspectives and actor-network theory to elucidate the role of contracts in the evolution of transitional agricultural systems. Such combination of theories can shed a light on the mutual constitution of actors and institutions, and the formation of economic strategies. We argue that forms and functions of contracts can only be understood in an evolutionary context. In a case study of the Khorezm region, Uzbekistan, where several waves of reform created two principal actors - commercial farms (called fermers locally) responsible for state-ordered production and semi-subsistence smallholders (called dekhqans locally) - it is demonstrated how in the self-transformation of the actor-network, and thus the shifts in forms and roles of contracts, several network features play a role: interdependencies between the actors, the essential actant of the irrigation and drainage system, formal/informal dialectics. Time horizons, risk/benefit calculations, trust and cooperation forms emerge in the self-reproducing network and leave space for certain contractual forms and functions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The Role of Cooperatives in Brazilian Agricultural Production
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Much of the established literature on agricultural cooperatives describes their myriad contributions to farmers' economic performance. In Brazil, one of the world's leading agricultural exporters, there were more than 1500 agricultural cooperatives with 1 million members in 2020, and in 2017, 11% of all Brazilian farms were associated with one of these cooperatives. In this paper, we estimate the factors associated with the municipality share of cooperative membership (MSCM) and how municipality-level production value changes with MSCM. Our analysis is at the municipality level using aggregate data from the 2017 Agricultural Census. We find that in Brazil, higher education and smaller property sizes are associated with membership in agricultural cooperatives. To estimate how MSCM is associated with farm profits, we use a generalized propensity score and find that an increase in MSCM increases net municipal farm income, driven mostly by an increase in the value of agricultural production compared to a smaller increase in the cost of production.

TI  - Using the Auction Price Method to Estimate Payment for Forest Ecosystem Services in Xin'an River Basin in China: A BDM Approach
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Accurately estimating the forest farmers' protection costs for forest ecosystem services has become a hot issue in ecological economics. In this research, we propose a novel method of using an auction price model to evaluate the forest ecosystem services. We establish a functional relationship between forest farmers and the forestland that belongs to them based on experimental data from Xin'an River Basin in China. The results indicate that the average willingness of farmers to accept payment for forest ecosystem service protection in the low, middle, and high levels of forest quality is 17,123.10, 23,493.75, and 31,064.40 yuan/ha/year, respectively. Moreover, farmers with different individual characteristics, household characteristics, planting characteristics, policy cognition, and ecological awareness are also willing to be paid differently. This research can provide a reference for forest ecosystem protection policies and assist the sustainable forestry development.

TI  - Local farmer groups and collective action within fast track land reform in Zimbabwe
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - Fast track land reform led to the restructuring of agrarian relations in Zimbabwe. This paper explores the emerging forms of local agency on selected A1 farms in Goromonzi and Zvimba. It analyses how A1 beneficiaries have formed local farmer groups (LFGs) and the extent to which these have contributed towards relieving farm production challenges that include the unavailability of productive assets, limited household labour and unavailability of inputs. Through case studies of local farmer groups this paper manages to examine the internal dynamics of local agency, the nature of participation and the extent to which these formations actually provide a relief to members and provide the first line of defence of the newly found land rights. The findings provide important clues regarding local agency in a context where lineage forms of organisation do not exist and in most cases 'strangers' from different places have been resettled next to each other.

TI  - Effects of local farm management on wild bees through temporal and spatial spillovers: evidence from Southern India
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - Context The agricultural landscape in many low- and middle-income countries is characterized by smallholder management systems, often dependent on ecosystem services, such as pollination by wild pollinator populations. Increased adoption of modern inputs (e.g., agrochemicals) may threaten pollinators and smallholder crop production. Objective We aimed to identify the link between the use of agrochemicals and wild bee populations in Southern India, while explicitly considering the effects of temporal and spatial scaling. Methods For our empirical analysis, we combined data from pan trap samples and a farm management survey of 127 agricultural plots around Bangalore, India. We implemented a Poisson generalized linear model to analyze factors that influence bee abundance and richness with a particular focus on the present, past, and neighboring management decisions of farmers with respect to chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation. Results Our results suggest that agricultural intensification is associated with a decrease in the abundance and richness of wild bees in our study areas. Both time and space play an important role in explaining farm-bee interactions. We find statistically significant negative spillovers from pesticide use. Smallholders' use of chemical fertilizers and irrigation on their own plots significantly decreases the abundance of bees. Intensive past management reduces both bee abundance and richness. Conclusions Our results suggest that cooperative behavior among farmers and/or the regulation of agrochemical use is crucial to moderate spatial spillovers of farm management decisions. Furthermore, a rotation of extensive and intensive management could mitigate negative effects.

TI  - Allocating agricultural production factors: A scenario-based modeling of wheat production in Shandong Province, China
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
AB  - We aim to determine the effects of agricultural factors input per hectare on wheat production, and to optimize the allocation of wheat production factors under three scenarios and in different operating modes. Data were collected from 204 farming households using a face-to-face questionnaire. The sampled farms were selected through a stratified random sampling technique. We find fertilizer cost, irrigation cost and machinery cost all positively and significantly affect the per-unit-area wheat production, indicating the labor cost is not the major driving factor on wheat yield increment. Multi-object optimization model is used to allocate the production factors per hectare. We find under the Business as usual (BAU) scenario, the irrigation cost per-hectare wheat production after optimization in 2014 grows at a rate of 24.31% and accounts for 14.9% of total input. Under the Cooperate Environmental Sustain ability (CES) scenario, the fertilizer and pesticide costs after optimization drop significantly by 42.83% and 21.41%, respectively. Under the Rapid Benefit Growth (RBG) scenario, the irrigation cost after optimization increase by 2.56% and the fertilizer cost increases by 4.69% compared with the surveyed data. Comparison of optimized data among three operating modes shows that the labor costs at household farm and cooperative farm both increase significantly. Cooperative farms are more successful in production factor use efficiency and economic performance. In conclusion, wheat production at different operating modes could be improved so as to constitute more efficient and economic use of production factors. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Heterogeneous information exposure and technology adoption: the case of tissue culture bananas in Kenya
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Classical innovation adoption models implicitly assume homogenous information flow across farmers, which is often not realistic. As a result, selection bias in adoption parameters may occur. We focus on tissue culture (TC) banana technology that was introduced in Kenya more than 10 years ago. Up till now, adoption rates have remained relatively low. We employ the average treatment effects approach to account for selection bias and extend it by explicitly differentiating between awareness exposure (having heard of a technology) and knowledge exposure (understanding the attributes of a technology). Using a sample of Kenyan banana farmers, we find that estimated adoption parameters differ little when comparing the classical adoption model with one that corrects for heterogeneous awareness exposure. However, parameters differ considerably when accounting for heterogeneous knowledge exposure. This is plausible: while many farmers have heard about TC technology, its successful use requires notable changes in cultivation practices, and proper understanding is not yet very widespread. These results are also important for other technologies that are knowledge-intensive and require considerable adjustments in traditional practices.

TI  - Collaborative Leadership, Collective Action, and Community Governance against Public Health Crises under Uncertainty: A Case Study of the Quanjingwan Community in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - In the face of a public health crisis full of uncertainty, how should the community respond in order to effectively reduce the negative impact of the epidemic on public health? This article takes a Chinese rural community located near Wuhan City as an example to explore the mechanism of how collaborative leadership enhanced collective action in community governance against the COVID-19 pandemic. Early blockading to prevent transmission into the community, strict maintenance of social distance to prevent internal diffusion, timely elimination of public panic, and efficient guarantees of household supplies have proven effective in preventing the spread of the epidemic. Our research shows that collaborative leadership can achieve these goals mainly by effectively integrated local knowledge, modern information technology, and social self-organization, and then promoting the realization of collective action of community epidemic prevention and control. The lessons and implications for public health are discussed.

TI  - Assessing Farmers' Willingness to Participate in Campaign-Based Watershed Management: Experiences from Boset District, Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study assessed farmers' perceptions of the outcomes of the Campaign-Based Watershed Management (CBWM) program in Ethiopia, and how this influences their willingness to participate in the program. Key informant interviews, a household survey, and the Google Earth Engine were used to collect and analyze the relevant data. Results show that farmers' perceived outcomes of the CBWM program hardly motivated them to participate in the program. Particularly, farmers were not motivated by the physical effects of the program, because of the limited direct benefits to individual households, and destruction of previously developed micro-watersheds by frequent runoff and human and animal disturbances. Similarly, farmers were not motivated by the economic effects of the program, because of the limitations/absence of benefit-sharing mechanisms and resultant conflicts among farmers. The only motivating outcome of the program concerned its effect on personal capacities, which was particularly appreciated in localities that were vulnerable to erosion. The results of the study suggest the need to (1) better integrate actions at watershed level to come to effective water runoff control, (2) enhance the participation of all local actors to come to more effective area closure initiatives with transparent benefit-sharing mechanisms, and (3) give much more emphasis to capacity building as a cross-cutting component in the program. Hence, in order to enhance the willingness of farmers to genuinely participate in the CBWM, the program should adopt a more participatory and integrated approach.

TI  - Impact of institutional credit on agricultural productivity in India: A time series analysis
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB  - The institutional credit has always been perceived as a critical factor for agricultural development in India through complementing working capital, easing liquidity and investment constraints. The present study has examined the trends and regional variations in institutional credit flow to agriculture in India for the period 1991-92 to 2016-17 using compound annual growth rate. Further, impact of institutional credit on agricultural productivity was also assessed using panel data regression. The study is based on the secondary data collected from various published sources. Results indicated that institutional credit to agriculture in real terms has registered a significant positive growth during the past four decades and the highest annual growth was observed during 2001-02 to 2010-11. Scheduled commercial banks have emerged as the dominant source of agricultural credit. However, cooperative banks are still the major sources of production credit. Regional analysis showed that southern states had access to highest production and investment credit per hectare, while eastern and northeastern states had the least credit outreach per hectare. Panel data regression model testified that institutional credit has a significant and positive impact on agricultural productivity. Therefore, the study has suggested for better access to credit of smallholders especially in eastern, western and north eastern states through simplification of procedures.

TI  - Family Doctor Contract Services and Awareness of Blood Pressure Measurement Among Hypertension Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study in Rural Shandong, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundSome studies found that family doctor contract services (FDCSs) had positive impact on the self-measurement behaviors of hypertension patients. However, evidence concerning the association between FDCSs and blood pressure measurement awareness among hypertension patients is not clear. ObjectiveThis study aims to explore the relationship between FDCSs and blood pressure measurement awareness among the hypertension patients, and examine whether there is a difference in this relationship among middle-aged and aged adults in rural Shandong, China. MethodsA multi-stage stratified random sampling was adopted in 2018 in Shandong Province to conduct a questionnaire survey among the sample residents, in which 982 hypertension patients were included in the study. Pearson chi-square test and logistic regression model were employed using SPSS 24.0 to explore the association between FDCSs and blood pressure measurement awareness. Results76.8% of hypertension patients would measure blood pressure regularly. The blood pressure measurement awareness of the signing group was significantly higher than that of the non-signing group when controlling other variables (P < 0.001, OR = 2.075, 95% CI 1.391-3.095). The interaction of age and contracting status were significantly correlated with blood pressure measurement awareness (P = 0.042, OR = 1.747, 95% CI 1.020-2.992; P = 0.019, OR = 2.060, 95% CI 1.129-3.759). Factors including gender (P = 0.011, OR = 0.499, 95% CI 0.291-0.855), household income (P = 0.031, OR = 1.764, 95% CI 1.052-2.956), smoking status (P = 0.002, OR = 0.439, 95% CI 0.260-0.739), sports habits (P < 0.001, OR = 2.338, 95% CI 1.679-3.257), self-reported health (P = 0.031, OR = 1.608, 95% CI 1.043-2.477), distance to the village clinic (P = 0.006, OR = 1.952, 95% CI 1.208-3.153) and medications (P < 0.001, OR = 3.345, 95% CI 2.282-4.904) were also found to be associated with the blood pressure measurement awareness of hypertension patients. ConclusionThe government should take efforts to strengthen publicity and education of family doctors and pay more attention to uncontracted, middle-aged, female patients and patients with unhealthy life behaviors to improve the blood pressure measurement awareness.

TI  - Amblyomma hebraeum is the predominant tick species on goats in the Mnisi Community Area of Mpumalanga Province South Africa and is co-infected with Ehrlichia ruminantium and Rickettsia africae
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
AB  - BackgroundIn sub-Saharan Africa, Amblyomma ticks are vectors of heartwater disease in domestic ruminants, caused by the rickettsial pathogen Ehrlichia ruminantium. Immature tick stages often bite humans, whereby they act as vectors of tick-bite fever caused by Rickettsia africae. Moreover, Amblyomma ticks cause damage to livestock due to their feeding behaviour. In South Africa, we studied the abundance of Amblyomma hebraeum ticks on goats of emerging farmers in Mpumalanga Province. A selected number of A. hebraeum nymphs and adult ticks was tested for co-infection with E. ruminantium and R. africae.MethodsA total of 630 indigenous goats, belonging to farmers in the Mnisi Community area, were examined for ticks in 2013 and 2014. All ticks were identified, and a selected number was tested by PCR with reverse line blot hybridisation.ResultsIn total, 13,132 ticks were collected from goats distributed over 17 different households. Amblyomma hebraeum was the predominant species, followed by R. microplus. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, R. simus and R. zambeziensis were also identified. Amblyomma hebraeum was present throughout the year, with peak activity of adults in summer (November) and nymphs in winter (July). The ratio between adults and nymphs ranged from 1:2.7 in summer to 1:55.1 in winter. The mean prevalence of infection for E. ruminantium by PCR/RLB in adult ticks was 17.4% (31/178), whereas 15.7% (28/178) were infected with R. africae. In pooled nymphs, 28.4% were infected with E. ruminantium and 38.8% carried R. africae infection. Co-infections of E. ruminantium and R. africae in adult and pooled nymphal ticks were 3.9% (7/178) and 10% (14.9), respectively. Lameness of goats due to predilection of ticks for the interdigital space of their feet was observed in 89% of the households.ConclusionsGoats act as important alternative hosts for cattle ticks, which underscored the necessity to include goats in control programs. It is suggested to use acaricide-impregnated leg-bands as a sustainable method to kill ticks and prevent lameness in goats. The challenge of goats by considerable numbers of E. ruminantium-infected ticks is a major obstacle for upgrading the indigenous goat breeds. Humans may be at risk to contract tick-bite fever in this area.

TI  - Development of down-flow hanging sponge - slow sand filter system as water purification system: Infection risk reduction in an East Africa rural area
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB  - Worldwide, many people still drink unpurified water, putting them at risk of contracting waterborne diseases such as diarrhea. In this study, an interview survey was conducted to evaluate the infection risk from the current water supply in rural areas in Kenya. According to the interview, the residents living in areas with no public water supply drink water from various sources such as surface water, spring water, dug well, rainwater, tap water, and water sold by nearby non-governmental organizations. Further, most of the respondents usually drink unpurified water, which generated a high infection risk value of 0.77 owing to inadequate water storage management. A new self-sustaining water purification process, which is a combination of a down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) reactor kind of biological trickling filter and a slow sand filter (SSF) with a 500 W solar was installed in an area with no public electricity and water supply. The DHS-SSF system efficiently decreased the total organic carbon, color, and turbidity by over 80% after the two-week operation, and the treated water could be used for household water. In addition, a survey for infection risk evaluation was conducted to determine the utility of the DHS-SSF system. However, drinking water supplied by the DHS-SSF system could reduce the infection risk of diarrhea by up to 99.5%. This result indicates that the DHS-SSF system could be an appropriate water purification system in no public water supply area. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Social relations, public interventions and land rent deviation: Evidence from Jiangsu Province in China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The price mechanism plays an important role in allocating resources and enhancing economic efficiency and equity of land markets. In this paper, we examine the impacts of social relations between rental partners and public interventions imposed by local governments or village collectives on land rent deviation and discuss efficiency and equity impacts as well. Household-level data collected in 2014 covering 907 households in 30 villages in Jiangsu Province, China, are used for empirical analysis. We find that social relations based on blood ties and geographical location increase the levels of land rent deviation and lead to a loss of efficiency and equity of the segmented land rental market. However, public interventions, i.e., land use limitations, collective permission and collective organization, may contribute to reducing land rent deviation and improving the efficiency and equity of the market. Further evidence suggests that public interventions induce land rental transactions among partners other than relatives or familiar villagers.

TI  - Does Security of Land Operational Rights Matter for the Improvement of Agricultural Production Efficiency under the Collective Ownership in China?
T2  - CHINA & WORLD ECONOMY
AB  - Under the "separation of three rights" policy, the impact of security of land operational rights on agricultural production efficiency has attracted much attention in recent years. Data envelopment analysis and mediation effect analysis were applied to 888 family farms run by new-type agricultural operators from Songjiang to identify the mechanism of the effect of land operational rights security on agricultural production efficiency through long-term investment. The results show that greater security of land operational rights generally increased agricultural production efficiency. Approximately 37.94 percent of the impact could be explained by long-term investment. The results also indicate that significant heterogeneity exists in the effect of land operational rights security on agricultural production efficiency at various levels of the family farms' efficiency distributions. It is suggested that government should legalize land operational rights and give them a status equal to those of households' contractual rights and land ownership rights in China's future land tenure reform.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - The paper discusses India's agrarian crisis and the role of corporate-led contract farming in addressing these crisis. A two-stage Heckman model was used to explain determinants of participation in contract farming, and whether participation in contract farming affects farm income. The results indicate that contract farming has a positive impact on crop productivity and farm income. The socio-economic factors that influenced participation in contract farming were education, age, farm size, access to institutional credit, source of off-farm income and membership to an organization. Factors related to the likelihood of participation in contract farming slightly differed from the factors affecting farm income.

TI  - The Effect of Urban Shrinkage on Carbon Dioxide Emissions Efficiency in Northeast China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Climate change caused by CO2 emissions is a controversial topic in today's society; improving CO2 emission efficiency (CEE) is an important way to reduce carbon emissions. While studies have often focused on areas with high carbon and large economies, the areas with persistent contraction have been neglected. These regions do not have high carbon emissions, but are facing a continuous decline in energy efficiency; therefore, it is of great relevance to explore the impact and mechanisms of CO2 emission efficiency in shrinking areas or shrinking cities. This paper uses a super-efficiency slacks-based measure (SBM) model to measure the CO2 emission efficiency and potential CO2 emission reduction (PCR) of 33 prefecture-level cities in northeast China from 2006 to 2019. For the first time, a Tobit model is used to analyze the factors influencing CEE, using the level of urban shrinkage as the core variable, with socio-economic indicators and urban construction indicators as control variables, while the mediating effect model is applied to identify the transmission mechanism of urban shrinkage. The results show that the CEE index of cities in northeast China is decreasing by 1.75% per annum. For every 1% increase in urban shrinkage, CEE decreased by approximately 2.1458%, with urban shrinkage, industrial structure, and expansion intensity index (EII) being the main factors influencing CEE. At the same time, urban shrinkage has a further dampening effect on CEE by reducing research and development expenditure (R&D) and urban compactness (COMP), with each 1% increase in urban shrinkage reducing R&D and COMP by approximately 0.534% and 1.233%, respectively. This can be improved by making full use of the available built-up space, increasing urban density, and promoting investment in research.

TI  - State formation and water resources management in the Horn of Africa: the Aksumite Kingdom of the northern Ethiopian highlands
T2  - WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY
AB  - Intensification of agriculture and irrigation are often considered triggers for both the flourishing and demise of civilizations. Was irrigation a key factor of state formation and urban development in northern Ethiopia? We argue that a household-based management of farmland and water would have provided a strategy sustainable over the long term and flexible enough to adjust to population expansion and contraction at the ancient capital of the Kingdom of Aksum (first millennium ad). This conclusion is based on research into environmental, archaeological and historical data concerning the forms and use of water resources together with new information originating from geoarchaeological and palaeobotanical work in the Aksum area. The results indicate that the characteristics of the environment and traditional farming system are such that intensive irrigation works were not necessary. It appears likely that ancient Aksumites utilized seasonal rainfall and water conservation methods to sustain food production.

TI  - Exploring the relationship between local institutions in SAT India and adaptation to climate variability
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
AB  - This paper examines the relationship between local institutions and adaptation to climate variability in four semi-arid villages in India. Based on a qualitative survey, it draws attention to the constraints that farming households face, the role of institutions, and the implications for their capacities to adapt. Using an institutional framework, the study examines the role of local institutions in facilitating community adaptation to perceived climate variability. It was found that at the institutional and community level farmers rely on government schemes that provide social safety nets and the private sector such as moneylenders as sources of adaptation options regarding access to credit. Serious constraints emerged, however, in terms of adaptation to what may be a more challenging future. These constraints were further explored by means of grounded theory. The lack of collective feeling and action has hindered bargaining for better market prices and the development of alternate livelihood options. The need for better financial inclusion and access to more formal systems of finance is necessary to increase the overall adaptive capacity of households. During crisis situations or climatic shocks, the absence of these systems means the sale of household assets and resources especially among small and landless groups of farmers. Overall, rural households perceive that public, civic, and private institutions play a significant role in shielding them against the adverse effects of climate variability. The perceived importance of different institutions is, however, different across different categories of farmers, women, and labourers.

TI  - Agricultural cooperative membership and technical efficiency of apple farmers in China: An analysis accounting for selectivity bias
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - This study examines the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on technical efficiency (TE) of apple farmers in China. We make novel contributions to the literature by employing a recently developed selectivity corrected stochastic production frontier model with propensity score matching to address possible self-selection biases stemming from both observable and unobservable factors. The empirical results show that TE for co-operative members ranges from 79 to 86 per cent and that for non-members ranges from 74 to 84 per cent, depending on how biases are controlled. In addition, the efficiency levels of both members and non-members of cooperatives appear to be underestimated if the selectivity bias is not appropriately addressed. Our findings conclude that the average TE is consistently higher for cooperative members relative to their counterparts, highlighting the positive role of contemporary agricultural cooperatives in promoting efficient usage of production inputs.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This paper explores smallholder farmers' perceptions of and adaptations to water scarcity in an irrigated system in south-eastern Mexico. Data from 85 farmers in four communities were collected through semi-structured interviews. The results show that farmers' adaptations are stimulated by their perceptions of the causes and dynamics of water scarcity. Findings also reveal that differences in perceptions of, and adaptations to, water scarcity within communities are due to characteristics such as irrigation techniques, water intake location, productive systems and access to groundwater. This study recommends the implementation of policies based on local conditions to cope with water scarcity.

TI  - Avifauna diversity and anthropogenic threats of wetlands in South-Western Ethiopia
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate avifauna diversity and anthropogenic threats to wetlands in Sheka and Bench-Maji Zones. A total of 5 wetlands, 4 swamps and 1 artificial lake, were purposely selected. Avian diversity data were collected using point count method. Household surveys were undertaken to collect data on anthropogenic threats of wetlands. A total of 1,130 individuals of birds belonging to 28 families and 61 species were recorded. Species richness and diversity were higher in the wet season (51 species, H = 3.65) than the dry season (40 species, H = 3.37). The Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity Index (BC) revealed the three study sites were 78.77% dissimilar in species composition (BCijk = 0.7877) with a total number of 18 shared species. Chega-Gawussi wetlands and Chonkie-Shinke wetlands have 70.89% similarity with BC Dissimilarity Index value of 0.291. The study identified that drainage for farming practices, grass overexploitation and Eucalyptus plantations were the main threats to Chonke-Shinkie wetlands, and Lake Dembi has been threatened by sedimentation from the adjacent farmlands, waste disposal from the Mizan-Aman Municipality, coffee washing plantations, whereas Chega-Gawussi wetlands were affected by grass overexploitation and deforestation. Therefore, due attention and conservation actions are required from stakeholders for the protection of these ecosystems.

TI  - Determinants of Coffee Producer Market Outlet Choice in Gololcha District of Oromia Region, Ethiopia: A Multivariate Probit Regression Analysis
T2  - STUDIES IN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - The study was conducted in Gololcha District of Arsi Zone with the objective of identifying determinants of coffee producer market outlet choice. The primary data were collected through personal interviews from a total of 154 producers, using structured and semi-structured questionnaires. The multivariate probit model result indicated that the sex of the household head, level of education, means of transport ownership and access to information had positively influenced choice of wholesaler and negatively influenced choice of agent middle-men. Level of education was significantly and negatively related with agent middle-men, and significantly and positively influenced cooperatives' and wholesalers' channel choice. Enhancing institutional and infrastructural (transportation and extension) facilities is necessary to enable coffee producers to select efficient channels. In addition, the study recommends that steps be taken to establish and support multi-purpose coffee farmers' cooperatives - grow their membership, as this should increase farmers' income through marketing activities and supply of important inputs.

T2  - LIVING IN A CHEMICAL WORLD: FRAMING THE FUTURE IN LIGHT OF THE PAST
CP  - Conference on Framing the Future in Light of the Past - Living in a Chemical World
AB  - This article discusses administrative obstacles in China that hinder the full integration of the rural population into the mainstream of development during a period of rapid industrialization. The Chinese household registration only for urban residents with its golden contents of cradle-to-grave security has become a formidable stumbling block that perpetuates the status of rural migrants as second-class citizens in their own country. Rural migrant workers are excluded from certain types of jobs and are not eligible for many benefits that urbanites have, such as health, education, and unemployment protection. These workers must also pay a number of fees and work for lower minimum wages than the local residents. With a precarious legal existence in urban areas, they are easy prey to unscrupulous officials and employers. Because they are not allowed to form independent trade unions, their best option is to vote with their feet and leave the firms with the worst conditions; this is exactly what they did from 2004. Given this situation, the debate on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) took a new turn with not only non-governmental organizations (NGOs) pushing it but with a wider range of employers and, of late, Chinese officials promoting their version of CSR. In the campaign to promote minimum labor standards, the norms set down in the Social Accountability 8000 were included in the CSR, recognizing the right to free collective bargaining and free trade unions but were excluded in the Chinese version even though the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements recognized these rights.

TI  - Farm households' perception about sugarcane outgrowers' scheme: Empirical evidence around Wonji/Shoa Sugar Factory
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - The study assessed the perception of contract farm households about sugarcane outgrowers' scheme around the Wonji/Shoa sugar factory. The study utilized primary data collected from randomly selected samples of 200 members of sugarcane-producing farmers' cooperatives through a structured survey question-naire. Purposively selected ten KIIs and six FGDs were also conducted with contract farmers and stakeholders. The five-point Likert scale measurement was created and applied to measure the perception of respondents about the scheme on considered 26 attributes and analyzed through descriptive statistics. Results revealed that the overall perception of the respondent contract farm households about the scheme was unfavorable with a weighted mean/index score of '2.32' with a mixed perception index score on considered 26 attributes. The study discussed the policy implications of the findings. The main areas of concern are the payment system, the relationship of contract farmers with representatives (from the union, factory, and cooperatives), the income of contract farm households, the provision of services package (like free training, extension services, technical advice), the transparent and comprehensive contract terms and conditions, the provision of basic inputs and production services as per agreement (like adequate land preparation, infield irrigation), the effective and efficient legal framework system, additional support by third parties (on pre and post-harvest, production input provision, basic skill training, and etc.), and both parties should develop trust by having confidence on each other and not by acting opportunistically.

TI  - The agri-food system (re)configuration: the case study of an agroecological network in the Ecuadorian Andes
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - Social Ecological System (SES) research highlights the importance of understanding the potential of collective actions, among other factors, when it comes to influencing the transformative (re)configuration of agri-food systems in response to global change. Such a response may result in different desired outcomes for those actors who promote collective action, one such outcome being food sovereignty. In this study, we used an SES framework to describe the configuration of local agri-food systems in Andean Ecuador in order to understand which components of the SES interact, and how they support outcomes linked to five food sovereignty goals. Through a survey administered to mestizo and indigenous peasants, we analyze the key role played by the Agroecological Network of Loja (RAL) in transforming the local agri-food system through the implementation of a Participatory Guarantee System (PGS). This study demonstrates that participation in the RAL and PGS increases farmers' adoption of agroecological practices, as well as their independence from non-traditional food. Additionally, RAL lobbying with the municipality significantly increases households' on-farm income through access to local markets. Being part of indigenous communities also influences the configuration of the food system, increasing the participation in community work and access to credit and markets, thus positively affecting animal numbers, dairy production and income diversification. The complexity of the interactions described suggests that more research is needed to understand which key factors may foster or prevent the achieving of food sovereignty goals and promote household adaptation amid high uncertainty due to global change.

TI  - Evaluations of the Roles of Organizational Support, Organizational Norms and Organizational Learning for Adopting Environmentally Friendly Technologies: A Case of Kiwifruit Farmers' Cooperatives of Meixian, China
T2  - LAND
AB  - Environmentally friendly technologies have long been recognized as a widespread phenomenon working within the functions and performance of farms. Farmer's cooperative organization might profoundly foster the environmentally friendly technologies (EFT) and availing competitive advantage to the farmer. Illustrated by the natural-resource-based view of the farm (NRBV), this study examined the influence of organizational support, organizational norms, and organizational learning on adopting EFT and proposed a model quantifying the impacts of these approaches towards availing competitive capabilities (i.e., cost, quality, flexibility, and delivery). The framework is empirically endorsed by employing the partial least squares approach to structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with the help of a household survey from a spectrum of 292 farmers of 38 kiwifruit cooperatives of Meixian County, China, from August to September 2020. The findings demonstrate that organizational support, organizational norms, and organizational learning positively influence EFT. Moreover, the study found EFT positively impacts product cost, product quality, product delivery, and production flexibility. Interestingly, the relationship between the adoption of environmentally friendly technologies and the competitive capabilities of kiwifruit farmers of Meixian is positively significant. The study proposes several policy recommendations emphasizing the role of organizations in the form of farmer's cooperatives in boosting farmers to engage in proenvironmental behavior and, therefore, shifting the trends of future research directions on the adoption of environmentally friendly technologies.

TI  - How do Property Rights Affect Credit Restrictions? Evidence from China's Forest Right Mortgages
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - Taking China's recently developed Forest Right Mortgage System (FRMS) as an example, this paper examines the impact of the strength of farmers' property rights on the intensity of credit restrictions imposed by lenders. Using the forest right mortgage policy documents we collected from eight key forestry counties (cities) in China's southern collective forest regions and the corresponding data of 414 surveyed farmers in 24 villages, we quantify the exclusivity of farmers' forest property rights and the extent of FRMS credit restrictions in the sampled regions, and explore whether and how the strength of farmers' forest rights affect credit restrictions under FRMS. The results show that there exists a significant mediation effect of the forest rights exclusivity on credit restrictions intensity through its impact on the market value of forest rights. We further examine the relationship between each disaggregated forest right and the FRMS credit restrictions, and find that the strength of farmers' forestland use rights, transfer rights and benefit rights are all statistically significant in increasing the market value of farmers' forest right and thereby reducing the intensity of credit restrictions. Based on the analyses we also offer some policy suggestions.

TI  - Impacts of COVID-19 on Small-Scale Dairy Enterprises in an Indian Megacity-Insights from Greater Bengaluru
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Natural calamities and pandemics massively affect small-scale entrepreneurs. In this paper, we aim to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic affected small dairy farms in the megacity of Bengaluru, India, where they supply a high share of the milk demand. In 2020 a total of 129 farms were visited before the first lockdown (January to March) and interviewed again after the lockdown had been loosened (August to September). Questions addressed feed supply to dairy cows, milk yield and marketing, and coping strategies for lockdown impacts. Results showed that the share of farmers not feeding concentrates increased from 1% before lockdown to 7% afterward (p < 0.05), and those not offering dry forages increased from 20% to 33% (p < 0.05) due to increasing forage prices. Milk yield dropped in all surveyed farms from 3905 L before to 2861 L after lockdown (p < 0.05) due to the sale of 30% of lactating cows across the farms. Enabling farmers to better cope with shocks through feed storage and by processing their surplus milk into durable products should be prioritised by supporting institutions such as dairy cooperatives. Alternatively, insurance schemes can capacitate farmers to maintain a fresh milk supply to urban consumers in the wake of global challenges.

TI  - Heterogeneity of wetland landscapes and their relationships with anthropogenic disturbances and precipitation in a semiarid region of China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - Wetlands in semiarid regions have important ecological functions and provide services that are partly dependent on the landscape pattern and structure; therefore, it is important to assess the heterogeneity of wetland landscape conditions for wetland conservation and management. Widespread wetland degradation resulting from main factors in semiarid regions highlights the need for exploring the heterogeneity of wetland landscapes and their relationships with anthropogenic disturbances and precipitation. Wetlands in our study referred to natural wetlands, including marshes, rivers, and lakes. We used overall landscape metrics to assess wetland landscape conditions and used grid landscape metrics at a scale of 30 km using a moving window method to explore the heterogeneity of wetland landscapes during the period (1986-2019) for western Jilin Province. We performed Spearman correlation analyses of the landscape metrics with the Hemeroby index (HI) and mean annual precipitation (MAP). We suggested that wetland landscape composition metrics (e.g., NP and PD) and configuration metrics (e.g., ED and AI) had positive correlations with HI by 2019 (p < 0.01); in addition, wetland landscape composition metrics (e.g., NP and PD) and configuration metrics (e.g., ED) were negatively correlated with MAP during 1986-2019. In conclusion, wetland landscapes have become increasingly fragmented over the past few decades (1986-2019) in western Jilin Province and the reasons for this result mainly include the household contract responsibility system, along with rural productivity, severe overgrazing and reclamation, and climate change. Wetland landscape composition was positively correlated with human interference and negatively correlated with mean annual precipitation.

TI  - Dynamics of Coffee Certifications in Producer Countries: Re-Examining the Tanzanian Status, Challenges and Impacts on Livelihoods and Environmental Conservation
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Certification is increasingly becoming necessary for accessing coffee export markets and practicing environmental conservation, especially at this time when many of the farmers in developing countries strive to achieve agricultural transformation. Using data from 400 randomly selected coffee farmers in Tanzania, the study determined the status, constraints, key drivers, and impact of coffee certifications. Descriptive statistics and the endogenous switching regression (ESR) model were used for data analysis. Results indicated that the level of coffee certification is low, being constrained by unawareness and inaccessibility, the prevalence of coffee diseases, failure in realizing price advantages, and certification not being cost effective. Economies of scale, experience, and participation in collective actions are significant factors affecting coffee farmers' decision to join certification schemes. Additionally, the study rejects the hypothesis of certification to improve household income. However, certification improved awareness and practices of environmental conservation among coffee farmers. It is thus important to embark on awareness creation and make certification services accessible and cost effective to coffee farmers for increased access to niche export markets. Easing transmission of price premiums to coffee farmers will also increase the supply of sustainably grown coffee, improve coffee farmers' livelihood, and help in the attainment of environmental sustainability goals within the coffee supply chain.

TI  - Typology of vulnerability of wheat farmers in Northeast Iran and implications for their adaptive capacity
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study is focused on understanding sources and patterns of vulnerability of wheat smallholder farmers in Northeast Iran. We conducted a farm household survey and recorded multiple environmental and socio-economic attributes of 391 wheat smallholder farmers. A Vulnerability Scoping Diagram and Principal Component Analysis served to identify key factors determining wheat farmer's vulnerability. Also, we performed a cluster analysis to classify wheat farmers into three vulnerability types. Although drought affects all types as main environmental stressor, only for Cluster 2 was it the key vulnerability factor. For Clusters 1 and 3 socio-economic vulnerability components prevailed: for farmers categorized in Cluster 1 land consolidation was the main problem, while the current wheat import policy was the key problem for Cluster 3 farmers. Multiple tailored policies are needed that reduce the vulnerability of wheat farmers in all clusters. Supportive government policies should for example focus on avoiding price distortions from wheat imports for Cluster 3, land consolidation for Cluster 1 and collective tackling of pests and weeds for Cluster 2. Simultaneous provision of farm advisory services will benefit farmers of Clusters 1 and 3, while availability of improved seeds (drought-tolerant varieties) and other inputs will lower the environmental vulnerability of all farmers.

TI  - Strengthening understanding and perceptions of mineral fertilizer use among smallholder farmers: evidence from collective trials in western Kenya
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - It is widely recognized that mineral fertilizers must play an important part in improving agricultural productivity in western Kenyan farming systems. This paper suggests that for this goal to be realized, farmers' knowledge must be strengthened to improve their understanding of fertilizers and their use. We analyzed smallholder knowledge of fertilizers and nutrient management, and draw practical lessons from empirical collective fertilizer-response experiments. Data were gathered from the collective fertilizer-response trials, through focus group discussions, by participant observation, and via in-depth interviews representing 40 households. The collective trials showed that the application of nitrogen (N) or phosphorous (P) alone was insufficient to enhance yields in the study area. The response to P on the trial plots was mainly influenced by incidences of the parasitic Striga weed, by spatial variability or gradients in soil fertility of the experimental plots, and by interactions with N levels. These results inspired farmer to design and conduct experiments to compare crop performance with and without fertilizer, and between types of fertilizers, or responses on different soils. Participating farmers were able to differentiate types of fertilizer, and understood rates of application and the roles of respective fertilizers in nutrient supply. However, notions were broadly generated by unsteady yield responses when fertilizers were used across different fertility gradients, association with high cost (especially if recommended rates were to be applied), association of fertilizer use with hybrids and certain crops, historical factors, among other main aspects. We identified that strengthening fertilizer knowledge must be tailored within existing, albeit imperfect, systems of crop and animal husbandry. Farmers' perceptions cannot be changed by promoting more fertilizer use alone, but may require a more basic approach that, for example, encourages farmer experimentation and practices to enhance soil properties such as carbon build-up in impoverished local soils.

TI  - Incentivizing household forest management in China's forest reform: Limitations to rights-based approaches in Southwest China
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - On the basis that property rights provide effective incentives to their users, rights-based approaches have become well-received for purposes of improved resource management, production, and conservation. Recent reform in China's collective-owned forest sector has also been guided by a rights-based approach in generating new incentives and economic benefits for households. Forest property rights have been reconfigured into formal, private, and transferable form, and households are financially compensated for rights' attenuation. In this paper, we draw on a household survey (N = 331) and a series of interviews (N = 29) to empirically examine how three types of forest rights are exercised and perceived by rural households in the Wuling Mountain Area, a relatively poor and mountainous area in Southwest China. Our findings show that although the new rights arrangements are largely perceived as credible by households, the rights are rarely exercised, without tangible contributions to the intended benefits. In explaining this, we find that current economic values of household forests are low. This may suggest that rights-based approaches are unlikely to realize their intended effects if the natural resources themselves are of too little value, an oversight in conventional discussions on resource rights.

TI  - Can producer groups improve technical efficiency among artisanal shrimpers in Nigeria? A study accounting for observed and unobserved selectivity
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD ECONOMICS
AB  - It is widely recognized that participation in producer groups is advantageous for smallholders who must deal with complex production and marketing constraints and dynamic business environments. However, available data on this process are scarce in the fishery sector, while existing evidence is limited by smallholders' potential self-selection into producer groups. This study, therefore, examined the selectivity-corrected role of fisher groups in improving shrimpers' technological and technical efficiency. Using the latest primary data from artisan shrimpers in Nigeria, we applied propensity score matching and Greene's selectivity stochastic production frontier model to control for selection bias from both observable and unobservable factors. Empirical results from our metafrontier approach show that technical efficiency scores for members tend to be overestimated if selectivity is not properly controlled. However, the technical efficiencies and productivities of members were significantly higher regardless of how biases were corrected, implying that participation in fisher groups is positively related to increases in shrimpers' capture and technical efficiency. Further findings suggest that current artisanal fisher groups are "production-oriented" as they ensure that members access vital shrimping inputs at lower costs. With declining returns to scale for members, the study concludes that without public and private support for collective action in the fishery sector, membership in artisanal fisher groups may not lead to significant improvement in shrimpers' productivity. The study discusses several recommendations on how collective action can be further encouraged and developed among artisan fishers.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variations of soil nutrients influenced by an altered land tenure system in China
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Initiated during the late 1970s in China, the Household Responsibility System (HRS) has brought a profound change to the rural economy. The shift from a collective farming system to individually-owned family farms has changed land management practices, affecting both soil quality and agro-environmental sustainability. The purpose of this study was to investigate spatio-temporal variability of soil nutrients influenced by the altered land tenure system, and to evaluate the potential for site-specific management. Using geostatistics and GIS, we characterized the spatial variability of soil nutrients in paddy rice fields in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou watershed, China, following 20 years of altered land management policy. Soil samples, collected in 1982 and 2001, were analyzed for soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK). The spatial variability of each of these soil properties decreased from 1982 to 2001, verifying that the extrinsic factors of the altered land management practices had a weakening effect on the intrinsic factors of soil formation properties. Spatial correlation ranges for SOM, TN, and AP in 2001 all decreased from 1982 with the exception of AK. Temporal geographic maps revealed significant changes in soil nutrient concentrations in the form of increases in SOM, TN, and AP and a sharp decline of AK during the period 1982-2001. This result gave an indication of the imbalance among N, P. and K fertilizers applied in the study area. The results of the comprehensive assessment for current soil nutrients could also, inversely, present challenges for future site-specific management policy on agriculture. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Analysis of resource use efficiency for white cumin production among smallholder farmers empirical evidence from Northwestern Ethiopia: a stochastic frontier approach
T2  - LETTERS IN SPATIAL AND RESOURCE SCIENCES
AB  - Cumin is a flowering plant and the second Ethiopian export spice crop next to ginger. The area coverage, as well as the production of white cumin, is increasing year to year. However, there is a growing gap between white cumin demand and supply in Ethiopia due to its low production and productivity of white cumin. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate factors affecting the technical inefficiency of white cumin production among smallholder producers in Northwestern Ethiopia. A Semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect the primary data from 228 white cumin producers, who were selected by using a systematic random sampling technique. Moreover, a combination of data analysis methods such as descriptive statistics and the stochastic Cobb-Douglas production frontier model was used to analyze the collected data. The empirical result of the study showed that the mean technical efficiency of white cumin production was 81%. This implies that white cumin producers can boost white cumin output by 19% using the existing level of inputs and technology. The maximum likelihood estimates of the stochastic production model revealed that land, Nitrogen-Phosphate and Sulphate, and urea were statistically and positively affected the production level of white cumin. The positive effect indicates that the lack of these inputs would hamper the production of white cumin. Moreover, the maximum likelihood estimate of the stochastic frontier model coupled with the inefficiency parameters indicated that the age of household head, tropical livestock unit, land fragmentation, and membership of cooperatives were found to be statistically and negatively influence the level of technical inefficiency of white cumin producers, whereas family size, distance to the main road and credit access were found to be statistically and positively influence the level of technical inefficiency of white cumin producers. Hence, the study suggested that the government should strengthen farm cooperatives and construct roads near the residence of producers to improve their efficiency level. Moreover, the district experts should arrange an experience-sharing (which is a proxy variable for age) program to improve the efficiency level of less efficient producers by adopting the best practice of relatively efficient producers.

TI  - Trust, transaction costs, and contract enforcement: evidence from apple farmers in China
T2  - BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of trust and transaction costs on farmers' contract enforcement choices using cross-sectional data collected from apple farmers in China.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study employs ordered probit model in a two-stage regression procedure to conduct the empirical analysis.
   Findings - The empirical results show that trust and transactions costs significantly influence smallholders' contract enforcement choices. In particular, longer distance to collective place and delayed payment have negative and significant impacts on contract enforcement, while farmers' cognition trust has a positive and significant impact on contract enforcement. Factors such as education, distance to main road and price premium also tend to have positive and statistically significant impacts on contract enforcement choices.
   Originality/value - This study used first-hand survey data to examine the impact of transaction costs and trust using proxy variables on apple farmers' contract enforcement choices.

TI  - Multi-faceted impact and outcome of COVID-19 on smallholder agricultural systems: Integrating qualitative research and fuzzy cognitive mapping to explore resilient strategies
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - The shock of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disrupted food systems worldwide. Such disruption, affecting multiple systems interfaces in smallholder agriculture, is unprecedented and needs to be understood from multi-stakeholder perspectives. The multiple loops of causality in the pathways of impact renders the system outcomes unpredictable. Understanding the nature of such unpredictable pathways is critical to identify present and future systems intervention strategies. Our study aims to explore the multiple pathways of present and future impact created by the pandemic and ?Amphan? cyclonic storm on smallholder agricultural systems. Also, we anticipate the behaviour of the systems elements under different realistic scenarios of intervention. We explored the severity and multi-faceted impacts of the pandemic on vulnerable smallholder agricultural production systems through in-depth interactions with key players at the micro-level. It provided contextual information, and revealed critical insights to understand the cascading effect of the pandemic and the cyclone on farm households. We employed thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with multiple stakeholders in Sundarbans areas in eastern India, to identify the present and future systems outcomes caused by the pandemic, and later compounded by ?Amphan?. The immediate adaptation strategies of the farmers were engaging family labors, exchanging labors with neighbouring farmers, borrowing money from relatives, accessing free food rations, replacing dead livestock, early harvesting, and reclamation of waterbodies. The thematic analysis identified several systems elements, such as harvesting, marketing, labor accessibility, among others, through which the impacts of the pandemic were expressed. Drawing on these outputs, we employed Mental Modeler, a Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Mapping tool, to develop multi-stakeholder mental models for the smallholder agricultural systems of the region. Analysis of the mental models indicated the centrality of ?Kharif? (monsoon) rice production, current farm income, and investment for the next crop cycle to determine the pathways and degree of the dual impact on farm households. Current household expenditure, livestock, and soil fertility were other central elements in the shared mental model. Scenario analysis with multiple stakeholders suggested enhanced market access and current household income, sustained investment in farming, rapid improvement in affected soil, irrigation water and livestock as the most effective strategies to enhance the resilience of farm families during and after the pandemic. This study may help in formulating short and long-term intervention strategies in the post-pandemic communities, and the methodological approach can be used elsewhere to understand perturbed socioecological systems to formulate anticipatory intervention strategies based on collective wisdom of stakeholders.

TI  - Are social security policies for Chinese landless farmers really effective on health in the process of Chinese rapid urbanization? a study on the effect of social security policies for Chinese landless farmers on their health-related quality of life
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB  - Background: The continuing urbanization in China has resulted in a loss of land and rights among farmers. The social security of landless farmers has attracted considerable research attention. However, only few studies measure the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of landless farmers by employing scientific standardized scales. By using five-dimensional European quality of life (EQ-5D) scales, this study measures the HRQOL of landless farmers from a new perspective and examines how the social security policies affect their HRQOL.
   Methods: This study is based on a 2013 household survey that has been conducted among 1,500 landless famers who are residing in six resettlement areas in three cities within the Yangtze River Delta region, namely, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Yangzhou. This study adopts EQ-5D scales to measure the HRQOL of these farmers. More than 50% of the respondents are in poor or non-serious health conditions, and over 50% are not satisfied with their current social security policies. The health conditions and social security policies are analyzed by multinomial regression analysis and the relationship between these two factors are analyzed via structural equation modeling (SEM).
   Results: First, the descriptive statistical analysis shows that more than 50% of the respondents are in poor or non-serious health conditions, and that the largest proportion of these farmers are suffering from anxiety or depression, which is the most serious of the five dimensions. Second, multinomial regression analysis shows that the satisfaction of landless farmers with their social security policies improves their living conditions, particularly in their capacity for self-care, in their ability to perform daily activities, and in the reduction of pain, anxiety, and depression. Third, SEM model analysis shows that the satisfaction of landless farmers with their social security policies positively influences their HRQOL. Among the five dimensions of EQ-5D, daily activities produce the greatest influence on the HRQOL of landless farmers. As regards social security policies, the land acquisition compensation policy and the employment security policy produce the greatest and weakest influences on the HRQOL of landless farmers, respectively.
   Conclusions: The rapid urbanization in China has deprived many farmers of their lands and of the benefits of urbanization. These farmers are often in a disadvantaged position in the land acquisition process. Statistic analysis in this paper shows that the satisfaction of landless farmers with their social security policies positively influences their HRQOL. The implementation and improvement of social security policies is very important for the long-term and sustainable development of these landless farmers.

TI  - Sustainable farming techniques and farm size for rice smallholders in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta: A slack-based technical efficiency approach
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Small farm size and fragmented land are considered constraining agricultural development. This study uses the Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey 2016 (VHLSS 2016) dataset to measure the technical efficiency of rice smallholders and its determinants, including farm size, in the Mekong Delta. Data envelopment analysis was employed to examine efficiency scores in the first stage based on data of 506 paddy farms. The overall efficiency calculated through slack-based measure was low at 0.59 and the input slacks were quite large. This indicated that local farmers have not been using their resources efficiently in producing paddy. Further, farms smaller than 2 ha faced low overall efficiency at 54% and higher slacks in terms of all input types. The second-stage Tobit result showed that all types of efficiency could be improved if farmers expanded their farm size and reduced the over-use of inputs. Thus, enabling small farms to achieve economies of scale through collective farming in the Large Field Model (LFM) will be critical for upgrading production efficiency and reducing slacks as labor costs rise and natural resources are constrained. It is recommended that farmers should follow strictly eco-friendly farming packages in order to reduce their current excessive usage of seed cost by 28 USD/ha, pesticides by 61 USD/ha, and fertilizers by 155 kg/ha to reach efficient production frontier. The government needs to take measures to replicate and closely monitor climate smart agriculture programs in large-scale production to improve the overall efficiency of paddy sector, in addition to the important goal of protecting the environment and natural resources of the region.Availability of data and materials: The VHLSS 2016 questionnaire section and dataset analyzed in this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

TI  - Use and perceptions of alternative economic activities among smallholder coffee farmers in Huehuetenango and El Quiche departments in Guatemala
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - In the past two decades, Mesoamerican smallholder coffee farmers have had to confront several stressors and shocks, such as price crises and natural disasters, with debilitating impacts on the viability of their livelihoods. More recently, many farmers have suffered crop losses in the wake of the spread of coffee leaf rust disease, and researchers are predicting that some areas will become less suitable for coffee growing in the near future as a result of climate change. For these reasons, many have called for the promotion of livelihood diversification as an additional component of rural development programs. This study uses thematic analysis of transcripts from 15 interviews with members of a regional Guatemalan coffee cooperative, Asociacion Barillense de Agricultores, based on four different interview guides. Coffee remains the primary livelihood strategy of the respondents, whereas most other activities appear to offer relatively small contributions to incomes, with the exception of honey and a small sewing shop. Some of the farmer responses reflect coping mechanisms rather than risk management. The study also identified other themes mediating diversification, including income-smoothing, optimization, familiarity, social networks, and influences from external actors.

TI  - Will Joining Cooperative Promote Farmers to Replace Chemical Fertilizers with Organic Fertilizers?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - This study examines whether cooperatives can assist more than 200 million farmers in China, who are facing tightening resources and environmental constraints, in adopting green farming practices. A framework for counterfactual analysis was established to quantify the impact of farmers joining cooperatives on the reduction in chemical fertilizer consumption and the use of organic fertilizers. The study's conclusions are based on data from 712 farmers in four counties in Shandong and Henan provinces. Joining a cooperative can have a positive impact on farmers' selection of environmentally friendly production methods, which increases the likelihood of farmers reducing chemical fertilizer application by 35.6% and organic fertilizer application by 22.0%. It can also reduce the cost of chemical fertilizer application by an average of $209.2/ha. The extent to which smallholder farmers use chemical and organic fertilizers after joining cooperatives depends on the size of their farming operations and their perception of green production.

TI  - Social adaptive responses to a harsh and unpredictable environment: insights from a pre-Hispanic andean society
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - The scarcity or unpredictability of natural resources is a threat to cooperation within human societies. Exacerbated competition between individuals could affect social cohesion and collective action, generate conflicts over natural resources, and compromise their sustainable use. Yet, our in-depth archaeological study of the arid Andean highlands of Bolivia reveals the sustainable development of a complex agrarian society in a harsh environment marked, moreover, by a prolonged climatic degradation from the 13th to the 15th centuries. The 49 community settlements studied comprised independent family households that managed their own economic resources. A detailed study of the granary and housing structures of 549 of these households provided a strong quantitative data set for an analysis of Gini coefficients for grain storage capacity and housing area. This agro-pastoral society flourished with neither notable inequalities of wealth between villagers nor apparent long-lasting conflicts between villages. By sharing local knowledge, labor, and natural resources, this society succeeded both in limiting power and wealth concentration, and in sustainably producing food surpluses to be exchanged with neighboring populations. These results indicate a high degree of social cohesion and low levels of social and wealth inequality, similar to other well-established horticultural and agricultural societies around the world. We propose a conceptual model of low inequality in agrarian societies subject to extreme or unstable environments, where the sharing of knowledge, resources, and labor are the adaptive social responses to cope with the uncertainty in natural resources. The sustainability of the society is then guaranteed by a balance between collective action and family-based social organization.

TI  - Time-Related Characteristics of Tenancy Contracts and Investment in Soil Conservation Practices
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - We present a dynamic model that shows how different types of land tenancy contracts and their time-related characteristics influence farmers' decisions to invest in soil improvement and productive inputs. Using recent household and plot-level data from the Brong-Ahafo Region in Ghana, we analyze the impact of land tenancy arrangements, contract duration, as well as the number of times the contract has been renewed in the past on the intensity of investment in soil conservation measures such as ditches and farmyard manure and productive inputs like chemical fertilizer. The empirical findings generally confirm the predictions of the theoretical model and reveal that the intensity of investments on different plots cultivated by a given farmer varies significantly with the type of tenancy arrangement on the plot as well as the time-related characteristics of the contract.

TI  - Effects of nucleus-farmer outgrower schemes on profitability among smallholder farmers: Empirical evidence from Northern Ghana
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - Nucleus farmer-outgrower schemes are contractual arrangements where a large farmer (nucleus farmer) who is well-resourced takes charge of smaller farmers by providing them with the necessary training on agronomic practices and some farm inputs for production. The study assesses the effects of nucleus farmer-outgrower schemes on profitability among smallholder farmers in Northern Ghana. A total of 330 smallholder farmers made up of 150 outgrowers and 180 non-outgrowers were interviewed using structured questionnaires. A comparative analysis is made between outgrowers and non-outgrowers. The study employs the binary logit regression model to identify the factors influencing participation in nucleus farmer-outgrower schemes and the propensity score matching technique to estimate the effect of nucleus farmer-outgrower schemes on profitability of smallholder farmers. The study reveals that the factors that significantly influence smallholder farmers' participation in nucleus farmer-outgrower schemes are gender, marital status, farm size, membership of an FBO and extension contact. Gender and marital status of a farmer have negative influence on participation whilst farm size, membership of an FBO and extension contact have positive influence on participation. It was also revealed that nucleus farmer-outgrower schemes have significant positive effect on smallholder farmer's gross margins, net margins and returns on investment. The study recommends that, nucleus farmers and other stakeholders who are involved in developing outgrower schemes or similar initiatives should take into consideration the social and demographic characteristics of the target farmers to enhance participation.

TI  - The Distribution of Residual Controls and Risk Sharing: A Case Study of Farmland Transfer in China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Structuring contracts to share interest and risk is the central premise of farmland transfer, yet the contract framework and its determinants have rarely been empirically tested based on micro-level data. In this study, we aim to examine factors underlying the balanced distribution of residual controls and risk sharing on contract framework by using field surveyed data of 353 individual farmland transfer contracts. Our evidence shows that the policy of farmland property rights registration has a significant effect on the contract framework and supports the implication of enforcement costs exerted by the effects of the scale ratio and the contract form, contract duration, conversion way, and long-lived assets input. Although our findings fail to support the typical implication of risk sharing as an explanation of contract framework of farmland transfer, given the symmetric positions of two contracted parties of rural farmer households, it is proved that right confirmation and contract duration are two important factors underlying contract options.

TI  - Energy budgeting and carbon footprint of different wheat-rice cropping systems in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Wheat-rice cropping system in China, characterized by smallholder with conventional practice, is energy- and carbonintensive. Cooperative with scientific practice is a promising practice to increase resource use while reducing environmental impact. However, comprehensive studies of the energy and carbon (C) budgeting of management practices on the actual field-scale production under different production types are lacking. The present research examined the energy and C budgeting of smallholder and cooperative using conventional practice (CP) or scientific practice (SP) at the field scale level in the Yangtze River Plain, China. The SPs and cooperatives exhibited 9.14 % and 6.85 % and 4.68 % and 2.49 % higher grain yields over the corresponding CPs and smallholders, respectively, while maintaining 48.44 % and 28.50 % and 38.81 % and 20.16 % higher net income. Compared to the CPs, the corresponding SPs reduced the total energy input by 10.35 % and 7.88 %, and the energy savings were primarily attributable to reductions in fertilizer, water, and seeds through the use of improved techniques. The total energy input in the cooperatives was 11.53 % and 9.09 % lower than that for the corresponding smallholders due to the mechanistic enhancements and improved operational efficiency. As a result of the increased yields and reduced energy inputs, the SPs and cooperatives ultimately increased energy use efficiency. The high productivity attributed to increased C output in the SPs, which increased C use efficiency and the C sustainability index (CSI) but decreased the C footprint (CF) over the corresponding CPs. The higher productivity and more efficient machinery of cooperatives increased the CSI and reduced the CF compared to the corresponding smallholders. Overall, the SPs coupled with cooperatives were the most energy efficient, C efficient, profitable and productive for wheat-rice cropping systems. In the future, improved fertilization management practices and integration of smallholder farms were effective means for developing sustain

TI  - Caught in a dilemma: why do non-smoking women in China support the smoking behaviors of men in their families?
T2  - HEALTH EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB  - Intimate relationships influence family members' health practices. Although cigarette smoking in China is predominantly a male behavior, (non-smoking) women's roles should be taken into account for the development of home-smoking interventions. Drawing on ethnographic interviews with 22 families in a rural area of China, this article explores non-smoking women's attitudes towards male smoking. The findings suggest that women's ability to influence male behavior is largely determined by culturally defined gender roles, underpinned by ideologies of familism and collectivism. Despite concerns about the adverse results of smoking to their family members and households, non-smoking women ultimately maintain the (male) smokers' argument that smoking plays an important role in construction and maintenance of intra- and extra-family relationships. By accepting male smoking and men's engagement in the social practice of smoking and cigarette exchanges, women maintain their identities as supportive wives, filial daughters/in-law and responsible family members who pursue family collective interests at the expense of their own personal beliefs. Future smoking control initiatives that target non-smoking women to influence male smoking should take into account the women's overarching need to maintain the status and harmony of their families.

TI  - Farmer constraints on implementing Good Animal Husbandry Practices in Vietnam: case study on household pig production
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
AB  - Many studies have identified factors that influence the adoption of new technologies and management practices in livestock production to improve productivity, animal health and protect the environment. However, few studies have attempted to clarify the constraints faced by farmers in implementing these new management practices. This study identified 10 constraints on implementing good management practices designed to improve the health and productivity of pig production, ensure the health of workers, reduce environmental pollution and allow customers to trace the origins of their products, collectively known as Good Animal Husbandry Practices. Low output price and lack of capital were identified as the key constraints faced by 42.8% and 28.3% of farmers, respectively. Furthermore, specialized production was found to mitigate these two constraints in terms of income contribution, whereas access to credit was found to exacerbate them. Lack of knowledge was the only constraint perceived to be more severe by non-VietGAHP farmers than by their VietGAHP counterparts. Based on the above results for both VietGAHP and non-VietGAHP farmers, these constraints need to be addressed by improving financial situations through formal credit and focusing on specialized pig-producing households. For the non-VietGAHP group, delivery of information on new management practices through the government extension services should be implemented.

TI  - Ecosystem services management: An evaluation of green adaptations for urban development in Dhaka, Bangladesh
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB  - We evaluated green adaptation strategies (parks, gardens, green roof, rainwater harvest, green facades/wall, porous pavement, and green and blue belts) in the context of urban development and potential climate change impacts for the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Our review of relevant literature revealed substantial environmental (cooler and cleaner environment), economic (reduced energy demand, avoided cost of drainage maintenance, increased land values) and social (higher social interaction, improved mental and physical health) benefits arising from the maintenance and development of ecosystem services in major cities. Our evaluation of green adaptation strategies was undertaken with household surveys in three wards of Dhaka, expert interviews, and our personal experiences. Rooftop gardens/agriculture had very high social acceptance (85%) and economic feasibility and was commonly practiced in Dhaka, particularly among house owners. Pocket park, green roof, rainwater harvest, green facades/wall, porous pavement, and community garden were all considered to be highly feasible for implementation with collective efforts but had lower social acceptance. Many respondents were unwilling to pay for green adaptation strategies even knowing their benefits. Our research revealed that successful implementation of beneficial green adaptation will require public participation at all stages supported through awareness raising campaigns. Enforcement of laws and strong commitment from the government was also considered to be beneficial. However, more transparent cost-benefit analyses promoting the conservation of ecosystem services is required, particularly for resource-poor Dhaka. Green adaptations make cities more resilient to pressures from demographic change and climate change increasingly relevant in the developing world.

TI  - Does willingness-to-pay for weather index-based insurance follow covariant shocks?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role that weather shocks can play in the livestock mortality microinsurance take-up when the insured risk has a prevalent covariant component.
   Design/methodology/approach - The sample consists of 360 rural Ethiopian households. Data were collected in a panel-structure at the end of three agricultural seasons (2011-2013). In the questionnaire, a specific section on insurance was meant to collect information on the farmer's willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a set of insurance products, including livestock mortality insurance. Two OLS regression models and a quantile regression model were employed to estimate the impact of weather anomalies on the WTP for the insurance product.
   Findings - The authors find that weather anomalies contribute to changes in the WTP to a large extent. Negative (positive) changes in precipitation (temperature) anomalies can lead to more than a 30 percent reduction in the WTP. This general finding is complemented with the analysis of the conditional distribution of the WTP, which shows that other elements can prevail for low values of the conditional distribution. In this case, the WTP seems to be represented more by the interviewee's age and basic knowledge of insurance, and village fixed-effects. Basic knowledge of insurance, in particular, can increase WTP by about 60 percent.
   Practical implications - This paper has straightforward implications from a policy perspective. It suggests that farmers would prefer an insurance premium that follows the changes in the systemic component. On the contrary, insurance as well as reinsurance companies are usually reluctant to frequently revise their premiums. Financial education programs, farmer- driven design, trust building, and bundling insurance with other financial and non-financial products can increase the value proposition perceived by the farmers. From a marketing perspective, the overall findings suggest that continuous fine-tuning of the contract, transparency, and targeted information campaigns can contribute to increase and stabilize potential customers' WTP.
   Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper that considers the impact of weather shocks on the WTP for a livestock mortality insurance product. Livestock is one of the most strategic assets of poor rural households in Africa. This study contributes to the theoretical and empirical literature on the determinants of weather insurance take-up in developing countries and, in particular, the role of spatiotemporal adverse selection and basis risk (e.g. Jensen et al., 2016).

This study aims to discover the direct and mediated effects of land fragmentation on collective action in China based on an empirical test and the social-ecological system framework. We introduce three innovations to the literature on collective action in the commons. First, we focus on the mechanism of land fragmentation on collective action in the commons, which has been largely ignored in the literature. Second, building on the social-ecological system framework, we use structural equation modeling, which is robust to endogeneity and latent variable problems. Third, we use original survey data from 3895 households and 284 villages from 17 provinces/regions in China, a critical case because China has some of the most fragmented farmland use in the world. We find that land fragmentation has a direct negative effect on irrigation collective action. And besides the direct negative effect, there are four indirect factors: dependency on farming, irrigation rule-making, economic pressure and land circulation. Of these, the first three have a negative effect, and the last one, a positive effect. Our findings add to the theoretical literature on collective action in the commons and suggest new policy handles for more efficient land and labor markets in China.

TI  - Learning achievements of farmers during the transition to market-oriented organic agriculture in rural Uganda
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE TROPICS AND SUBTROPICS
AB  - Organic agriculture requires fanners with the ability to develop profitable agro-enterprises on their own. By drawing on four years of experiences with the Enabling Rural Innovation approach in Uganda, we outline how smallholder farmers transition to organic agriculture and, at the same time, increase their entrepreneurial skills and competences through learning. In order to document this learning we operationalised the Kirkpatrick learning evaluation model, which subsequently informed the collection of qualitative data in two study sites. Our analysis suggests that the Enabling Rural Innovation approach helps farmers to develop essential capabilities for identifying organic markets and new organic commodities, for testing these organic commodities under varying organic farm management scenarios, and for negotiating contracts with organic traders. We also observed several obstacles that confront farmers' transition to organic agriculture when using the Enabling Rural Innovation approach. These include the long duration of agronomic experimentation and seed multiplication, expensive organic certification procedures and the absence of adequate mechanism for farmers to access crop finance services. Despite prevailing obstacles we conclude that the Enabling Rural Innovation approach provides a starting point for farmers to develop entrepreneurial competences and profitable agro-enterprises on their own.

TI  - Variation of water quality in Kakira catchment area, Jinja - Uganda
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
CP  - 9th Annual Symposium of the WaterNet/WARF SA/GWP-SA on Water and Sustainable Development for Improved Livelihoods
AB  - Kakira Sugar Works Limited (KSWL) owns one of the largest commercial sugarcane plantations and factory in Uganda. KSWL uses fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides to enhance crop yields. This study was carried out to assess the effect of the KSWL sugarcane plantation on the water resources of Lake Victoria. Water quality assessment within and without the sugarcane plantation was carried out for six months over two seasons (wet and dry) and these were tested for physico-chemical parameters. Temperature values at all the sampling sites were <35 degrees C. pH values at all the sampling sites were within the range of 6.0-8.5 except S4 which was located in the outgrowers' field (pH = 5.9). Electrical conductivity values on the stream draining through the workers settlement was high (1412.3 mu S/cm) compared to the other sampling sites which had values <300 mu S/cm. NH4-N and TN values at all the sampling sites were <10 mg/l. Although TP and O-PO4-P values for all the streams were within standards recommended by the National Environment Standard (Standards for Discharge of Effluents onto Water or on Land Regulations) of 1999 for Uganda, the sampling sites including the one located at the lake did not qualify to be categorized as being pristine. Nutrient loads were higher during the wet season than in the dry season. Nutrient loads from the estate were higher than those from the outgrowers' field. in spite of the fact that nutrient concentrations were within permissible limits, it was concluded that annual nutrient loads of nitrogen and phosphorus could in a long run increase the trophic levels of Lake Victoria.

TI  - Making agro-export entrepreneurs out ofCampesinos: the role of water policy reform, agricultural development initiatives, and the specter of climate change in reshaping agricultural systems in Piura, Peru
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - To increase agricultural exports across the Global South, countries are seeking to transform agrarian landscapes and the nature of campesino or smallholder agriculture. These agricultural reforms, however, do not exist in isolation. They work in conjunction with water policy reform to reshape agricultural systems and the people who manage these landscapes. While there has been significant research on agrarian change under neoliberal reform, few scholars have conducted empirical studies that examine how agricultural policy leverages water policy reform to generate changes across agricultural landscapes. Drawing on the case study of the Piura River basin in Northern Peru, this paper first explores how the IWRM inspired 2009 Water Resources Law furthers the state's agricultural development priorities by shifting water toward agro-export production. Secondly, this study demonstrates how climate change is being discursively mobilized as an emerging driver of water scarcity to legitimize these water reallocations. Thirdly, this case highlights how these water reallocations work in concert with the reinstatement of targeted agricultural support programs that seek to transform smallholder farmers into "agro-export entrepreneurs" but with meaningful exclusions. This study contributes to the limited scholarship on the 2009 Water Resources Law in Peru and also raises broader questions regarding how IWRM water management, climate change adaptation discourse, and agricultural development policy collectively promote the globalization of smallholder agriculture.

TI  - Shifting or drifting? The crisis-driven advancement and failure of private smallholder irrigation from sand river aquifers in southern arid Zimbabwe
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB  - In recent years more recognition is given to the benefits and risks of private smallholder irrigation development across sub-Saharan Africa. It is acknowledged for its capacity to adapt to local circumstances and challenges. This study assesses the heterogeneous character of private smallholder irrigation in the challenging environment of southern arid Zimbabwe, where family farms operate along sand river aquifers, forming a reliable natural storage of shallow groundwater. It investigates the drivers, characteristics, obstacles and adaptive capacity of this yet undocumented form of private irrigation in a historically marginalised area, and in particular also the discontinuation of these informal irrigation ventures. The research combines results from analysing satellite images, and quantitative and qualitative field work, whereby a social-ecological system perspective is applied.
   This form of private smallholder irrigation is distinct from most other documented cases in sub-Saharan Africa. First, because of the unique interrelation between the water source, technology need and fuel-dependency in an economically marginalised area. Second, because drivers for the emergence of private smallholder irrigation are not market-based but crisis-driven; recurrent droughts and frequent dry-spells, failure of collectively-managed irrigation schemes, and persistent economic instability. As a result, many families cease operations because they reach the limits of their adaptive capacity or they migrate. Those who succeed, manage to benefit from the abundance of water stored in sand rivers, the mobilisation of knowledge and cash through rural networks, and the existence of cross-border trade opportunities. However, they hardly ever pass the level of subsistence in an area where stable markets are absent. Organising potential support to private smallholder irrigation remains a challenging and disputable avenue as this might undermine its independent and adaptive nature.

TI  - Infrastructure Performance and Irrigation Water Governance in Genadendal, Western Cape, South Africa
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Disasters such as the 2015-2018 drought in South Africa usually negatively impact agricultural water, especially in smallholder farming systems. This study assessed the availability of irrigation water, performance of irrigation infrastructure, and water governance systems in Genadendal, Western Cape, with a focus on smallholder farmers. Data for streamflow, dam levels, and rainfall were acquired from water institutions and analysed using Microsoft Excel. The performance of the infrastructure and water governance were assessed based on the perceptions of smallholder farmers and key informants. A questionnaire was administered to eight smallholder farmers, followed by a focus group discussion with fifteen smallholder farmers. Interviews were conducted with eight key informants who worked in water-related institutions. Qualitative data from the interviews were analysed using thematic content analysis. The study showed adequate agricultural water resources during the 2015-2018 drought period for the smallholder farmers who relied on water from dams. However, smallholder farmers who relied on the Riviersonderend River experienced severe water shortages during the same period. The findings showed poor performance of irrigation water infrastructure due to inadequate maintenance. Lack of coordination among institutions, insufficient funding, political interference, fragmentation of roles and responsibilities, lack of human resources, and farmers' lack of participation and commitment in water resource management all contributed to the dysfunctionality of irrigation water governance systems, leading to water insecurity. This study concludes that while agricultural water resources in Genadendal are sufficient, water governance systems need improvement in order to strengthen the water security status for smallholder farmers. This study recommends adequate funding for the operation and maintenance of infrastructure. Furthermore, water institutions need to support smallholder farmers with training skills in agricultural water management and infrastructure maintenance. Further studies are recommended to quantify the amount of water lost due to the poor performance of water infrastructure and to develop effective water governance in Genadendal. In addition, issues relating to crop varieties and changes in cropping intensity during drought periods need to be considered in future studies.

TI  - The Impact of Collective Forestland Tenure Reform on the Forest Economic Efficiency of Farmers in Zhejiang Province
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The impact of collective forestland tenure reform on farmers' economic efficiency in the collective forest areas was assessed. Both technical efficiency and scale efficiency of farmer households were calculated using the output-oriented bootstrapped data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach along with a household efficiency model that incorporates the survey data from 243 farmer households. The DEA results show that a substantial economic inefficiency for farmers exists, which renders a high prospect of improving economic efficiency. The findings from the empirical regression of the data also show that the collective forestland tenure reform is quite beneficial for the farmer households, particularly for those with distinguished commercial forest types. The tenure reform has a very influential impact on the efficiency of the farmers managing timber forests and bamboo forests, and so do the policies of reform for forestland circulation, forest-cutting quotas, forestland loan, and technical training. However, the cooperation arrangement currently is still not strong enough to influence economic efficiency. Based on the regression findings, together with the survey, a number of policy suggestions are put forward to the policy makers for improving economic efficiencies for international communities in the process of forestland tenure devolution.

TI  - Constraints on smallholder market oriented dairy systems in the north eastern coastal region of Tanzania
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - Twenty five smallholder dairy farmers and other stakeholders, through a Participatory Rural Appraisal in three wards of the Tanga township of north cast coastal Tanzania, ranked their perceived constraints in descending order of importance: Low milk price and marketing, feed shortage in the dry season, poor management, low animal productivity, poor reproductive performance and diseases. Tick borne diseases were reported on a majority of farms. An Economic Opportunity Survey revealed wide ranges in management indices and improvement in annual milk production, age at first calving and lactation length to represent the best potential for gain. Performance generally was below locally set targets. Farmers spent on average in the three wards between 39% and 77% of income from milk on feed costs yearly. Interventions were instituted emphasising those that farmers could afford immediately. They included farmer training, dry season feed supplementation, tick control, improvement of animal shed/house cleanliness and the formation of a cooperative for milk marketing. Partial budgeting is being used to monitor success. Follow-up meetings and regular visits to farms by field officers are disseminating information on outcomes to encourage farmers to continue with interventions and spread useful knowledge to friends and neighbours.

TI  - Characterization of farmer-based cooperative societies in the upper west region of Ghana
T2  - ANNALS OF PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - The study describes the ownership and governance characteristics and the challenges of farmer-based cooperative societies from three districts in the Upper West Region of Ghana. Primary data were obtained from 59 active and 14 inactive cooperatives in the selected districts. The study concludes that Ghanaian cooperatives in the sample bear much resemblance to the traditional form which emerged in Europe and North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Generally, such cooperatives have relatively small memberships from local communities who use a democratic governance system and do not delegate control to outsiders. While the cost of owning and transacting is limited with such characteristics, many traditional cooperatives lack the specific knowledge, economic efficiency, and resource endowment necessary to become or remain competitive. Indeed, the active cooperatives listed finance, access to inputs, tractor services and poor leadership as key challenges, while inactive cooperatives blamed poor member commitment as the primary culprit for their inactivity. Efforts aimed at promoting and supporting farmer cooperatives should focus on addressing these key challenges. Also, financial and technical support should probably be conditional on group performance and not group formation itself.

TI  - Comparing Maternal Services Utilization and Expense Reimbursement before and after the Adjustment of the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme Policy in Rural China
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   The New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) includes a maternal care benefits package that is associated with increasing maternal health services. The local compensation policies have been frequently adjusted in recent years. This study examined the association between the NCMS maternal-services policy adjustment and expense reimbursement in Yuyao, China.
   Methods
   Two household surveys were conducted in Yuyao in 2008 and 2011 (before and after the NCMS policy adjustment, respectively). Local women (N = 154) who had delivery history in the past three years were recruited. A questionnaire was used to collect information about delivery history, maternal health services utilization (prenatal care, postnatal care, and the grade of delivery institutions), NCMS participation, and reimbursement status. Logistic regression analyses were used to predict the association between policy adjustment and maternal health utilization and the association between policy adjustment and out-of-pocket proportion. Next, t-tests and covariance analyses adjusting for household income were used to compare the out-of-pocket proportion between 2008 and 2011.
   Results
   Results revealed that compensation policy adjustment was associated with an increase in postnatal visits (adjusted OR = 3.32, p = 0.009) and the use of second level or above institutions for delivery (adjusted OR = 2.32, p = 0.03) among participants. In 2008, only 9.1% of pregnant women received reimbursement from the NCMS; however, this rate increased to 36.8% in 2011. After policy adjustment, there were no significant changes in the proportion of out-of-pocket expenses shared in delivery fee (F = 0.24, p = 0.63) and in household income (F = 0.46, p = 0.50).
   Conclusions
   Financial compensation increase improved maternal health services utilization; however, this effect was limited. Although the reimbursement rate was raised, the out-of-pocket proportion was not significant changed; therefore, the compensation design scheme must be adjusted in practice.

TI  - Community Initiatives and Local Networks among K'ho Cil Smallholder Coffee Farmers in the Central Highlands of Vietnam: A Case Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN AND AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - Over the last two decades, coffee growers in Vietnam have faced the same problems as farmers all over the world. Ethnographic research among the community of K'ho Cil coffee growers in Lam Dong Province from 2016 to 2018 documented local initiatives to deal with the problems through the establishment of a K'ho Coffee network, revitalization of traditional production patterns, local integration into the global coffee commodity chain and agritourism entrepreneurship. Conceptualizing the way local K'ho Coffee growers generated and implemented the initiatives, this paper argues that by utilizing their social network, local farmers revitalized their economic production. Negotiating a decent collective position in the world system of the coffee commodity chain offers them a chance to survive the influx of economic deregulation and avert the impacts of climate change.

TI  - Social Desirability, Opportunism and Actual Support for Farmers' Market Organisations in Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - One of the striking issues in the literature on farmers' market organisations (FMOs) is that farmers generally report quite positive opinions regarding the services of their FMO, while, at the same time, actual sales reveal a much more reserved attitude. We argue that farmers may feel social and/or opportunistic pressure to express positive opinions concerning the FMO, to donors and policy-makers, which are not necessarily in line with their actions. This article proposes a list experiment method to control for this bias. The method shows that especially farmers who express strong support for the FMO seriously hesitate to speak freely.

TI  - Evaluating the roles of the farmer's cooperative for fostering environmentally friendly production technologies-a case of kiwi-fruit farmers in Meixian, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The agricultural cooperative may significantly impact the adoption of environmentally friendly production technologies, which eventually help the farmers with better living standards and productivity. However, critical evaluation of how and to what extent the cooperative organization's participation leads the farmer's adoption of environmentally friendly technology (EFT) is relatively unclear. Thus, to critically explore the knowledge gap, the study evaluates the effects of cooperative participation towards adopting environmentally friendly production technologies based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The key variables used in the study have been extracted from an extensive literature investigation, while the empirical data has been collected from October to December 2020 from 292 kiwi-fruit farmers within the Shaanxi province of China. Simultaneously, the partial least square of structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) tools has been utilized to craft the final assessment. The factor loadings of all three latent variables have been statistically significant and interrelated for quantifying the proposed model. The statistically proven framework portrayed that cooperative organizations' participation positively impacts and shapes behavioral factors and facilitates the adoption of environmentally friendly production technologies. The study found the social structure like China, the impacts of cooperation could be crucial. As cooperative participation is an ample predictor for facilitating environmentally friendly technologies, the government should broaden the technical supports, and agricultural extension should also provide extended training for a smooth transition of the cooperatives.

TI  - Does the design matter? Comparing satellite-based indices for insuring pastoralists against drought
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - For those developing satellite-based insurance products, there is no consensus in the scientific community on which of the many available indices most accurately track agro-ecological shocks as experienced by farmers and pastoralists. Furthermore, metrics commonly used by the remote sensing community for assessing the accuracy of indices in retrieving biophysical variables are insufficient in the case of insurance, because they do not consider the value of insurance coverage in terms of household welfare. This study begins to fill this knowledge gap by bridging two index insurance literatures: the remote sensing science literature that focuses on the predictive power of indices, and the economic literature that focuses on welfare outcomes. The article uses a longitudinal panel of household survey data from Kenya to compare the quality of existing and potential insurance products. These products are developed from different processing chains applied to time series of the satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVD. Although the indices are highly correlated to each other (rho > 0.95), a utility analysis provides insight into how small differences can lead to larger differences in product value. Our results highlight that index accuracy, cost, and timeliness of payments must be considered jointly when assessing insurance quality for clients.

TI  - Effects of Fair Trade Certification on Social Capital: The Case of Rwandan Coffee Producers
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Fair Trade certification may have important social effects on small-scale producers but empirical evidence is limited. We conducted logistic regressions using data from a 2009 survey of Rwandan coffee farmers to estimate the link between Fair Trade and social capital-measured as farmer trust and participation-while controlling for various other factors that could influence social capital, particularly membership in a cooperative organization. The results show a negative association between Fair Trade and farmer trust in cooperative leadership and a positive association with a perceived higher level of participation of women. Social capital is linked most significantly to farmers' interaction with their neighbors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of female reproductive competition on birth rate and reproductive scheduling in a historical human population
T2  - BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Personality affects response to alarm calls. This study reveals that boldness explains how vigilant chipmunks behave in response to alarm calls, and that vigilance diminishes in response to shyer callers. Chipmunks thus evaluate the personality of callers and discount the danger associated with calls from highly risk-sensitive individuals. Adjusting responsiveness relative to caller reliability improves foraging while reducing the risk of predation.Costly reproductive competition among females is predicted to lead to strategies that reduce these costs, such as reproductive schedules. Simultaneous births of coresident women in human families can reduce their infant survival, but whether such competition also affects overall birth rates and whether females time their pregnancies to avoid simultaneous births remain unknown, despite being key questions for understanding how intrafemale competition affects reproductive strategies. Here, we used detailed parish registers to study female reproductive competition in historical Finnish joint-families, where brothers stayed on their natal farms and sisters married out, and consequently unrelated daughters-in-law often coresided and competed for household resources. We quantified the time-varying effects of having reproductive-aged competitor(s) on a woman's interval from marriage to first childbirth, on age-specific fertility, and on birth scheduling. Contrary to our hypothesis, the presence of one or several potential female competitors did not lead to longer first birth intervals or lower age-specific probability of reproduction. We also found no evidence that women would schedule their reproduction to avoid the real cost of simultaneous births on their offspring mortality risk; age-specific reproductive rates were unaltered by changes in the presence of other infants in the household. These results raise interesting questions regarding the evolution of fertility suppression in social mammals in different contexts, the costs and benefits of extended families for female reproductive success and strategies deployed, and the cultural practices that may help to avoid the negative outcomes of female reproductive competition in human families.

TI  - Agroecology as a pathway to resilience justice: peasant movements and collective action in the Niayes coastal region of Senegal
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB  - In semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa, farming populations face harsh climatic conditions but also very unequal and dynamic social processes that affect their resilience. This study addresses aspects of power and social justice related to the social-ecological system of the Niayes coastal region of Senegal and examines the potential of agroecology to improve the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers. We performed a knowledge co-production process with a local farmer union to identify the main social-ecological nexuses that matter for smallholder farmers, their dynamics and the influence of powerful actors and institutions on them. We also look at the potential actions of the farmer union under the banner of agroecology to transform these dynamics. We found that social-ecological dynamics involve reinforcing feedback loops that undermine the resilience of smallholder farmers and that powerful actors such as agribusinesses have a strong influence on these processes. Union actions promoting agroecology have enhanced system thinking and related solutions, but observed social justice claims are very recent and have a limited scope. Our findings expand the notion of resilience grabbing, understood as the undermining of resilience through the loss of commons, to include systemic degradations due to direct and indirect actions of involved stakeholders. We also propose to expand the notion of resilience justice vertically, integrating procedural and recognition justice, and horizontally, integrating linked social-ecological issues. We conclude that agroecology can become a transformative bridge from resilience grabbing to resilience justice, but must be more sensitive to power relations, in particular around labour.

TI  - Agricultural Bank Credit Intervention and The Application of Big Push Theory to Beneficiaries: Evidence From Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF TEKIRDAG AGRICULTURE FACULTY-TEKIRDAG ZIRAAT FAKULTESI DERGISI
AB  - Up till now there is shortage of empirical evidence on volume of loan received that generates big push for the farmers and the bank to curtail abuse of fund and its determinants. The purpose of this study is to examine the agricultural bank credit intervention and the application of big push theory among beneficiaries in Nigeria so as to make advocacy for a bailout intervention. A total of 295 beneficiaries were randomly selected. A questionnaire was developed, and data collection was undertaken by means of a multistage sampling technique. Descriptive statistics, regression model and t-test analysis were used to analyze the data. The mean age of beneficiaries was 46 years old. The respondents had an average household size of 6 persons with 79.3% of the beneficiaries being literate with one form of formal education or the other. About 65.4% of the beneficiaries did not subscribe to membership of farmers groups. The beneficiaries had 13 years' experience in arable crop fanning. The average farm size was 1.57 ha. This tells us that the beneficiaries were small scale farmers. The result reveals that the region of big push was between $244.34-$977.37 The variables that had positive and substantial relationship with big push in the model were age of respondent, years spent in farming, education, farm size, cooperative membership, household size, collateral requirement and marital status. The outcome of the t-test indicated that there was much impact after benefiting from agricultural bank credit loan scheme in the area. The foremost constraints were collateral requirement and high interest rate. Loan acquisition procedure by agricultural bank credit should be made easier as well as the threshold of farmers financial management ability should be considered during disbursement of loan to farmers for effective utilization.

TI  - Power, supply chain integration and quality performance of agricultural products: evidence from contract farming in China
T2  - PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL
AB  - Improving the quality of agricultural products is crucial for facilitating sustainable agricultural development. One widely embraced approach is contract farming, which generates guarantees-necessary for sustaining the continuous operations of vulnerable farmers-while enabling manufacturers to manage the aggregate supply chain risks and prices. Although management researchers have investigated power and quality performance issues between organisations, few have examined their impact on contract farming. This paper extends the literature by examining the relationships between power, supply chain integration and the quality performance of agricultural products, from the perspectives of farm households and agribusiness companies in contract farming. This study proposes and empirically examines a model, applying survey data from 78 agricultural companies and 321 peasant householders in China. The results show that different types of power have different effects on contract farming. In particular, non-economic power significantly and positively affects supply chain integration. Its impact on process coordination is greater than its impact on information sharing. The effect of economic power on supply chain integration is different from the binary perspective. These findings have positive theoretical and practical significance for agribusiness and will help farmers to improve the quality of primary agricultural products and achieve sustainable agricultural development.

TI  - Current radiological situation in areas of Ukraine contaminated by the Chernobyl accident: Part 1. Human dietary exposure to Caesium-137 and possible mitigation measures
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - This study reports for the first time temporal trends for the period of 2011-2016 in Cs-137 content in cow's milk originating from private farms and households of 14 settlements located in the territories of the Rivne region, Ukraine. These areas are still radioactively contaminated as a result of the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (ChNPP) in 1986. In 2016, the average Cs-137 activity concentration in milk exceeded the Ukrainian Permissible Level (PL) for adults of 100 Bq/l in samples from 6 settlements and the PL for children of 40 Bq/l in 8 settlements, reaching activity concentration of around 500 Bq/l in some samples. Estimated annual effective doses calculated utilizing two different methodologies were in the range of 1.4-2.6 mSv/year and 1.2-1.8 mSv/ year, respectively. The estimated effective period of milk semi-purification (T1/2-eff) from Cs-137 in these settlements was in the range from 8 to 17 years. The estimated ecological period of milk semi-purification (T1/2-eco) from Cs-137 was in the range from 11 to 36 years. The optimization of the remedial actions strategy for investigated settlements exposed to an effective dose above 1 mSv/year (as estimated in 2016) has shown that a diversity of measures can decrease effective dose for a representative person to below 1 mSv/year. Such measures include application of Ferrocyn to cows, mineral fertilization of potato fields, information campaigns on consumption of wild mushrooms and other forestry products, and feeding pigs with uncontaminated fodder. The total costs of such measures are estimated to be about 71,000 Euro per year for the combined population (8336 inhabitants) of the six villages investigated in this study that showed the highest median residual Cs-137 activity concentrations in milk, with a subsequent decrease in cost in the future. This would result in an averted collective dose of 11 man-Sv, at an average cost of 6.5 kEuro/man-Sv averted. In the absence of governmental programs for implementation of necessary protective measures to reduce radiological risks to impacted populations, the exceedance of PL for the activity concentration of Cs-137 in cow's milk for adults of 100 Bq/l in the Chernobyl-affected areas of Ukraine could persist for many more years - until at least 2040.

TI  - Determinants of Smallholder Farmers' Marketing Channel Choice: Evidence from the Vietnamese Rice Sector
T2  - ASIAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL
AB  - Cash crops such as specialty rice and other high-value varieties produced for domestic and international markets are considered an increasing source of income for smallholder farmers in many Asian countries. The present study focuses on the factors affecting Vietnamese specialty rice farmers' choice of marketing channel and how their choice influences farm performance. The analysis has been conducted using multinomial logit and linear regression models on quantitative data collected from 280 specialty rice farmers in the Red River Delta, one of the main rice production regions in Vietnam. Results reveal that even though local collectors and wholesalers are still the most common recipients of farmers' goods in rural areas, reduction in transaction costs with regard to uncertainty influences farmers to choose modern marketing channels through collective action (via specialty rice farmer associations). This collective marketing channel helps farmers increase average prices received by US$0.028 per kg of paddy. Based on the results, manifold political implications are derived.

TI  - Formal markets and informal insurance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF LAW AND ECONOMICS
CP  - Workshop on Law and Economic Development
AB  - "Contractual interlinkages" in the rural communities of developing countries may be a key element of informal insurance when information is incomplete, and may influence the evolution of the distribution of resources. The introduction of "modern" credit markets may undermine these interlinkages, and consequently limit the usefulness of informal insurance. Using data which assigns households in a transitional Indian village to either a "modern" or "traditional" regime, we examine differences in financial transactions across these regimes. Traditional hoseholds receive more frequent "in-kind" transfers of food and clothing, While also more frequently making "in-kind" payments of crop output to others in the village.

TI  - Forest land rights, tenure types, and farmers' investment incentives in China An empirical study of Fujian Province
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of land rights and tenure types on farmers' investment behavior in Chinese collective forests, using household survey data from Fujian Province.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the authors conducted a household survey in Fujian province of 520 randomly selected forest farmers. The authors used a random-effects Tobit model to estimate the impact of land rights and other components on, for example, tenure security and harvest quota, and the impact of tenure types on farmers' investment incentives.
   Findings - This study produced three main findings: perceived tenure security in the context of frequent agricultural land redistribution negatively affects input intensity; farmers still perceive some tenure arrangements to be more uncertain than others, which discourages them from undertaking investments on such plots; and the harvest quota regulation, introduced to conserve forest stock, has in fact acted as a disincentive in forestry management.
   Originality/value - Almost all previous studies are based on national or regional data, which have primarily focused on the links between tenure types and investment incentives. In this study, based on the plot-level data, the authors are able to assess not only the impacts of tenure types but also how specific land rights and their components affect farmers' investment behavior.

TI  - Are Collective Trading Organisations Necessarily Inclusive of Smallholder Farmers?: A Comparative Analysis of Farmer-led Auctions in the Javanese Chilli Market
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
AB  - Organising smallholder farmers into groups or co-operatives is widely promoted as a strategy to connect farmers to markets and turn them into price makers rather than price takers. This pathway usually combines co-operative organisational models, based on collective ownership and representation in internal governance, with measures to shorten the agri-food chain, shifting the ownership of intermediary sourcing, aggregating and trading functions to the group. The underlying assumption is that this improves smallholder farmers' terms of inclusion in markets. To scrutinise this assumption, our study compares two examples of farmer-led auctions facilitating trading in the chilli market in Java, Indonesia. The auctions' ownership, management and performance evolved differently: one was run by a group and the other by a family. The comparison brings nuance to the prevalent emphasis on co-operative ownership structures. By researching practices central to collective trading at the chilli supplier-trader interface, this study unravels four dimensions-ownership, voice, reward and risk-capturing smallholder chilli farmers' terms of inclusion in both the auctions and the market. Our comparative analysis suggests that shared ownership and control of the trading function, a central feature of co-operative models, does not necessarily ensure favourable terms of inclusion for smallholder farmers with little capacity to take risks. The capacity to reconfigure the terms of market inclusion for vulnerable smallholder farmers involves direct payment modalities and risk taking. A collectively owned trading organisation does not necessarily imply an inclusive business concept when the organisation cannot acquire sufficient working capital to pay its suppliers.

TI  - Collective arrangements and social networks: Coping strategies for the poor households in the Great Ruaha Catchment in Tanzania
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
CP  - 7th WaterNet/Warfsa/GWP SA Symposium
AB  - Access to water and land resources underpins the socio-economic fabric of many societies in the Southern Africa region, which is characterized broadly as underdeveloped with widespread food insecurity, exacerbated by persistent droughts, erratic rainfalls and increasing human populations. The availability of land and water resources is increasingly diminishing and becoming a stumbling block to the development of the agrarian societies in the region. The poor households have in turn adopted new livelihood coping mechanisms but little research has been done to assess the effectiveness of these 'instruments'. Consequently, the concepts of sustainable water resources management and agricultural development have remained elusive and poorly understood by policy makers as well as by water resources planners and managers. Recognizing this, a study was conducted between 2002 and 2005 under the RIPARWIN (Raising Irrigation Productivity and Releasing Water for Intersectoral Needs) project to assess the spatial dynamics of livelihood capital, vulnerability and coping strategies for the poor agrarian households in the Upper Great Ruaha River Catchment (GRRC) in Tanzania. The results of analysis showed an array of livelihood platforms and institutional contexts that act to shape the existing livelihood typologies in the GRRC. In addition, the results showed a gradual increase in household vulnerability from upstream to downstream, particularly in terms of access to physical and natural assets. Vulnerability was found to be directly associated with the number of dependants. The female-headed households were relatively more likely to be vulnerable than the male-headed households (cf. probabilities of 27% and 21%, respectively). The value of collective arrangements and drawing on social networks crosscut all social strata and ranked as the most common livelihood strategy. This suggests that the scope for reducing vulnerability among the poor households in the GRRC critically depends on the existing institutional arrangements and mechanisms. Of paramount importance is perhaps the need to facilitate the establishment and empowerment of water use associations and apex bodies. In the study area, this appears to be promising enough to build 'strong' institutional platforms through which water and land resources would be managed sustainably. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Does the medical insurance system play a real role in reducing catastrophic economic burden in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease in China? Implication for accurately targeting vulnerable characteristics
T2  - GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundThe vulnerability of cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients' health abilities, combined with the severity of the disease and the overlapping risk factors, leads such people to bear the economic burden of the disease due to the medical services. We estimated the economic burden of CVD and identified the weak link in the design of the medical insurance.MethodsData from 5610 middle-aged and elderly with CVD were drawn from the 2015 wave of "China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study" (CHARLS). The recommended method of the "World Health Organization" (WHO) was adopted to calculate "catastrophic health expenditure" (CHE), "impoverishment by medical expenses" (IME), and applied the treatment-effect model to analyze the determinants of CHE.ResultsThe incidence of CHE was 19.9% for the elderly families with CVD members, which was 3.6% higher than for uninsured families (16.3%). Families with CVD combined with >3 other chronic diseases (38.88%) were the riskiest factor for the high CHE in the new rural cooperative medical system (NCMS). Moreover, families with members >75years old (33.33%), having two chronic disease (30.74%), and families having disabled members (33.33%), hospitalization members (32.41%) were identified as the high risky determinants for the high CHE in NCMS.ConclusionsElderly with physical vulnerabilities were more prone to CHE. The medical insurance only reduced barriers to accessing health resources for elderly with CVD; however it lacked the policy inclination for high-utilization populations, and had poorly accurate identification of the vulnerable characteristics of CVD, which in turn affects the economic protection ability of the medical insurance. The dispersion between the multiple medical security schemes leads to the existence of blind spots in the economic risk protection of individuals and families.

TI  - Risk aversion and certification: Evidence from the Nepali tea fields
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - By setting out rules for how food should be produced and processed to meet market requirements, agricultural standards can connect farmers to lucrative markets. Yet their adoption has been far from widespread. Demographic factors have been shown to affect farmers' decision to get certified to an agricultural standard. However, little is known about the relationship between risk and certification, despite evidence that risk aversion affects farmers' production decisions. This paper examines the role of individual risk attitudes in the decision to get certified to an agricultural standard. I conducted a survey and a field experiment to elicit the risk preferences of Nepali small-scale tea farmers who faced the decision of whether to get certified to the organic standard. The analysis uses an expected utility framework to investigate the relationship between risk preferences and certification decisions. Results indicate that farmers who are more risk averse have a higher propensity to get certified. These findings suggest that risk considerations should be incorporated into analysis of certification. They also provide concrete evidence against previous assumptions that only risk lovers get certified. Instead, they suggest that certification schemes may provide a benefit not yet considered in the literature: that of providing risk-reduction opportunities to risk averse farmers in developing countries.

TI  - Non-governmental organization facilitation of a community-based nutrition and health program: Effect on program exposure and associated infant feeding practices in rural India
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Integrated nutrition and health programs seek to reduce undernutrition by educating child caregivers about infant feeding and care. Data on the quality of program implementation and consequent effects on infant feeding practices are limited. This study evaluated the effectiveness of enhancing a nutrition and health program on breastfeeding and complementary-feeding practices in rural India.
   Methods
   Utilizing a quasi-experimental design, one of the implementing districts of a Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE) nutrition and health program was randomly selected for enhanced services and compared with a district receiving the Government of India's standard nutrition and health package alone. A cohort of 942 mother-child dyads was longitudinally followed from birth to 18 months. In both districts, the evaluation focused on responses to services delivered by community-based nutrition and health care providers [anganwadi workers (AWWs) and auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs)].
   Findings
   The CARE enhanced program district showed an improvement in program coverage indicators (e.g., contacts, advice) through outreach visits by both AWWs (28.8-59.8% vs. 0.7-12.4%; all p<0.05) and ANMs (8.6-46.2% vs. 6.1-44.2%; <0.05 for ages >= 6 months). A significantly higher percentage of child caregivers reported being contacted by the AWWs in the CARE program district (20.5-45.6% vs. 0.3-21.6%; p<0.05 for all ages except at 6months). No differences in ANM household contacts were reported. Overall, coverage remained low in both areas. Less than a quarter of women received any infant feeding advice in the intervention district. Earlier and exclusive breastfeeding improved with increasing number or quality of visits by either level of health care provider (OR: 2.04-3.08, p = <0.001), after adjusting for potentially confounding factors. Socio-demographic indicators were the major determinants of exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 month and age-appropriate complementary-feeding practices thereafter in the program-enhanced but not comparison district.
   Interpretation
   An enhanced nutrition and health intervention package improved program exposure and associated breastfeeding but not complementary-feeding practices, compared to standard government package.

TI  - The Economics of Smallholder Organic Contract Farming in Tropical Africa
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The paper examines the revenue effects of certified organic contract farming for smallholders and of adoption of organic agricultural fanning methods in a tropical African context. The comparison in both cases is with fanning systems that are "organic by default." Survey data from a large organic coffee contract farming scheme in Uganda are reported and analyzed using a standard OLS regression and a full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimate of the Heckman selection model. The analysis finds that, controlling for a range of factors, there are positive revenue effects both from participation in the scheme and, more modestly, from applying organic farming techniques.

TI  - Markets for forestland use rights: A case study in Southern China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Although China still holds land in collective and state ownership, land use rights have been largely privatized. While transactions for forestland use rights have taken place for more than two decades, few detailed investigations of the transactions have been conducted. This study investigates 222 households in eight villages of Linan and Anji counties located within Zhejiang Province, and reports details of the transactions, their scope and motivation, and the characteristics of households participating in the market for forestland use rights. The results indicate that farmers have become more active in land transactions. The factors influencing transactions are examined in a logit model. Income and sources of income are identified as important factors. Households with higher incomes are likely to buy more land, but households with a higher proportion of income from non-agricultural sources would be more likely to sell land and less likely to buy land. Whether a buyer or seller is satisfied with the price is another important factor for their engagement in a transaction. Some policy implications are discussed in this paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Insured Loans and Credit Access: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment in Northern GhanaJEL Codes
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We conducted a two-treatment randomized control trial in northern Ghana to investigate how bundling index insurance with agricultural loans affects smallholder access to credit. In one treatment, farmer groups were invited to apply for production loans bundled with an index insurance contract that, in the event of a drought, indemnifies farmers directly (micro-insured loans). In the second treatment, farmer groups were invited to apply for production loans bundled with an index insurance contract that, in the event of a drought, indemnifies the lender on the condition that the indemnity be used to retire the farmer's debt obligation (meso-insured loans). Farmer groups in the control category were invited to apply for uninsured loans. We find that insured loans increase farmers' likelihood of receiving credit by between 15 and 21 percentage points. Exploring the mechanisms of this effect, we find no impact on the likelihood that farmers apply for credit but do find an increase in the likelihood of loan approvals of between 17 and 25 percentage points.

TI  - Towards high value markets: a case study of smallholder vegetable farmers in Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - The expansion of modern markets has significant implications for agriculture in many developing countries that provides both opportunities and challenges for smallholder farmers. The purpose of this paper is to analyse key determinants affecting farmers' participation in high value markets, compared to traditional market. Face to face interviews based on a questionnaire were conducted with a sample of 126 smallholder vegetable farmers in the Manokwari region. Binary logistic regression and bivariate correlation analysis were used in this study. The results suggested that age, education level, vegetables cultivated area and membership in farmer groups/cooperatives were the key determinants that had significant effects on the smallholder farmers' decision about marketing channel participation. In addition, the income generated from vegetable farming was positively correlated to high value market participation. Some implications that need to be prioritized in agricultural development strategies include improving technical innovations and empowering collective actions through cooperatives or farmer groups.

TI  - Escaping the "quality-exclusion" trap in building geographical indications: some reflexions from the Penja pepper case
T2  - CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB  - The protection of geographical indications (GI) is considered in developing countries as a powerful tool for supporting origin products and for strengthening local agrifood production systems by improving farmers' market access. GI protection may have several effects that go far beyond the fight againstmisuses of the geographicalname and can stimulate a new organisation and functioning of the supply chain. Indeed, the GI protection requires an agreement of producers on a Code of practices that specifies the production area, the process and product characteristics, and on an appropriate control system. However, GI protection positive effects are often threatened, especially in the context of Southern countries, by what we call "quality-exclusion trap". In fact, searching for a better product qualification can cause the exclusion of less empowered producers. On the contrary, when the Code of practices and the control systems are too flexible, the GI scheme may be inefficient. The paper aims to analyse how the GI quality-exclusion trap could be managed in order to improve market access for small producers. Empirical evidences come from the case of Penja pepper (Cameroon) that obtained the registration as GI in 2013 thus becoming the first protected GI in the African Intellectual Property Organization area. Results highlight that in order to involve less empowered actors and to guarantee equity and efficiency of the GI protection, a set of accompanying actions and policies is required. Crucial issues concern how to fill the gap between the current practices and the rules of theCode of practices, the choices about the control system, and the provision of some public goods and services allowing the weakest actors to benefit of the protected GI as well.

TI  - Sustainability Performance of Certified and Non-certified Smallholder Coffee Farms in Uganda
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - The transition toward sustainable agricultural production can be supported with improved insight into the performance of existing farming systems. The Sustainability Assessments of Food and Agriculture Systems (SAFA) framework published by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) provides a comprehensive and harmonised framework to assess and compare farming systems. We used the indicator-based SAFA consistent Sustainability Monitoring and Assessment RouTine (SMART) Farm Tool to analyze and compare the sustain ability performance of certified organic and fair trade as well as non-certified smallholder farms in Uganda. Using the respective sustainability scores, we analyzed the synergies and trade-offs between sustainability themes using the non-parametric Spearman correlation test. We find that certification is associated with improved sustainability performance of smallholder coffee farms. It enhances the achievement of governance goals through its influences on group organization and collective capacities - this results in positive effects on other sustainability dimensions. Major synergies were observed between social and governance themes, and between economic and environmental themes. Although, the extent and distribution of the synergies and trade-offs varied among farms, they were consistent between the production systems. These results show that the production systems can potentially have more influence on the sustainability performance than certification per se.

TI  - Adaptive Capacity and Social-Environmental Change: Theoretical and Operational Modeling of Smallholder Coffee Systems Response in Mesoamerican Pacific Rim
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Communities who rely directly on the natural environment for their survival typically have developed risk management strategies to enable them to avoid dangerous thresholds of change to their livelihoods. Development policy appropriate for natural resource-based communities requires an understanding of the primary drivers of social-ecological change, the ways in which affected households autonomously respond to such drivers, and the appropriate avenues for intervention to reduce vulnerability. Coffee has been, and still remains, one of the most important commodities of the Mesoamerican region, and hundreds of thousands of smallholder households in the region are dependent in some way on the coffee industry for their livelihood stability. We used the Analytical Network Process to synthesize expert knowledge on the primary drivers of livelihood change in the region as well as the most common household strategies and associated capacities necessary for effective response. The assessment identified both gradual systemic processes as well as specific environmental and market shocks as significant drivers of livelihood change across the region. Agronomic adjustments and new forms of social organization were among the more significant responses of farmers to these changes. The assessment indicates that public interventions in support of adaptation should focus on enhancing farmers' access to market and technical information and finance, as well as on increasing the viability of farmers' organizations and cooperatives.

TI  - Impact of agricultural production outsourcing services on carbon emissions in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Increasing food output while reducing agricultural carbon emissions (ACE) is a major challenge to achieving green agriculture in China. Previously unexplored research regarding the relationship between agricultural production outsourcing services (APOS) and ACE is investigated using household microsurvey data in China and econometric methods, and the influencing mechanism is also tested empirically. The results reveal that APOS increases the total ACE and reduces ACE per unit area. The mechanism test shows that APOS are beneficial to the expansion of rice planting areas and farmers' adoption of agricultural green production techniques. The increasing effect of rice planting area on ACE was greater than the decreasing effect of green production techniques. In the future, China should accelerate the selection and breeding of rice varieties with low carbon emissions to reduce the increase of ACE caused by large-scale land management in the process of APOS development. Policy support and subsidies should be strengthened for APOS organizations to purchase green production techniques, so as to further drive farmers to adopt green production techniques and reduce ACE. It is also necessary for China to encourage small-scale farmers to outsource their agricultural production activities to APOS organizations. The role of collective action consciousness of agricultural production in increasing the supply capacity of APOS organizations should be enhanced.

TI  - Contract farming and smallholder incentives to produce high quality: experimental evidence from the Vietnamese dairy sector
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - In emerging markets for high-value food products in developing countries, processing companies search for efficient ways to source raw material of high quality. One widely embraced approach is contract farming. But relatively little is known about the appropriate design of financial incentives in a small farm context. We use the example of the Vietnamese dairy sector to analyze the effectiveness of existing contracts between a processor and smallholder farmers in terms of incentivizing the production of high quality milk. A framed field experiment is conducted to evaluate the impact of two incentive instruments, a price penalty for low quality and a bonus for consistent high quality milk, on farmers' investment in quality-improving inputs. Statistical analysis suggests that the penalty drives farmers into higher input use, resulting in better output quality. The bonus payment generates even higher quality milk. We also find that input choice levels depend on farmers' socio-economic characteristics such as wealth, while individual risk preferences seem to be less important. Implications for the design of contracts with smallholders are discussed.

TI  - Financing smallholder tree planting: Tree collateral & Thai 'Tree Banks'-Collateral 2.0?
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Smallholder foresters are amongst the key stakeholders for sustainable development and productive land use. In Thailand they face various challenges including insufficient tenure, burdensome commercialization, and limited access to markets. Similarly, forestry specific financial services are often unavailable. Key obstacles include cash flow constraints attributed to the long gestation periods and a lack of conventional collateral to obtain loans. As a response to the lack of sustainable financing mechanisms for forest smallholders, tree collateral and Tree Banks emerged in Thailand. This paper depicts the evolution of the innovative Thai tree collateral approaches and conceptualizes their intricacies. Tree collateral refers to the use of trees as a business security for loans. Thailand's innovative national Tree Bank systems provide the context for this case study. Based on expert interviews (n = 39) and subsequent secondary literature review as well as process tracing, the article explores potentials and shortcomings of the tree collateral approaches in Thailand. There are significant conceptual and ideological differences between the two Tree Bank institutions, namely the Tree Bank BAAC (Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives) and Tree Bank CSO (Civil Society Organization). These differences focus on the need to include private land together with trees as collateral. In addition, core constraints remain for tree collateral such as limited tenure and valuation procedures and high gearing ratios. The discussion of risks reveals mainly socio-economic and financial risks for smallholders and financing institutions. Standardization procedures and mitigation strategies including micro-insurances are indispensable. The process tracing revealed causal mechanisms that lead to tree collateral, including aggregation amongst smallholders as well as specific enabling policy reforms. Tree collateral represents an innovative and promising tool but is not the 'silver bullet' that magically solves the financial challenges of smallholders. Rather it is niche-specific and requires a series of broader prerequisites for successful and low-risk implementation especially in the context of smallholder forestry.

TI  - Balancing Democracy with Service Delivery: Power Relations, Politics and Accountability in Cooperatives Supporting Emergent Livestock Farmers in South Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS
AB  - In South Africa, cooperatives are the primary institutions through which delivery of governmental agricultural support programmes for rural communities is realised. Although these cooperatives are governed by clear national guidelines that encourage transparency and accountability to their membership, in reality their ability to realise this may be compromised by an imperative to achieve service delivery in an environment of limited governmental support. Drawing on empirical research undertaken at five agricultural cooperatives in the Elliot area of Eastern Cape Province, we examine the extent to which they are able to balance democratic function with effective programme delivery. We show that the limited capacity of local government to reach out to rural areas promotes heavy competition between cooperatives for government programmes, resulting in a highly skewed distribution of benefits determined primarily by how effectively each can 'reach up' to local service providers to secure them. This encourages cooperatives to elect powerful actors to represent them because they are perceived to have the greater political 'connectedness' required to access these benefits. However, these powerful actors are often less accountable to membership and therefore more likely to disburse benefits to suit their own vested interests. We suggest that, under current conditions, the process of creating effective and legitimate cooperatives must balance strong leadership with a high degree of accountability and transparency to ensure that benefits are disbursed as widely and appropriately as possible to members. Separating executive, judicial and legislative power structures associated with the securing and disbursement of resources to ensure processes are transparent, might be the most practical way of achieving this. Ultimately, if the capacity of the state is strengthened to enable them to 'reach down' to cooperatives more effectively, the need to vest leadership in powerful actors and risk compromising accountability and egalitarian service delivery, might be reduced.

TI  - Effects of land fragmentation on the governance of the commons: Theory and evidence from 284 villages and 17 provinces in China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The extant literature on the commons describes a large number of factors that could explain the drama of the commons or why some commons are managed well but others are not. However, little is known about the effects of land fragmentation on the governance of the commons. This question is important for developing countries, especially China where land holdings are highly fragmented with farmers having on average 4.127 plots of land. We employ ordered probit and step wise regression based on data from a survey of 3895 households from 284 villages in 17 provinces or regions in China. We find, consistent with theoretical expectation, that land fragmentation has a negative and significant effect on collective action and the governance of the commons. Farmers with more plots of land are more likely to free ride and less likely to contribute to collective action. Our findings have important implications for the governance of the commons specially in developing countries.

TI  - Enhancing competitiveness of Zimbabwe's cotton production under contract farming
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study was designed to assess the competitiveness of cotton production by smallholder farmers under contract farming in Zimbabwe and propose strategies for enhancing sector performance. Data were collected from secondary sources, key informant interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs). A multiple criteria analysis (MCA) was used to identify key constraints in cotton production. Cotton budgets were developed and a policy analysis matrix (PAM) was derived to assess the competitiveness of cotton farming. Key constraints identified were related to policy and institutional failure. Cotton production was found to be not competitive with an overall disincentive of USD-132.30/ha of cotton produced. The nominal protection coefficient output (NPCO) of 0.75 and nominal protection coefficient input (NPCI) of 1.5 indicate taxation in the product and factor markets respectively. The effective protection coefficient (EPC) of 0.5 indicates that the operating environment does not encourage production. To sustain cotton farming under contract farming, there is a need to strengthen private and public institutions to reduce behavioural uncertainties. Alternatively, financing of cotton production might need remodelling to incentivise banks to finance farmers directly through group lending and government guaranteed funding. Human capital development through farmer training programmes is recommended to enhance farm productivity.

TI  - To sell or store? Assessing smallholder farmers' willingness to pay for potato cold storage in Kenya
T2  - FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY
AB  - Storage of food commodities for some time after harvest can play an important role in alleviating the downside of price fluctuations in developing countries. While storage can offer smallholder farmers substantial inter-temporal arbitrage opportunities, existing evidence shows that many farmers in developing countries store little of their harvest. Using a cross sectional survey of 502 households in Nyandarua and Bomet Counties of Kenya, this paper assessed smallholder farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) for cold storage and compares their WTP with the arbitrage opportunities. Our results reveal that the storage of potato was generally limited with only 26% storing in the season preceding the study. Using a hypothetical scenario with double-bounded contingent valuation formats, our findings show that a considerable proportion of households (70.7%) were willing to rent cold storage facilities. The WTP for storing a 90 kg bag of Shangi, a common variety with a short shelf life (1 month) was Kenya shillings (KES) 104 (1.16/kg/month) compared KES 96.4 (1.07/kg/month) for the Unica variety (slightly longer shelf life). The probit model results show that gender (being female), and transaction costs associated with access to markets (e.g., geographical location and distance to the road) were positively associated with WTP. Furthermore, household endowment, reflected in household expenditure, income and level of potato commercialization had a positive influence on WTP to store. In addition, institutional characteristics of collective action, previous experience with storage and use of certified seed (often associated with extension) enhanced households WTP for potato storage. The results on potato prices over a 5-year period (2014-2019) show that seasonal price gaps were higher than the estimated WTP, suggesting that potato storage could be economically viable. These findings have significant policy implications not only for commodities whose harvest is perishable and season bound (e.g., vegetables, fruits) where arbitrage may offer price stabilization.

TI  - Farmer-led Seed Enterprise Initiatives to Access Certified Seed for Traditional African Vegetables and its Effect on Incomes in Tanzania
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Farmers need access to certified seed stocks for efficient production of traditional African vegetable seed. However, access to quality certified seed is constrained by several factors. Primary data from four selected regions of Tanzania was analyzed to examine the causal linkages among traditional African vegetable farmers' decisions to participate in farmer-led seed enterprises and their access to quality certified seeds. The effect of farmers' access to certified traditional African vegetable seed on revenue generated from their seed sales in the study locale was assessed. This study concludes that farmers' revenue from traditional vegetable seed sales is positively and significantly influenced by access to certified seed. Indeed, access to certified seed can be increased, if farmers participate in farmer-led seed enterprises, and if they have more frequent contact with village extensionists. Relevant policy actions and recommendations for improving farmer-led seed enterprises are offered.

TI  - Benefits and pitfalls of social capital for farmer cooperatives: evidence from China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - This paper conducts an exploratory analysis on the role of social capital in influencing both economic and social performance of farmer cooperatives based on a sample of 156 farmers from 54 vegetable cooperatives in China's Hebei and Zhejiang provinces. Social capital is distinguished into bonding and bridging dimensions, with the former referring to the internal aspect of social capital and the latter the external "Guanxi" (meaning relationship) possessed by core members. The statistical results display that specific dimensions of social capital may not deliver the benefits expected by cooperative practitioners and academics. Both positive and negative effects of social capital on performances of farmer cooperatives are observed. To be specific, bonding social capital is positively associated with common members' economic benefits. Bridging social capital generates beneficial outcomes for the financial and social performances of cooperatives, while exhibiting negative influence on common members' income increase because of member heterogeneity.

TI  - Trend of disparity between coastland and inland in medical expenditure burden for rural inpatients with malignant tumor in southeast of China from 2007 to 2016
T2  - BMC CANCER
AB  - BackgroundNew Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) was developed to improve the health security for rural residents. This study aimed to assess the trend of disparity between coastland and inland in medical expenditure burden for rural inpatients with malignant tumor from 2007 to 2016 under the effect of NRCMS.MethodsThe data from medical records of 1,306,895 patients with malignant tumor who had NRCMS in 2932 hospitals was collected. The relative differences [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] between coastland and inland in four medical expense indicators were calculated using generalized linear models to assess the trend of disparity over time.ResultsIn total, there were 769,484 (58.88%) coastland patients and 537,411 (41.12%) inland patients. Male and patients aged older than 44years accounted for 56.87 and 80% of 1,306,895 patients, respectively. After adjusting for gender, age, tumor site and hospital level, coastland patients had higher hospitalization expenses which were all medical expenses incurred during the hospitalization, lower reimbursement ratio and ratio of out-of-pocket expenses to disposable income than inland patients in most years. The surgery expenses of coastland patients were lower than those of inland patients in 2016. The relative differences (95% CIs) between coastland and inland in medical expense indicators were moving closer to 1.0 from 2007 to 2010 among patients without surgery, implying that the disparity between two areas significantly narrowed. The range of change was similar between two areas from 2011 to 2016 whether among patients without or with surgery, implying that the disparity did not significantly change. The disparity between coastland and inland depended on the household income situation. For low-income patients, the differences between two areas in medical expense indicators were not statistically significance in most cases and the disparity between two areas did not significantly change over time.ConclusionsUnder the effect of NRCMS, the medical expenditure burden of rural inpatients reduced but suffering from malignant tumor was still catastrophic. As a whole, the inland patients had heavier medical expenditure burden than coastland patients. Because of economic factors and medical assistance policies, the medical expenditure burden was similar between coastland and inland low-income patients.

TI  - How do Forest Owners' Risk Preferences Affect Harvesting Decisions? A Case-study in Fujian Province, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST ECONOMICS
AB  - Collective forests in China are the major source of the nation's wood supply, and therefore understanding the harvesting decisions of the small-scale forest owners who manage them is crucial to realizing national forest production goals. However, forest owners' timber harvesting decisions depend very much on individual attitudes toward risks and benefits (i.e., risk preferences), but this topic has received very little research attention. In this paper, we applied prospect theory and lottery experiments to measure individuals' risk preferences. In 2018, 320 household questionnaires were combined with a field experiment in Fujian Province, China, to empirically determine the link between risk preferences and timber harvesting behavior. The results indicate that the higher the degree of risk aversion the forest owners have, the more they are willing to harvest forests under household management, as well as the earlier they are inclined to harvest. However, the harvesting amount per mu of risk-averse forest owners are lower than risk-neutral or risk-taking households due to lower investment in their forestlands. Further analysis indicates that improving forest owners' forestland tenure security is helpful to reduce forest owners' risk-avoiding behaviors. This study contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between household risk preference and timber harvesting behavior, and will help inform the design of alternative policies that could reduce forest management risks.

TI  - Beyond subsistence: the aggregate contribution of campesinos to the supply and conservation of native maize across Mexico
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Mexico is the center of domestication and a center for diversity of maize. Area planted with maize is the country's largest agricultural land use, mostly planted by smallholder family farmers known as campesinos. They generally plant native varieties, saving and sharing seed by and among themselves, enabling the evolutionary processes that sustain and generate crop genetic diversity to continue today. Campesinos have been viewed as largely subsistence farmers generating limited maize surpluses. Here, we show that subsistence production is insufficient for explaining the quantity of maize they produce and the extent of the area they plant across Mexico. Our hypothesis is that beyond supplying their own consumption needs, campesinos collectively produce maize to respond to the demand of non-maize producing local consumers. We quantify the extent of subsistence versus surplus production among campesinos, showing that they produce more maize than would be needed to feed themselves and generate substantial surpluses. We test statistically the association between the area campesinos plant with maize across the country with socioeconomic variables that link their production to the demand by other consumers, and examine the implications of the results for the supply and conservation of native maize in the country. Our results suggest that maize trading linking campesinos to other consumers may be important and widespread, contributing to create additional incentives beyond self-consumption to plant native varieties from saved seed. We conclude that there are important opportunities for maintaining maize evolution under domestication at large scale by strengthening local maize markets.

TI  - Institutional and governance factors influencing the performance of selected smallholder agricultural cooperatives in KwaZulu-Natal
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - This paper evaluates the impact of institutional and governance factors on the performance of 10 smallholder agricultural cooperatives in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). Five of the cooperatives grow and market vegetables, three produce and market poultry, one is a beef production cooperative and another operates a bakery. The results of a cluster analysis suggest that the performance of the selected smallholder cooperatives is influenced by institutional and governance problems. Institutional problems give rise to low levels of equity and debt capital, reliance on government funding, low levels of investment, and subsequent loss of members. Governance problems are strongly linked to the absence of secret ballot, low levels of education, lack of production and management skills training, weak marketing arrangements and consequent low returns to members as patrons or investors. The conclusion is that appropriate institutional arrangements and good governance are important to the performance of enterprises initiated by groups of smallholders. South Africa's new Cooperatives Act prevents smallholder cooperatives from adopting good institutional arrangements. Alternative ownership structures such as close corporations and private companies offer better institutional arrangements and opportunities for equity-sharing partnerships.

TI  - Farm size and production efficiency in Chinese agriculture: output and profit
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between farm size and agricultural production efficiency from the aspects of output and profit in order to find an optimal farm size that achieves both output and profit efficiency in agricultural production in China.
   Design/methodology/approach This study uses the 2012 China Family Panel Studies survey data and employs the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) models to investigate empirically the relationship between farm size and agricultural production efficiency.
   Findings The study finds that there is an inverted-U curve relationship between farm size and output efficiency and a U-shaped curve relationship between farm size and profit efficiency in agricultural production in China. Based on the empirical results, the study estimates that the appropriate farm size is around 10-40mu and the optimal farm size is around 20-40mu both in terms of output efficiency and profit efficiency in Chinese agricultural production under the current agricultural technology and land management system.
   Practical implications The findings of this study suggest that appropriate land consolidation will bring more benefits to farmer households and agricultural production efficiency. There are some policy implications. First, governments should give long term and more stable land using rights to farmers through extending the period of land contract and verifying land using rights. Second, governments should encourage transfers of land using rights and promote land consolidation. But the implementation of this policy should consider regional differences and not be used for blindly pursuing increasing land size. Third, land consolidation should be accompanied with the development of specialized agricultural services.
   Originality/value The paper makes two major contributions to the literature. First, the authors use the SFA model to investigate the relationship between land size and agricultural production efficiency. Second, the authors establish two SFA models - the stochastic frontier output analysis model and the stochastic frontier profit analysis model - to estimate the optimal land size to achieve both output and profit efficiency of agricultural production in China.

TI  - Tobacco Farming Following Land Reform in Zimbabwe: A New Dynamic of Social Differentiation and Accumulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - Tobacco has been central to the agrarian economy of Zimbabwe since the early 1900s, when it became the backbone of the new settler economy following colonisation. Since the land reform of 2000, tobacco has taken on a new impetus, with production now often exceeding that generated by white commercial farming in the 1990s. Today, tobacco is being produced predominantly by smallholders, with those on resettlement land being especially important. Tobacco production is supported by a range of buying companies, auction houses, transporters and contract arrangements, and small-scale farmers are thus tightly connected to a global commodity chain. This article explores tobacco production in A1 (smallholder) resettlement schemes in Mvurwi area, Mazowe district, a high-potential area to the north of Harare. The article is based on a combination of surveys and in-depth interviews with farmers carried out between 2017 and 2019. The article explores who are the winners and losers in the changing dynamics of smallholder tobacco production in these land reform sites and how different groups of farmers combine tobacco with other crops and with off-farm enterprises. Drawing on a simple typology of producers derived from the analysis of survey data from 310 A1 farmers, we examine the role of tobacco in complex patterns of accumulation and social differentiation, looking at class, gender and age dynamics. The conclusion discusses how the tobacco boom is reshaping the agrarian economy and its underlying social relations. This is a highly dynamic setting, influenced by how tobacco production is incorporated into farming systems, how its production is financed, how and where it is marketed and how it is combined with other crops and other income-earning opportunities.

TI  - ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE SEED SECTOR OF RICE IN GUINEA: STAKEHOLDERS, PERCEPTION AND INSTITUTIONAL LINKAGES
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
AB  - This paper analyses the organization of the rice seed sector in Guinea with the overall objectives to assess how organizational settings affect seed supply to small-scale farmers and to suggest institutional changes that would favour seed service and uptake of varieties. Data were collected in Guinea, West Africa, using focus group discussions with extension workers, farmers, representatives of farmers' associations, agro-input dealers, researchers and non-governmental organization (NGO) staff and surveys of 91 rice farming households and 41 local seed dealers. Findings suggest that the current institutional settings and perceptions of stakeholders from the formal seed sector inhibit smallholder farmers' access to seed. Seed interventions in the past two decades have mainly relied on the national extension system, the research institute, NGOs, farmers' associations and contract seed producers to ensure seed delivery. Although local seed dealers play a central role in providing seed to farmers, governmental organizations operating in a linear model of formal seed sector development have so far ignored their role. We discuss the need to find common ground and alternative models of seed sector development. In particular we suggest the involvement of local seed dealers in seed development activities to better link the formal and the informal seed systems and improve smallholder farmers' access to seed from the formal sector.

TI  - Improved energy efficiency of farmers' cooperative litchi drying operation in Northern Thailand
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - In 2007, Hmong farmers growing litchi in the mountainous region of Northern Thailand started to dry the fruit in response to its declining market price. However, the locally available dryer, although affordable and of a size appropriate for smallholder farmers' cooperatives, showed excessive gas consumption, and this, along with rising fuel costs, imposed a threat to the drying operation. The objective of this study was to test low-cost, easy-to-implement modifications to a locally available convection dryer, to improve its energy efficiency. Experiments were conducted in cooperation with a Hmong farmers' cooperative in Northern Thailand. Insulation of the air ducts and control of the air recirculation rate led to energy cost savings of US$2.45 per dryer-load. With the modifications required being simple, the investment needed was recovered after only approximately 20 loads, while the energy efficiency of the dryer increased from 33% to 39%.

TI  - Peri-Urbanism in Globalizing India: A Study of Pollution, Health and Community Awareness
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - This paper examines the intersection between environmental pollution and people's acknowledgements of, and responses to, health issues in Karhera, a former agricultural village situated between the rapidly expanding cities of New Delhi (India's capital) and Ghaziabad (an industrial district in Uttar Pradesh). A relational place-based view is integrated with an interpretive approach, highlighting the significance of place, people's emic experiences, and the creation of meaning through social interactions. Research included surveying 1788 households, in-depth interviews, participatory mapping exercises, and a review of media articles on environment, pollution, and health. Karhera experiences both domestic pollution, through the use of domestic waste water, or gandapani, for vegetable irrigation, and industrial pollution through factories' emissions into both the air and water. The paper shows that there is no uniform articulation of any environment/health threats associated with gandapani. Some people take preventative actions to avoid exposure while others do not acknowledge health implications. By contrast, industrial pollution is widely noted and frequently commented upon, but little collective action addresses this. The paper explores how the characteristics of Karhera, its heterogeneous population, diverse forms of environmental pollution, and broader governance processes, limit the potential for citizen action against pollution.

TI  - Determinants of child morbidity and factors governing utilization of child health care: evidence from rural India
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - Prevention as well as effective treatment of respiratory infections and diarrhoea depends on several individual, household and community level factors. The objective of this article is to estimate the role played by such factors in determining the occurrence of such diseases and utilization of formal health care for children under the age of three in India. The major findings are briefly enlisted as follows. First, a woman with greater educational qualification and autonomy in terms of her power to take decisions on her own, control over household resources and complete freedom to move beyond the confines of her household exerts a significant influence on the probability of seeking care. In addition to this, formal care is more likely to be sought for children whose mothers are more exposed to the media. Programmes devised to enhance utilization of formal health care for children should be targeted to catering for the needs of the vulnerable group i.e. female child, predominantly, residing in households belonging to Scheduled Tribe. In addition to this, children belonging to Muslim households are at higher risk of contracting the diseases but there is no significant difference in their health seeking behaviour as compared to other religious groups.

TI  - Can the reform of integrating health insurance reduce inequity in catastrophic health expenditure? Evidence from China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB  - Background China's fragmentation of social health insurance schemes has become a key obstacle that hampers equal access to health care and financial protection. This study aims to explores if the policy intervention Urban and Rural Residents Basic Medical Insurance (URRBMI) scheme, which integrates Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) and New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS), can curb the persistent inequity of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and further analyses the determinants causing inequity. Methods Data were derived from the Fifth National Health Service Survey (NHSS). A total of 11,104 households covered by URRBMI and 20,590 households covered by URBMI or NCMS were selected to analyze CHE and the impoverishment rate from medical expenses. Moreover, the decomposition method based on a probit model was employed to analyse factors contributing CHE inequity. Results The overall incidence of CHE under integrated insurance scheme was 15.53%, about 1.10% higher than the non-integrated scheme; however, the intensity of CHE and impoverishment among the poorest was improved. Although CHE was still concentrated among the poor under URRBMI (CI = -0.53), it showed 28.38% lower in the degree of inequity. For URRBMI households, due to the promotion of integration reform to the utilization of rural residents' better health services, the factor of residence (24.41%) turns out to be a major factor in increasing inequity, the factor of households with hospitalized members (- 84.53%) played a positive role in reducing inequity and factors related to social economic status also contributed significantly in increasing inequity. Conclusion The progress made in the integrated URRBMI on CHE equity deserves recognition, even though it did not reduce the overall CHE or the impoverishment rate effectively. Therefore, for enhanced equity, more targeted solutions should be considered, such as promoting more precise insurance intervention for the most vulnerable population and including costly diseases suitable for outpatient treatment into benefit packages. Additionally, comprehensive strategies such as favourable targeted benefit packages or job creation are required for the disadvantaged.

TI  - Which smallholders are willing to adopt Acacia mangium under long-term contracts? Evidence from a choice experiment study in Indonesia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Smallholder ownership of forests has grown rapidly over the last 25 years, leading to global forest transition; however, incentives are required to keep smallholders growing trees under long-term afforestation contracts. This article reports on smallholders' willingness to join afforestation programs, growing Acacia mangium under contract on their private farmland. In a Choice Experiment, we examine the effects of policy attributes of afforestation contracts, including contract duration, labour participation, timber insurance, training opportunities, road improvement, and expected income. We report the marginal value of changes in monetary terms. A scale-extended latent class model was used to analyse preference heterogeneity in data of 323 smallholders from three different regions in Indonesia (West Kalimantan, Yogyakarta, and South Sumatera). These regions are at different forest transition stages. Our results indicate that there are four latent preference classes, which value attributes of the contract differently. Individual characteristics (risk orientation, tree growing experiences, and occupation), and regional differences explain the probability of preference class membership. Our findings have important implications for enhancing afforestation strategies that improve social welfare of smallholders in various forest transition stages.

TI  - Hydropatriarchies and landesque capital: a local gender contract analysis of two smallholder irrigation systems in East Africa
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Water is a natural resource whose control for productive purposes is often in the hands of men. Societies grounded on such unequal gender relations have been defined hydropatriarchies'. Against this background, this paper presents a gender analysis of landscape investments, conceptualised as landesque capital in smallholder irrigation farming in East Africa. Based on the analysis of how local gender contracts are negotiated, I argue that as processes of landesque capital formation are often explicitly gendered, attentiveness to gender dynamics is required to fully understand such practices. Moreover, as investments in landesque capital, for example, irrigation, terracing and drainage systems, have primarily been conceptualised as the result of men's systematic work, this study highlights women's contributions to the creation of landesque capital, taking smallholder irrigation as an example. Findings show that a distinction between incremental' and systematic' change (Doolittle 1984; Annals of the Association of American Geographers 74 124-37) is central to understanding the gender dynamics of landesque capital investment, but it is not sufficient. As women's work processes are typically not systematic, possibly promoting incremental change, they contribute to the production of landesque capital by supporting and facilitating men's work. However, the work of women is, as a rule, homogenised and stereotypically rendered as reproductive and secondary, due to the underlying cultural norms that limit, control or exploit women. This conceptualisation, or rather lack of, I argue, risks leading to a gender-blind analysis of land use intensification processes. Building on the gendered and symbolic nature of landesque capital, I propose a local gender contract analysis that integrates the cultural, symbolic and physical dimensions of the local gender division of labour into agricultural work and landscape change processes.

TI  - Gender differences in farmers' livelihood capital in Dazu District, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study aims to investigate whether there are gender differences in the livelihood capital of farming households in China. A stratified random sampling technique and household surveys were used to collect data from Dazu District, China. This paper uses capital values to compute the level of livelihood capital, while the ordinary least squares model is employed to compare gender differences in livelihood capital. The results show significant gender differences in farmers' livelihood capital. Male farmers have more livelihood capital than female farmers. There are also significant gender differences in the factors that affect farmers' livelihood capital. Education and agricultural cooperatives are the major factors influencing the livelihood capital of men, while agricultural policy support and happiness are the major factors influencing the livelihood capital of women. These results imply that specific gender-based intervention programs should be implemented to maintain farmers' livelihood sustainability and to overcome gender gaps in agriculture.

TI  - Seeking Safety: Avoiding Displacement and Choosing Destinations in Civil Wars
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
AB  - Despite civil war violence, some civilians stay in their communities. Those who leave choose one of many possible destinations. Drawing on fieldwork in Colombia, this article argues that the way armed groups target civilians explains households' decisions about displacement. When groups of civilians are targeted based on a shared characteristic - 'collective' targeting - their best options for avoiding violence differ from those targeted selectively or indiscriminately. This article outlines conditions under which people can stay in contexts of collective targeting, and where they are likely to go if these conditions are not met. A civilian facing collective targeting could move to a rival group's stronghold, cluster with others similarly targeted, or seek anonymity in a city or different region. Community characteristics, such as whether it is urban or rural, as well as macro characteristics of the war, such as whether or not there is an ascriptive cleavage, shape which decisions are relatively safest, which in turn leads to implications for aggregate patterns. For example, clustering together has a perverse effect: even though hiding among others with similar characteristics may reduce an individual's likelihood of suffering direct violence, the community may be more endangered as it is perceived to be affiliated with an armed group. This then leads to a cycle of collective targeting and displacement, which has important implications for the development of warfare. In turn, this cycle and related cleavage formation may have long-term impacts on postwar stability and politics.

AB  - This study explores the implications of supermarket expansion in the developing world for actors, particularly small-scale farmers, along the supply chains, by examining a case from Thailand. Supermarkets exert Monopsonistic power by pushing a range of processing and marketing costs on to suppliers and instituting a short-term tendering process among suppliers. The scale of the farming operation is not a barrier to entering the chain, but important financial and social capital investments are necessary. Returns compared to traditional farming can be high, and appear sustainable at least in the medium term.

TI  - Adaptive capacity of farming systems to climate change in Iran: Application of composite index approach
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - CONTEXT: Climate change is expected to adversely affect agricultural production, particularly in Iran where the agricultural sector forms the backbone of the economy. This is true for the agriculture sector of the southwest region of Iran which is largely rain-fed and dominated by smallholder farmers with minimal livelihood alter-natives. Although several studies have been conducted on climate change, little has been done on the adaptive capacity of farmers within farming systems, especially in Iran.OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to evaluate the adaptive capacity of four common farming systems (i.e., family farming system, cooperative farming system, commercialized farming system, and agro-enterprise farming system) in Fars province, southwestern Iran.METHODS: A seven-step approach was used to normalize, weigh, and aggregate 102 individual indicators within a composite adaptive capacity index that is dimensionless, ranging from 0 to 1, and 1 is the optimal value. The required data were collected using a cross-sectional survey from 1472 farmers within the four mentioned farming systems.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the highest value was recorded by agro-enterprise for knowledge, perception and awareness, transport and physical accessibility, and institution and economic resources. Agro-enterprise scored higher in terms of awareness and action, which shows that these farming systems have a higher capacity for adaptation to the threat posed by climate diversity. Farmers in this farming system benefit from high formal education, high perceptions about the threat and risk of climate change, the occurrence of climatic events, causes for the change in climatic parameters, and awareness of climate change impactsSIGNIFICANCE: This paper recommends resilience-building interventions in the study area, which target in-dividuals with low adaptive capacities, especially farmers. The results can also assist agricultural policymakers to recognize which components and determinants of adaptive capacity should be prioritized to mitigate the threat of climate change to farming systems.

TI  - Data Driven Road Map for Doubling Income of Farmers of India
T2  - STATISTICS AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - The target of doubling income of farmers of India would be achieved only if inclusiveness of all sections is ensured. Government policies / initiatives, which aim to optimize the 3 factors of "laagat", "upaj" and "mulya", need to be reviewed, restructured and prioritized based on reliable primary and secondary sources. This study aims to analyse the situation of agricultural households based on data of National Sample Survey and other secondary sources as well as review corresponding initiatives / interventions of Government based on existing research works. The study concludes that the 7 areas of digitalization of land records and liberalization of land leasing & tenancy laws, effective Crop insurance, Assured micro irrigation techniques, Timely and regular holistic technical advice, Reforms in APMC act, open market, and Community and cooperative farming can prove to be an effective road map for doubling income of farmers in India.

TI  - Assessing health-related quality of life of patients with colorectal cancer using EQ-5D-5L: a cross-sectional study in Heilongjiang of China
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Aim This study aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and its determinants.
   Methods A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted on 300 newly diagnosed patients with CRC in China's Heilongjiang province, measuring HRQoL using the EuroQol five-dimension five-level (EQ-5D-5L). Kruskal-Wallis analyses were performed to identify the independent variables associated with the EQ-5D-5L utility scores. Predictors of the utility scores were confirmed using a Tobit regression model.
   Results The respondents had a mean EQ-5D-5L utility score of 0.617 (SD=0.371) and a median of 0.740 (range: -0.348 to 1.000). Pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression were major concerns of the respondents, with a prevalence of over 60% (all levels inclusive). The Kruskal-Wallis analyses found lower utility scores in those who were not married, worked as a farmer, enrolled with the new rural cooperative medical scheme and had lower household income (p<0.05). Those who were at a later stage of CRC, underwent surgical only therapy and had a stoma also had lower EQ-5D-5L scores than others (p<0.05). The Tobit regression model confirmed these predictors, except for occupation and marital status.
   Conclusion Patients with CRC have poor HRQoL, with pain/discomfort and depression/anxiety as the most frequently reported problems. The poor HRQoL is associated with the seriousness of the disease condition, as well as the low socioeconomic status of the patients.

TI  - Contract farming, social trust, and cleaner production behavior: field evidence from broiler farmers in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Pollution from livestock and poultry is the main source of rural pollution, which directly affects the rural ecological environment as well as the quality and safety of agricultural products. Based on field experiment data on broiler farmers in China, this paper analyzes farmers' cleaner production behavior from the perspective of incomplete contracts and social trust. We find that social trust can promote farmers' cleaner production behavior. Moreover, our evidence suggests that contract farming (CF) has a significant positive effect on farmers' social trust and cleaner production behaviors. Further analysis indicates that CF not only directly promotes farmers' cleaner production, but can also indirectly promote farmers' cleaner production by improving their interpersonal trust and institutional trust. Overall, this paper offers a new point of view for improving the rural environment and sheds light upon how the government can formulate relevant policies to promote farmers' cleaner production behavior.

TI  - Participatory variety selection in the Ethiopian cereal tef (Eragrostis tef)
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
AB  - Participatory variety selection (PVS) was carried Out ill two of the major tef-growing woredas (districts) of Ethiopia, Ada and Akaki, in 2003 and 2004. The objectives were to identify farmers' selection criteria, to increase farmers' awareness and their access to improved tef varieties, to enable farmers to assess the performances of improved tef varieties of their choice and to accelerate seed dissemination of farmers' chosen varieties through farmer-to-farmer exchange mechanisms. Seed colour was the overriding selection criterion. Farmers overwhelmingly selected the very white seed variety DZ-01-196 (Magna) for market purposes, indicating that tef is a cash crop. Farmers also selected brown-seeded tef. but for home Consumption. There was no evidence of connection between seed colour and desirable agronomic traits, or nutritional quality (protein content). Factors other than seed-colour Were of secondary concern to farmers. When market demands become the dominant selection criteria, PVS Should not be all end by itself: rather. it complements the formal breeding system. The results imply that tef performance evaluation trials need to be separated oil a colour-group basis, and any new successful variety in the two woredas should be superior to DZ-01-196 not only in grain yield but also in seed-colour quality. A faster. more efficient and reliable pure-seed supply system than the traditional farmer-to-farmer exchange mechanism is required ill order for farmers to continue planting improved varieties, which might be better achieved through small-scale commercial producers and/or cooperatives.

TI  - Knowledge, attitude and practice of pesticide use and serum cholinesterase levels among rice farmers in Nakhon Nayok Province, Thailand
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose - The study purposes were to investigate the knowledge, attitude and practice of pesticide use and to determine the levels of serum cholinesterase among rice farmers in Nakhon Nayok province, Thailand.
   Design/methodology/approach - Across-sectional study was carried out in communities in Nakhon Nayok Province, Thailand. Multistage random sampling was employed, selecting one person per each rice farmer household. Data was collected from 188 rice farmers using a structured face-to-face interview questionnaire. A reactive-paper finger-blood test was used to determine SChE levels. Chi-square test was used to determine the relationship between the practice of pesticide use and SChE levels.
   Findings - The results indicated that the rice farmers had a fairly good knowledge and a neutral attitude toward the practice of pesticide use. Most of the respondents had a fairly proper practice of pesticide use. However, serum cholinesterase levels of the farmers were unsafe and risky. It signified that 68.1% of the farmers had a health risk from using pesticides. The prevalence of abnormal SChE levels among rice farmers with improper use was significantly higher than that among rice farmers who had a proper use.
   Research limitations/implications - The result provided a guideline for operational planning and control and prevention of health effects from pesticides use in farmers or other agriculturists who use pesticides in cultivation.
   Practical implications - Concerned local agencies especially health-related agencies are able to conduct a training to educate and build safety awareness including monitoring continuously the safety behaviors toward pesticides use. It can be implemented by establishing leaders from health promoting hospitals led by village health volunteers, community leaders and participation from farmers to collaboratively monitor proper use of pesticides beginning with health surveillance in the abnormal SChE group to be screened for pesticide exposure every six months or one year.
   Social implications - Farmers gained knowledge and understanding of pesticides use and used it properly, which resulted in a reduction of pesticide residues in body as well as in the environment. In addition, the government policy should legislate measures for related agencies to promote proper use of pesticides. For instance, Department of Agriculture, Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives should regularly supervise, monitor and inspect the production and distribution of pesticides in local shops and also systematically encourage agriculturists to adopt using pesticides that are less harmful.
   Originality/value - Having knowledge, understanding and proper practices toward pesticides use, farmers can reduce health effects of pesticides use in themselves and family members.

TI  - Impact of property rights reform on household forest management investment: An empirical study of southern China
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Since the early 1980s, China has initiated a series of property rights reforms in the collectively owned forest area to motivate farmers in forest management. Assessment of farmers' behaviors in response to the reforms would be useful when policy adjustments are considered. This paper investigated farmers' participation and investment using labor and money input in forest management as indicators. The data were collected in Tonggu County in southern China. Results indicate that positive attitudes toward the reforms and higher income from forest product sales encourage participation in forest management. In contrast, higher off-farm income would hold back their participation and investment. It was also found that farmers who owned more land and are more confident to get logging quota would manage their forests more intensively. Households having elder and more educated household heads appear less interested in investment in forest management. Some policy implications are presented in this paper. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Smallholder Farmer Adoption of Climate-Related Adaptation Strategies: The Importance of Vulnerability Context, Livelihood Assets, and Climate Perceptions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Despite increased research characterizing the adaptive capacity of households and communities, there are few empirical studies that test why farmers adopt costly climate-related adaptive strategies, which strategies are implemented, and farmers' perceptions of climate changes. In this study, we analyzed determinants for smallholder farmer adoption of adaptation strategies in Chiapas, Mexico. We conducted 291 surveys with landowners in eight coffee farming communities. Farmers were asked which of 21 adaptation strategies they had engaged in, within five categories: migration, storage, land use diversification, community investment, and market exchange. We found the most frequent strategies included planting shade coffee, diversifying crop varieties, shifting sow date, building living walls, reforesting, or engaging in soil conservation. Although many farmers have experienced natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes, they were most concerned by long-term threats to crops like coffee rust and higher temperatures, that require costly adaptive investments. We find farmers adapt to climate events because of their vulnerability context (i.e., experience with disasters and distance to markets). Land holdings (i.e., natural capital), farm equipment (i.e., physical capital), and group membership (i.e., social capital), were also key factors influencing adaptation. Finally, farmers with strong perceptions of drought and temperature change were most likely to adapt. These results suggest policy makers should have a multi-pronged approach to: improve farmers' resource base through explicitly promoting adaptation strategies like crop and income diversification; inform climate perceptions through workshops on climate and weather; and strengthen participation in community and producer organizations to increase smallholder adaptation.

TI  - Effects of Socioeconomic Conditions on Multiple Uses of Swamp Forests in Central Brazil
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
AB  - Local communities in central Brazil harvest buriti palm (Mauritia flexuosa) fruit from swamp forests as well as using them for agriculture and cattle and pig farming. This study describes the intensity of forest use by buriti fruit harvesters and identifies how their socioeconomic conditions influence resource use. We visited 75 swamp forests where buriti fruits are harvested and interviewed the head of the nearest household. Agriculture was practiced in 72 % of forests and cattle farming in 52 %. For almost half (48 %) of households agriculture and buriti fruit harvest were the main sources income. Forests resources were equally important to all socioeconomic classes, even richer farmers. The intensity of fruit harvest did not differ between collective and private use regimes of forests. Market access was a limitation to fruit harvest intensity. The high intensity of swamp forest use suggests that their conservation will require change to current management practices.

TI  - CREDIT AND LAND CONTRACTING: A TEST OF THE THEORY OF SHARECROPPING
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Choice of a share vs. fixed rent land rental contract has figured prominently in the theory of industrial organization. This theory tells us that, while a share contract is inefficient in a first-best world, it may be the preferred option under second-best conditions. It has thus predicted the existence of sharecropping as the potentially preferred contract under conditions of liquidity constraint. Rigorous empirical evidence is, however, still lacking on this basic contribution of theory. We use a randomized experiment in a credit program for landless workers and marginal farmers organized by BRAC in Bangladesh to show that increased access to credit has a large positive effect on the choice of fixed rent over share rent contracts, both in terms of number of contracts and area contracted. As predicted by theory, the magnitude of this shift away from sharecropping is enhanced when the tenant is less exposed to risk. Development programs that facilitate access to credit to potential tenants can thus help them take more efficient land rental contracts.

TI  - Agrobiodiversity conservation with illegal-drug crops: An approach from the prisons in Oaxaca, Mexico*
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - Drawing on political-ecological vulnerability theory, this paper analyzes the impact of illegal-drug cultivation and its related violence on smallholder agrobiodiversity in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. Oaxaca is a global agrobiodiversity hotspot where cannabis and opium poppy have been widely cultivated for decades. The study is based on 76 structured/semi-structured interviews with imprisoned farmers, harvest gatherers, and former soldiers in four state prisons. Results show that illegal-drug crops and native-food crops complement each other until a threshold of violence is crossed, which leads to the abandonment of agriculture due to murder, imprisonment, and out-migration. The specialization of smallholder agriculture in illegal-drug crops tends to favor crossing the threshold of violence. In most municipalities in this study, however, rather a diversification process took place in which illegal-drug crops were incorporated to food production systems, reducing both the exposure and the sensitivity of smallholders to structural and direct violence. Other adaptation strategies involved local organization and militarization of smallholders for collective-risk management and territorial control. Ultimately, by comparing five vulnerability scenarios, this paper argues that the combination of peasant organization, militarization, and crop/livelihood diversification in Oaxaca mitigates the violent agrarian change associated with this illegal economy, while conserving agrobiodiversity.

TI  - Smallholder vegetable farmers in Northern Tanzania: Pesticides use practices, perceptions, cost and health effects
T2  - CROP PROTECTION
AB  - Smallholder farmers in Northern Tanzania grow vegetables that include tomatoes, cabbages and onions and use many types of pesticides to control pests and diseases that attack these crops. Based on the use of questionnaires and interviews that were conducted in Arumeru, Monduli, Karatu and Moshi rural districts, this study investigates farmers' practices, perceptions and related cost and health effects on vegetable pest management using pesticides. The types of pesticides used by the farmers in the study areas were insecticides (59%), fungicides (29%) and herbicides (10%) with the remaining 2% being rodenticides. Pesticides were bought from pesticides shops (60%), general shops (30%) and cooperative shops (10%). The pesticides were supplied in containers ranging from 0.5 to 51 or in packets ranging from 0.5 to 25 kg. Vendors often dispensed smaller quantities of pesticides in unlabelled containers. About a third of the farmers applied pesticides in mixtures. Up to 90% of this third had a maximum of 3 pesticides in a mixture. In all cases, there were no specific instructions either from the labels or extension workers regarding these tank mixtures. More than 50% of the respondents applied pesticides up to 5 times or more per cropping season depending on the crop. Insecticides and fungicides were routinely applied by 77% and 7%, respectively. Fifty-three percent of the farmers reported that the trend of pesticide use was increasing, while 33% was constant and 14% was decreasing. Sixty-eight percent of farmers reported having felt sick after routine application of pesticides. Pesticide-related health symptoms that were associated with pesticides use included skin problems and neurological system disturbances (dizziness, headache). Thirty-nine percent of farmers reported spending between 20 and 130,200 Tanzanian shillings (0.018-116 US dollars) in a year on health due to pesticides. These results will contribute to the reformation of pesticide policies for safe and effective use of pesticides by smallholder farmers in Tanzania. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Contextual and psychosocial factors influencing caregiver safe disposal of child feces and child latrine training in rural Odisha, India
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Child feces are an important source of fecal exposure in household environments. Typically, one of two behaviors is necessary to mitigate this risk: either caregivers dispose of their children's feces into a latrine or children learn how to use a latrine. Although past studies have examined factors associated with these two behaviors collectively (i.e. "safe disposal"), there is a need to separately analyze these distinctive practices to better inform programming. This study aims to quantitatively examine contextual and psychosocial factors influencing caregiver safe disposal and, separately, child latrine training. We surveyed 791 primary female caregivers, who reported on 906 children <5 years old, across 74 villages in rural Odisha, India. At their last defecation event, 38% of children used the latrine and another 10% had their feces safely disposed of into the latrine. Since caregiver safe disposal was rare, we instead assessed safe disposal intention. We used linear regression and multilevel mixed effects models to examine contextual and psychosocial factors. For contextual factors, we found caregivers had stronger safe disposal intention when they came from wealthier households and had greater informational support, but weaker intention when their latrine was near the household. Caregivers more intensely practiced latrine training with their child when they themselves used the latrine for defecation, the latrine was fully intact, and they had greater instrumental support. For psychosocial factors, caregivers had stronger safe disposal intention when their households expected them to practice safe disposal, they felt strongly committed to the behavior, and had a plan for what to do when faced with a water shortage. Caregivers more intensely taught their child how to use the latrine when they believed their child was at risk of becoming sick if they practiced open defecation (OD); viewed child OD as unbeneficial; liked teaching their child; personally felt it was important for the child's father to help; felt confident in their ability to teach their child; and had greater action control over their training practice. Interestingly, caregivers put less effort into latrine training when they felt more concerned for their child's safety when the child defecated outside. These findings underscore the critical need to separately assess unique child feces management (CFM) practices and also provide a road map for practitioners on the types of behavior change strategies to consider in their CFM programming.

TI  - Identification of pathways that lead to continuous or intermittent water supply by conducting a qualitative comparative analysis of rural water utilities in China
T2  - AQUA-WATER INFRASTRUCTURE ECOSYSTEMS AND SOCIETY
AB  - Ensuring a continuous water supply (CWS) for households is beneficial for the current global drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene agenda. Despite improvements in water supply, intermittent water supply (IWS) remains prevalent in rural areas. To determine the factors that lead to different water supply modes for villages, we select 38 village-level water utilities covered by the Chinese Safe Drinking Water Project for fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis to identify causal configurations ('pathways') that lead to IWS or CWS across systems. Six configurations of water supply mode are identified on the basis of the outcomes of each case. Among these, three configurations for adopting CWS are determined. Configuration 1 features water utility with government subsidy and bills using a water meter. Configuration 2 features water utility with small population coverage, government subsidy, and villager participation in the management. Configuration 3 features a water utility collectively managed and owned by a rich village and water-saving initiatives. Configurations that lack meter-based bills, government subsidies, and water-saving initiatives are the main paths for IWS. Results highlight the uniqueness of the configurational approach in understanding different water supply patterns across various cases and emphasise the importance of government subsidies, villager participation, water-saving programmes, and water meter-based billing to achieve CWS.

TI  - Efficiency and adoption of organic tea production: Evidence from Vi Xuyen district, Ha Giang province, Vietnam
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
AB  - This paper considers two empirical models. Initially, a stochastic frontier analysis is employed to investigate the technical efficiencies of tea growers in Vi Xuyen, Ha Giang. The findings indicate that the average technical efficiency of organic tea farmers in surveyed area was 65.2.1% which is lower than that of conventional tea growers (70.1%). Furthermore, the average age of tea plant has negative effect on technical efficiency of tea production, meanwhile, the remaining parameters have positive effects on the technical efficiency. Secondly, binary logistic regression analysis is used to determine the influencing factors of the tea farmer's choice on organic tea production. The variables such as cultivation land, access to extension services, experience of household's head and especially contract farming have large influences on the decision of tea farmers. The marginal effects after logit of the explanatory variables are -0.01, 0.63, -0.05, 0.71, respectively.

TI  - Of couscous and occupation: a case study of women's motivations to join and participate in Palestinian fair trade cooperatives
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - Economic opportunities and the status of women are mediated by socio-political structural factors, as well as cultural-specific norms and patterns of behavior. As consumers (and, in many cases, regulators) of resources at the household level, women are integral to the analysis of economic and political development. This paper examines the role of motivation and perception on women's participation in Palestinian Fair Trade projects. In the occupied Palestinian Territories, Fair Trade projects have been recently introduced by both international agencies and local Palestinian associations as means through which women can earn income, participate in cooperative leadership, and engage at economic and political levels. Current scholarship largely focuses on measuring outcomes of Fair Trade initiatives or the experiences of members after the implementation of a project. However, there is less understanding about factors influencing the recruitment and retention of members into these initiatives. This ethnographic account explores both the motivations of members to join several couscous (maftoul) Fair Trade cooperatives and the members' understanding Fair Trade goals and the cooperative structure. We examine four Palestinian women's maftoul cooperatives and their unique challenges and opportunities. This project highlights the lack of detail most women have about the global Fair Trade market, which has a potential to result in decreased recruitment and retention rates. This paper also examines the tensions between product quality and market demands existing within couscous cooperatives and the competing demands of child-care needs, household pressures, and military restrictions on Palestinian movement enforced by the Israeli military within the occupied Palestinian Territories.

TI  - To share or not to share? (Non-)violence, scarcity and resource access in Somali Region, Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - Scholars in the environmental security tradition have sought to explicate the links between environmental scarcity (or degradation) and the onset of different forms of political violence and how these are mediated by institutional mechanisms. The Malthusian trap here is not a direct deterministic relationship, but rather a possibility, where environmental scarcity when it coincides with socio-economic processes of rent-seeking and exclusion triggers political conditions ripe for violent struggles. This a priori attention to scarcity as causal mechanism blurs our understanding why violence occurs in some and does not in other places. Our research strategy is therefore different: we study a case of non-violent relations between resource users under conditions of environmental scarcity (due to drought) and political instability and look into the crucial role of local institutions in governing competing resource claims. Our case from the violence-prone Somali Region, Ethiopia analyses how agro-pastoralist communities develop sharing arrangements on pasture resources with intruding pastoralist communities in drought years, even though this places additional pressure on their grazing resource. A household survey investigates the determinants for different households in the agro-pastoralist community, asset-poor and wealthy ones, to enter into different types of sharing arrangements. Our findings suggest that resource sharing offers asset-poor households opportunities to stabilise and enhance their asset-base in drought years, providing incentives for cooperative rather than conflicting relations with intruding pastoralists.

TI  - Why are cluster farmers adopting more aquaculture technologies and practices? The role of trust and interaction within shrimp farmers' networks in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam
T2  - AQUACULTURE
AB  - A common avenue to enable adoption of technologies and practices by small-scale producers is by means of farmer clusters. These are achieved by building networks and partnerships between farmers and other actors within the supply chain. This paper examines the role that farmer clusters play in the adoption of practices and technologies by shrimp farmers in Vietnam. Understanding the decisions that lead to adoption is important because these have a key impact on sustainable land use in aquaculture. We report on two complementary studies that test the role of farmer clusters in accessing different sources of knowledge and the trust associated with each of the knowledge sources. First, a survey (N = 193) tested the relationship between cluster membership and adoption, and showed that shrimp farmers who are members of farmer clusters are more likely to adopt three types of pond management practices (i.e. water quality management, feed input, and disease control practices). Furthermore, frequency of interaction with, and trust related to, key stakeholder actors could partly explain this relationship. Second, focus group discussions further zoomed into the dynamics that underlie the adoption of technologies and practices by cluster farmers and non-cluster farmers, respectively. We found that input retailers, buyers and hatcheries were only valued for their input on specific products and issues, but not trusted, as the information always needed being verified through testing by, amongst others, neighbors. Consequently, trust relations with these actors can be described as strongly calculative. Farmer clusters increase trust and tighten relationships between members. As a result, members trust each other when verifying information or sharing knowledge acquired from less trusted sources. On the basis of these results, we argue that reliance on existing farmer networks (i.e. clusters) is a viable tool to improve adoption of sustainable technologies and achieve land use planning objectives. Further implications for research and policy are discussed.

TI  - Contract farming configuration: Smallholders' preferences for contract design attributes
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - While Contract Farming (CF) can enhance smallholders' income in developing countries, empirical research on the motivation of smallholders to participate in CF is scarce. This paper explores farmer preferences for particular contract design attributes. We combined analytical hierarchy process and discrete choice experiments to investigate the importance of contract design attributes. On the basis of data collected among potato farmers in Ethiopia, we found that input market uncertainty is more important than output market uncertainty in smallholders' decision to participate. Farmers tend to minimize their risk by opting for the buyer firm above the state and NGOs as providers of seed, inputs, and technical assistance. The results imply that the success of a CF scheme depends on the willingness of the firm to incorporate the preferred contract design attributes. Institutional intervention in the input market could induce agri-business firms to offer attractive contracts for smallholders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Returns to Scope? Smallholders Commercialisation through Multipurpose Cooperatives in Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES
AB  - This paper addresses the extent to which the scope of smallholder cooperatives activities may affect their performance in marketing their members surplus output. Previous papers have highlighted such effects and explained it by the extra burden that diversified activities impose on the often limited management capacities of these organisations. We propose an alternative explanation, linking the scope of activities to membership structure: marketing cooperatives engaging in a vast array of unrelated activities may lose their marketing-oriented members for those more interested in the new activities proposed. The models predictions are supported by recently collected data on 172 smallholder grain marketing cooperatives in Ethiopia. Implications for the support of farmer organisations are derived and discussed in conclusion.

TI  - Is Land Fragmentation Facilitating or Obstructing Adoption of Climate Adaptation Measures in Ethiopia?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Land fragmentation is high and increasing in the Gamo Highlands of southwest Ethiopia. We postulate that this substantial land fragmentation is obstructing the adoption of sustainable land management practices as climate adaptation measures. To explore this, a mixed method study was conducted with emphasis on a multivariate probit model. The results indicate that farmers adapt to climate change and variability they perceive. According to the probit model, there is no clear answer to the question whether land fragmentation facilitates or obstructs adoption of sustainable land management practices. Yet, a qualitative analysis found that farmers perceive land fragmentation as an obstacle to land improvement as adaptation strategy. Moreover, farmers invest more in land improvement on plots close to their homestead than in remote plots. However, the higher land fragmentation also promoted crop diversification, manure application and terracing. Although exogenous to farmers, we therefore suggest that land fragmentation can be deployed in climate change adaptation planning. This can be done through voluntary assembling of small neighboring plots in clusters of different microclimates to encourage investment in remote fields and to collectively optimize the benefits of fragmentation to adaptation.

AB  - Agroecology is gaining ground within the debate on how to address systemic social and environmental problems in agriculture. However, it remains marginalized in agricultural research and development plans around the world. This paper analyzes agroecology as a socio-technical niche in Uganda, where its emergence in part can be seen as an unintended consequence of neoliberalist development. The case studied is a civil society network that links farmer groups and non-governmental organizations across different levels. Through the analytical lens of regime dimensions, we find that agroecology is practiced as a smallholder-centric approach that champions collective action, locally appropriate technologies, participatory methods in research and extension, and calls for more active state guidance of agricultural change along specific principles. However, two major concerns are raised; the niche converges with the dominant discourse around commercialization, and policy advocacy is hampered by the apolitical history of NGOs and an increasingly tense political climate. These two areas are critical for agroecology to contribute to just sustainability transitions, and civil society organizations with strong links to smallholder farmers need to be included in the growing scholarly debate both to inform it and to receive guidance from it. Transition frameworks can help facilitate the development of viable institutional designs and explicitly transformative strategies, but we also point towards the need for engagement with theories on civil society collective action and political mobilization.

TI  - Household Vulnerability to Climate Change and Identification of Target Beneficiaries to Implement Household-Specific Adaptation Strategies: A Quantitative Assessment
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study investigated the climate change vulnerability of 6,214 households in the drought-prone districts of Telangana state in India. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis were used to group farm households based on their level of vulnerability to climate change and to suggest a portfolio of adaptation strategies. The PCA revealed the presence of five components from 14 key variables: (1) access to irrigation; (2) credit access, landholding, and income from agriculture; (3) household size and income sources; (4) access to information and climate-smart adaptation practices; and (5) social capital. The first five components (eigenvalue = 1) collectively accounted for 60.42 percent of the total variance. Three clusters emerged after the component scores were analyzed using K-means clustering: extremely vulnerable, moderately vulnerable, and resilient households. The results of the cluster analysis revealed that 79 percent of the households were extremely vulnerable, 11.20 percent were moderately vulnerable, and 9.65 percent were resilient. Moreover, 96 percent of marginal farmers and 94 percent of smallholder farmers were extremely vulnerable, while 19 percent of large farmers and 16 percent of medium farmers were moderately vulnerable. Interestingly, nearly 26 percent in the extremely vulnerable category and 19 percent in the moderately vulnerable category were large farmers, which contradicts previous assumptions. The findings of this study can guide development practitioners, policymakers, and donors in designing evidence-based programs focusing on households vulnerable to climate change.

TI  - The value of guanxi for small vegetable farmers in China
T2  - BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose - Following a guanxi value - buyer-seller relationship quality - marketing behaviour scheme, this paper aims to explore how traditional guanxi supports small vegetable farmers in modem markets in China.
   Design/methodology/approach - Fieldwork was performed in Jiangsu Province, PR China. A stratified random sample of 167 vegetable farmers provided data for empirical testing with partial least squares analysis.
   Findings - The findings suggested that the value of guanxi networks is an antecedent to buyer-seller relationship quality and marketing behaviour in China. Guanxi networks improve the quality of buyer-seller relationships in terms of interpersonal trust and satisfaction. Buyer-seller relationships influence smallholders' transaction relationships, their participation in modem markets and choice for formal contracts. Guanxi networks not only support Chinese small-scale vegetable farmers to get access to modem high-value markets (e.g. supermarkets and international markets), but also encourage informal transactions in the vegetable business.
   Practical implications - Guanxi networks play a critical role in the modem marketing environment in China. Marketing strategies based on personal relationships should be further enhanced in order to increase participation of smallholders in modem markets.
   Originality/value - Quantitative evaluation of the effects of the Chinese cultural embedded concept of guanxi in the Chinese agrifood sector fills in an important research gap.

TI  - Determinants of Producers Participation in Agricultural Cooperatives: Evidence from Northern China
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES AND POLICY
AB  - Agricultural producer cooperatives are of great significance to the development of agricultural productivity and can provide improved economic welfare benefits to farmers. However, such organizations have not been well-developed in China. While Chinas new Cooperatives Law of 2007 has generated interest among scholars, very few empirical analyses have focused on the role of cooperatives in Chinas agricultural sector. The main objective of this study is to investigate the determinants of farmers perception and their decision to participate in cooperatives, using a unique dataset from recently collected survey data of farming households in Chinas Jilin Province. The empirical results from probit and logit regression models suggest that educational attainment, risk comfort level, farm expansion, operational costs, geographic location and crop types are significant factors that influence producers perception of cooperatives, as well as their participation behavior.

TI  - Salt-tolerant rice variety adoption in the Mekong River Delta: Farmer adaptation to sea-level rise
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Rice production in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam (MRD) is endangered by sea-level rise and an associated increase in the incidence of salinity intrusion. This paper examines the diffusion of salt tolerant rice varieties in the MRD that were promoted through Consortium for Unfavorable Rice Environments (CURE) activities. Factors associated with adoption of CURE-related varieties are estimated using a random utilty model and a dataset of 800 farm households with rice fields in salinity prone areas of the MRD. Results suggest that there has been widespread adoption of CURE-related varieties in salinity-prone areas. Further, multivariate analysis reveals that environment and location characteristics, rather than household characteristics, are the most important determinants of adoption. In particular, CURE-related varieties are more likely to be adopted in high-salinity-risk areas that are not protected by salinity barrier gates. Neighbhors' adoption decisions also strongly influence household decisions to adopt CURE-related varieties. The contracting of mechanization, particularly for land preparation and harvest, requires the coordination of village households in timing of planting, harvest and varietal duration. This coordination appears to extend to choice of CURE-related varieties. Finally, CURE-related varieties and other varieties generate similar net revenues in a year with low salinity exposure, suggesting that CURE-related varieties are a low-cost insurance policy against salinity inundation in high risk areas. Combined, these results highlight the need to address complex factors beyond current economic profits, like environment, community choices, and risk mitigation, when designing technologies and policies that support farmer adaptation to climatic change.

TI  - Time Preferences and green agricultural technology adoption: Field evidence from rice farmers in China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Green agricultural technology has the potential to not only alleviate the degradation of soil fertility, but also to improve the agricultural productivity of smallholders. In this paper, taking straw incorporation as an example, experiments were conducted in Chinese villages to directly measure the time preferences of farmers, and an attempt was made to evaluate the contribution of time preferences to farmers' technology adoption behavior. Furthermore, this research aims to assess the moderating role of production scale between the farmer's time preferences and technology adoption. This study is a continuation of previous studies on factors influencing green agricultural technology adoption. The results show that time preferences significantly reduce technology adoption; in particular, farmers who are more present-biased have a lower proportion of technology adoption. This is because farmers with lower discount rates are more sensitive to future income. Further analysis indicates that compared with small-scale farmers, large-scale farmers are more likely to adopt green technology. It is posited that this occurs because large-scale farmers will gain more benefits by adopting green agricultural technology, and thus, they will be more sensitive to high profits in the future. Moreover, the increase of production scale can reduce the inhibitory effect of time preferences on farmers' technology adoption, which means that scale economies play a moderating role between the farmer's time preferences and their technology adoption. Overall, this research provides a micro foundation and policy recommendations for green agricultural technology promotion and sheds light upon how the government can formulate relevant policies to promote green agricultural development.

TI  - Can fruit and vegetable aggregation systems better balance improved producer livelihoods with more equitable distribution?
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The need for food systems to generate sustainable and equitable benefits for all is a global imperative. However, whilst ample evidence exists linking smallholder farmer coordination and aggregation (i.e. the collective transport and marketing of produce on behalf of multiple farmers) to improved market participation and farmer incomes, the extent to which interventions that aim to improve farmer market engagement may co-develop equitable consumer benefits remains uncertain. This challenge is pertinent to the horticultural systems of South Asia, where the increasing purchasing power of urban consumers, lengthening urban catchments, underdeveloped rural infrastructures and inadequate local demands combine to undermine the delivery of fresh fruits and vegetables to smaller, often rural or semi-rural markets serving nutritionally insecure populations. To this end, we investigate the potential for aggregation to be developed to increase fruit and vegetable delivery to these neglected smaller markets, whilst simultaneously improving farmer returns. Using an innovative system dynamics modelling approach based on an aggregation scheme in Bihar, India, we identify potential trade-offs between outcomes relating to farmers and consumers in smaller local markets. We find that changes to aggregation alone (i.e. scaling-up participation; subsidising small market transportation; mandating quotas for smaller markets) are unable to achieve significant improvements in smaller market delivery without risking reduced farmer participation in aggregation. Contrastingly, combining aggregation with the introduction of market-based cold storage and measures that boost demand improves fruit and vegetable availability significantly in smaller markets, whilst avoiding farmer-facing trade-offs. Critically, our study emphasises the benefits that may be attained from combining multiple nutrition-sensitive market interventions, and stresses the need for policies that narrow the fruit and vegetable cold storage deficits that exist away from more lucrative markets in developing countries. The future pathways and policy options discovered work towards making win-win futures for farmers and disadvantaged consumers a reality. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Sero-prevalence and risk factors of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (type 1) in Meru County, Kenya
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the antibody sero-prevalence of Bovine Herpesvirus-1 which cause Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) and to identify risk factors associated with BHV-1 antibody seropositivity among smallholder dairy farms in Meru County, Kenya.
   A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Naari area of Meru County, Kenya between September-October 2016 and March-April 2017. The 149 farmers were randomly selected from members of the Naari Dairy Farmers Cooperative Society who were actively delivering milk to the society at the time of the study. Serum samples were obtained from 403 female dairy cattle. Farm level management and animal factors were collected through direct interviews with the owner or someone who was knowledgeable about the animals. All serum samples were processed with an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gB ELISA) to determine the presence of antibodies to BHV-1.
   The overall farm-level and animal-level sero-prevalences of BHV-1 antibodies were 30.9 % (95 % CI: 23.6%-39.0%) and 17.4 % (95 % CI: 13.8%-21.4%), respectively. In the final multivariable analysis, the factors significantly associated with BHV-1 antibodies included; age of the dairy cattle (OR=1.200, p=0.001), age of the principal female farmers (OR=0.182, p=0.001) and rearing goats in the farm (OR=26.77, p=0.000). There was a significant interaction between rearing goats on the farm and age of the dairy cattle (p < 0.010); younger cattle seemed to have been exposed to BHV or a cross-reacting caprine herpesvirus when goats were on the farm.
   The results showed that BHV-1 was circulating among the cattle population in the Naari area of Meru County. Given that there is not BHV-1 vaccination use in this study population, training on the importance of biosecurity and vaccination for BHV-1 are recommended to reduce the transmission and impacts of BHV-1.

TI  - Cooperative membership, service provision, and the adoption of green control techniques: Evidence from China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - The excessive use of chemical pesticides threatens human health and food safety. The wide application of green control techniques (GCTs) is helping improve the quality and safety of agricultural products. This work examined whether agricultural cooperatives can be used as an institutional arrangement to promote the adoption of GCTs by farmers, using cross-sectional data from a survey of farmers in Shandong Province, China. An endogenous switching probit model that accounted for selection bias was employed in the analysis. The empirical results revealed that cooperative membership significantly improved the probability of farmers adopting GCTs. Access to production services, technical training, and credit services provided by cooperatives significantly increased the probability of adopting GCTs. However, marketing services had no statistically significant impact on the GCT adoption probability. These findings highlight the positive role of contemporary agricultural cooperatives in promoting green production. The government should improve the cooperative service system, strengthen the supervision of cooperative production and operation, and support more farmers to join agricultural cooperatives that practice and enforce cleaner production methods.

TI  - The Socio-economic Effect of the Reform of the Collective Forest Rights System in Southern China: A Case of Tonggu County, Jiangxi Province
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - This paper analyzes the impacts made by reform of the collective forest rights system (RCFRS) on household livelihoods in southern China from 2005 to 2012. A case study was conducted of households mainly in Tonggu County, Jiangxi. The main focus was to obtain basic data about the change in households livelihoods from 2005 to 2012. Following the sustainable livelihood framework, the research subjects were divided into two groups based on income level to identify and confirm the livelihood impacts and changes brought about by the RCFRS. It was found that the RCFRS policy did indeed influence the capital assets, the strategies and the overall quality of life of both low-income and high-income households. Changes in access to capital assets remain unbalanced, especially considering the rapid pace of financial capital changes. The primary means of earning a living in the pilot program areas is still agriculture, while for those households, the best way to obtain capital is by working away from their home town. While 76 % of households are satisfied with their current living situation and are willing to participate in the program continuously, only 59 % of the households from the low-income group said they would continue participating in the program. Therefore, this research suggests that the government should further adjust its compensation policy and improve the social security mechanisms, which would in turn further consolidate the achievements of the RCFRS.

TI  - The Effect of Technical Training Provided by Agricultural Cooperatives on Farmers' Adoption of Organic Fertilizers in China: Based on the Mediation Role of Ability and Perception
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Organic fertilizers can be crucial in promoting sustainable agricultural development, but they are not used in a wide-ranging way among smallholder farmers in many developing countries. In China, cooperatives are considered essential subjects of agricultural technical training, but it is more common to join cooperatives without participating in their technical training. Thus, joining cooperatives or not cannot simply be used to assess the role of cooperatives in influencing the farmers' production behavior. Based on survey data of 1160 citrus farmers in Sichuan Province, China, this study estimated the effect of the technical training provided by agricultural cooperatives on farmers' adoption of organic fertilizers, taking into account the farmers' ability and perception as the mediation variables. The findings showed that participating in the technical training provided by agricultural cooperatives could significantly enhance the likelihood that farmers will adopt organic fertilizers. The impact was 81.6% in influencing the farmer's abilities and 7.64% in their perceptions of organic fertilizers. Furthermore, other variables, such as farm sizes, land transfers, and education levels, also make a difference in the effectiveness of the agricultural cooperatives' technical training. This study provides support for developing pertinent policies to promote the complete adoption of agricultural cooperatives' technical training functions and the widespread use of organic fertilizers.

TI  - Sharecropping efficiency in Ethiopia: Threats of eviction and kinship
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
CP  - 26th Meeting of the International-Association-of-Agricultural-Economists (IAAE)
AB  - We tested a theoretical model with the Marshallian inefficiency (H I) and threat of eviction (H2) hypotheses having opposite effects on land productivity on sharecropped plots. The model also assumes that kinship contracts may eliminate or reduce the Marshallian inefficiency (143) and threat of eviction (H4) effects on land productivity. Our empirical findings were consistent with H2 and H4 being true. We found higher land productivity on sharecropped plots than on share tenants' own plots and higher land productivity on sharecropped plots of nonkin than of kin tenants. The nature of the data allowed controlling for unobservable household characteristics through household fixed effects and for observable plot characteristics. Analyses with and without plot characteristics revealed that these findings were stronger with plot characteristics than without them. Based on the plausible assumption that observable plot characteristics are positively correlated with unobservable plot characteristics this strengthens our conclusion. The results are also supported by first-order stochastic dominance analysis. Sharecropped plots' output value distribution unambiguously dominated the output value distribution from share tenants' own plots. Nonkin sharecropped plots' output value distribution also first-order stochastically dominated the output value distribution from kin sharecrop plots.

TI  - The cost effectiveness of payments for ecosystem services-Smallholders and agroforestry in Africa
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Certain smallholder farmers in parts of sub-Saharan Africa engage in conservation agriculture and participate in agroforestry ecosystem services schemes that generate additional on-farm revenues through payment for ecosystem services (PES). However, smallholder farmers that are inadequately compensated for the foregone income from agricultural production due to marginal ecosystem services provision have no incentive to participate. On the other hand, over-compensating participating farmers will also lead to PES schemes inefficiencies. Therefore, stakeholders are confronted with the challenge of evaluating farm-level interactions between agricultural production and ecosystem services' provision when making strategic decisions on the efficient level of compensation. We propose in this contribution to assess the efficiency of PES schemes by measuring the marginal cost of ecosystem services based on farm level bio-economic interactions. The quantitative assessment is based on a theoretical classification of the relationship between marketed agricultural output and ecosystem services into complementary, supplementary or competitive. We use a flexible transformation function and cross-sectional data on 120 surveyed smallholder farmers with agroforestry certification in rural Mount Kenya. The results suggest that the joint production (of agricultural output and ecosystem services) for a substantial number of smallholder farms in Kenya may not show a complementary relationship. The biophysical linkage between marketed outputs and ecosystem services strongly influences the marginal cost of ecosystem services. PES schemes could become more efficient if they would target smallholder farms based on the aforementioned classifications by offering a range of contracts to encourage competitive bidding.

TI  - The essential role of farm capital in the sustainability of smallholder farms in West Java (Indonesia)
T2  - CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB  - Smallholder farms represent the largest population of dairy cattle farms in Indonesia. Dairy activities can play an important role to secure the livelihood of smallholder farms. However, small farms face several constraints and challenges to be sustainable in the future. To assess the sustainability of smallholder dairy farms and to understand in what conditions farms are more sustainable, we conducted a study in two districts of the West Java Province. Our method was based on participatory meetings that allowed us to identify "critical features" of the local farming systems, and associated indicators. From discussions with local stakeholders, we proposed 6 "strategic indicators" of sustainability. Five of those indicators were related to the social and economic dimensions of sustainability, which appeared to be crucial in the local context. To assess the sustainability of farms based on those 6 indicators, we collected secondary data from the local cooperative, and carried out a formal field survey to 355 farmers from May to August 2015. Results showed that the most sustainable farms were those who had highest capital and diversified activity. Farms which had low capital but had additional activity were more sustainable than specialized ones. Whereas the level of farm income appears to be linked directly to farm capital, pluriactivity contributes to reduce risks related to dairy business and to gain benefit from synergies between activities. In the future, policies and projects to enhance farm capital and farmers' pluriactivity will be needed to support the sustainability of smallholder farms.

TI  - Estimating effects of cooperative membership on farmers' safe production behaviors: Evidence from pig sector in China
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - This research studies the determinants of pig farmers' participation in farmers' cooperatives and the effects of farmers' cooperatives on pig farmers' behaviors in adopting safe production practices using data from a household survey of 540 cooperative farmers and 270 non-cooperative farmers from four main pig production provinces in China. The propensity score matching (PSM) method was adopted to deal with possible self-selection bias associated with farmers' participation in farmers' cooperatives due to observables, which is further supplemented by a sensitivity analysis to assess the degree to which the PSM results are robust to the presence of unobservables. The PSM results show that the cooperative membership has significant and positive influence on farmers' propensity to adopt safe production practices and the effects are heterogeneous across a number of key cooperative, farm and household attributes. Specifically, the membership effects tend to be bigger for cooperatives led by Investor-owned firms (IOFs) and farms of small production scale. And the effects tend to be greater for households (1) of medium and high level of education, (2) of less than 10 years of pig production experience, (3) of no off-farm job experience, and (4) that are specialized in pig production. The sensitivity analysis further increases our confidence in the results for the feed use and the breed use, however, the results for vaccination, drug use and waste disposable are more sensitive to the influence of unobservables, therefore should be interpreted with caution.

TI  - No change for thirty years: The renewed question of women's land rights in rural China
T2  - DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
AB  - Since the mid-1990s, a new land-use rights regime has gradually come into effect in China. It follows upon a series of earlier changes - land reform, collectivization and the first wave of contracting land to households - that paid attention to women's role in publicly recognized work and provided access to land. The new regime, which has gradually come into effect as previous (usually fifteen-year) terms expired, authorizes an adjustment in land allocation which is then normally frozen for thirty years. An apparently inadvertent effect of this policy is not only the exclusion of young people from direct access to land for up to thirty years from birth, but the de facto separation of the majority of women who marry or remarry patrilocally from allocated land. 'No change for thirty years' (sanshi nian hu bian) has thus become the distinctive feature for women of China's current land-use regime. The state has renounced its potential to reallocate land periodically and there is no indication that market mechanisms are filling, or are capable of filling, the void thereby created. This article examines local conceptions, responses and practices regarding land-use rights and their transfer within this new framework, using field evidence from three upland agricultural communities in Chongqing and Sichuan (studied in 2003, 2004 and 2005), where land allocations were fixed in 1995, 1999 and 2001 respectively. The ethnographic findings are further explored in relation to contemporary research on gender and land rights.

TI  - The impact of different benefit packages of Medical Financial Assistance Scheme on health service utilization of poor population in Rural China
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Since 2003 and 2005, National Pilot Medical Financial Assistance Scheme (MFA) has been implemented in rural and urban areas of China to improve the poorest families' accessibility to health services. Local governments of the pilot areas formulated various benefit packages. Comparative evaluation research on the effect of different benefit packages is urgently needed to provide evidence for improving policy-making of MFA. This study was based on a MFA pilot project, which was one component of Health VIII Project conducted in rural China. This article aimed to compare difference in health services utilization of poor families between two benefit package project areas: H8 towns (package covering inpatient service, some designated preventive and curative health services but without out-patient service reimbursement in Health VIII Project,) and H8SP towns (package extending coverage of target population, covering out-patient services and reducing co-payment rate in Health VIII Supportive Project), and to find out major influencing factors on their services utilization.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2004, which used stratified cluster sampling method to select poor families who have been enrolled in MFA scheme in rural areas of ChongQing. All family members of the enrolled households were interviewed. 748 and 1129 respondents from two kinds of project towns participated in the survey. Among them, 625 and 869 respondents were included (age >= 15) in the analysis of this study. Two-level linear multilevel model and binomial regressions with a log link were used to assess influencing factors on different response variables measuring service utilization.
   Results: In general, there was no statistical significance in physician visits and hospitalizations among all the respondents between the two kinds of benefit package towns. After adjusting for major confounding factors, poor families in H8SP towns had much higher frequency of MFA use (beta = 1.17) and less use of hospitalization service (OR = 0.7 (H8SP/H8), 95% CI (0.5, 1.0)) among all the respondents. While calculating use of hospital services among those who needed, there was significant difference (p = 0.032) in percentage of hospitalization use between H8SP towns (46%) and H8 towns (33%). Meanwhile, the non-use but ought-to-use hospitalization ratio of H8SP (54%) was lower than that of H8 (67%) towns. This indicated that hospitalization utilizations had improved in H8SP towns among those who needed. Awareness of MFA detailed benefit package and presence of physician diagnosed chronic disease had significant association with frequency of MFA use and hospitalizations. There was no significant difference in rate of borrowing money for illness treatment between the two project areas. Large amount of medical debt had strong association with hospitalization utilization.
   Conclusions: The new extended benefit package implemented in pilot towns significantly increased the poor families' accessibility to MFA package in H8SP than that of H8 towns, which reduced poor families' demand of hospitalization services for their chronic diseases, and improved the poor population's utilization of out-patient services to some degree. It can encourage poor people to use more outpatient services thus reduce their hospitalization need. Presence of chronic disease and hospitalization had strong association with the presence of large amount of medical debt, which indicated that: although establishment of MFA had facilitated accessibility of poor families to this new system, and improved service utilization of poor families to some degree, but its role in reducing poor families' medical debt resulted from chronic disease and hospitalization was still very limited. Besides, the following requirements of MFA: co-payment for in-patient services, ceiling and deductibles for reimbursement, limitations on eligibility for diseases reimbursement, also served as most important obstacles for poor families' access to health care.
   Therefore, there is great need to improve MFA benefit package design in the future, including extending to cover outpatient services, raising ceiling for reimbursement, removing deductibles of MFA, reducing co-payment rate, and integrating MFA with New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme more closely so as to provide more protection to the poor families.

TI  - A survey-based exploration of land-system dynamics in an agricultural region of Northeast China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Understanding the complexity of agricultural systems requires insight into the human-environment interactions. In this paper we used survey data to analyze land system change and its relation to farmer's attitudes in a typical agricultural region of Northeast China, focusing on land tenure, crop choice and intensification. Our survey shows that land transfer was fairly common across the study area: average farmland acreage per household almost doubled from 1.3 ha by early 1980s to 2.6 ha by early 2010s, especially due to urban migration of farmers. The survey indicates an increase in land transfers over time with a sharp decrease of the average period of land transfer contracts. Crop choice displays a trend of decreasing diversity as several cereal crops are no longer grown in the study region and the majority of bean cultivation has been replaced by maize and tobacco. Land transfers can explain part of these changes, butnot necessarily the full change to a dominance of a smaller number of crops at the region level. Irrigation intensity is related to the locations of rivers, while agricultural inputs, along with land transfer and crop allocation, show a spatial pattern which is related to road accessibility. Survey results show that two family characteristics (education level and the initially allocated land rights) and two socioeconomic factors (infrastructure and crop prices) are important in making land transfer decisions, while external factors such as market, policy, local cropping system, and agricultural disasters have substantially influenced crop choice decisions. The survey approach is very valuable to analyze land system changes from a stakeholder's perspective, especially in the absence of statistical data atfarm level. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Effects of certified-organic production on supplier failures and potential income effects of supplier failures on producers: Evidence from vegetable and macadamia producers in Kenya
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - Organic agriculture uses contracts and networks to overcome its asset-specificity problems and to ensure compliance with its standards and norms, including environmental conservation. This study analyzed the effects of certified-organic production on supplier failures and the potential income effects of these failures on vegetable and macadamia producers in Kenya. Using survey data and propensity score matching, the study found that organic macadamia production reduces delivery failures because its asset specificity necessitates a dedicated transport system. It also found that organic vegetable production reduces quality failures because organic consumers are often less concerned about the physical quality of organic produce. However, despite these advantages, cases of supplier failures are still rampant among both organic and nonorganic producers of macadamia and vegetables. The potential income effects of these supplier failures, especially quantity and delivery failures in macadamia, raise concerns. These problems necessitate policy interventions, especially with respect to establishing and strengthening producer organizations, which are often very instrumental in overcoming quality, quantity, and delivery failures.

TI  - Post-Soviet Agricultural Restructuring: A Success Story After All?
T2  - COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - Challenging the initial expectation that all post-Soviet economies will evolve from collective toward fully individualized farming, I argue that they separated into two different reform paths. In the European successor countries and Kazakhstan, corporate and family farms coexist, labor exited agriculture, and capital inflow boosted labor productivity (a "Westernization"). In the Transcaucasian and the other Central Asian countries, complete farm individualization did not increase labor productivity much, in turn keeping rural incomes depressed (a "Southernization" akin to the Global South). Future policies should promote income alternatives to agriculture and improve the flexibility and transparency of farm consolidation processes.

TI  - Climate variability, perceptions and political ecology: Factors influencing changes in pesticide use over 30 years by Zimbabwean smallholder cotton producers
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Pesticides represent a potential public health hazard of note in farming communities. Accumulating evidence indicates that some pesticides used in agriculture act as hormone disrupters, with the potential to result in chronic health effects. Despite such a growing evidence base, pesticides remain the preferred method of pest control in agriculture worldwide. In many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, usage is on the increase. This qualitative study assessed changes in the usage of pesticides by Zimbabwean smallholder cotton farmers in the past 30 years. Farmers reported an increase in the usage of pesticides, specifically insecticides, since the early 1980s. An increase in pest populations was also reported. The findings suggested a bi-directional causal relationship between the increase in pest population and the increase in pesticide use. Factors which emerged to have collectively impacted on the changes include climate variability, limited agency on the part of farmers, power dynamics involving the government and private cotton companies and farmers' perceptions and practices. An Integrated Pest Management Policy for Zimbabwe is recommended to facilitate integration of chemical controls with a broad range of other pest control tactics. Continuous farmer education and awareness raising is further recommended, since farmers' perceptions can influence their practices.

TI  - Comparative Economic Assessment of Conventional and Organic Hazelnut Farming in Turkey: Results of Questionnaires from Three Years
T2  - BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare organic hazelnut fanning with conventional production based on data drawn from questionnaires. The Black Sea region of Turkey is the highest producer of hazelnuts in the world, where production is carried out by small family farms. Hazelnut production is the single most important economic activity (monoculture) and income resource of the households in the region. In 2006, 620 farmers produced 7150 of organic hazelnuts oil 4699 ha of land. Sample farms were selected using the stratified sampling method. Financial and physical data were collected front the farmers using a questionnaire and through personal interviews. The results of a three-year study indicate that yield of organic farms was 12.4% higher in the Ordu-Samsun region (Eastern Black Sea Region) and 1.2% lower in the Duzce region (Western Black Sea Region) than on conventional farms; and the price received by organic farmers was 8.1% and 1.5% higher, respectively, than that received by conventional producers. The gross margin per hectare of plantation area in organic fanning was 12.0% and the net margin was 117.7% higher than that of conventional farms in the Ordu-Samsun region, whereas they were 0.3% and 2.2% higher than that of conventional farming in the Dame region. The results indicated that organic hazelnut farming has made a positive contribution to the economies of farms in general. The key requirements for the further development of organic fanning would be centred on farm diversification, increased premium prices and governmental support, as well as improving the practices of organic cultivation and orchard management. On the other hand, enhancement of organic fanning in the region in the short term will be limited by low domestic and foreign demand, low price premiums, a lack of state support and the technical and financial capacities of the companies contracted with the producers.

TI  - Food coping strategies among migrant labourers on cocoa farms in southern Ghana
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - This paper examines coping strategies adopted by migrant labourers on cocoa farms in Southern Ghana in the face of food shortfalls. Using primary data from 400 labourers on cocoa farms, this paper employs coping strategy index, negative binomial, Tobit and multivariate probit regression models to investigate migrants' food coping mechanisms, and their key determinants. Generally, migrants on cocoa farms were constrained with low quality food and limited food availability during certain periods of the year. Migrant labourers suffering from food shortfalls adopted food-compromising and income-maximizing coping strategies. The main strategies include consumption of less preferred foods and immature crops, borrowing of food and money, reduction in portion sizes during mealtimes, and reduction in the number of meals eaten per day. Farm labourers with higher education, income, secondary occupation, own farms, social capital, secured contract, work for multiple farmers, and asset ownership tended to cope better during periods of food shortfalls. The effects of these factors on the adoption of specific food coping strategies differed markedly. To improve household resilience in the face of food shortfalls, migrant labourers on cocoa farms should engage in secondary occupations, do their own farms, build social capital by joining faith-based organizations and tribal associations, as well as engage in long term contract arrangements with their principals.

TI  - Farm, household, and farmer characteristics associated with changes in management practices and technology adoption among dairy smallholders
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - This study explored whether technology adoption and changes in management practices were associated with farm structure, household, and farmer characteristics and to identify processes that may foster productivity and sustainability of small-scale dairy farming in the central highlands of Mexico. Factor analysis of survey data from 44 smallholders identified three factors-related to farm size, farmer's engagement, and household structure-that explained 70 % of cumulative variance. The subsequent hierarchical cluster analysis yielded three clusters. Cluster 1 included the most senior farmers with fewest years of education but greatest years of experience. Cluster 2 included farmers who reported access to extension, cooperative services, and more management changes. Cluster 2 obtained 25 and 35 % more milk than farmers in clusters 1 and 3, respectively. Cluster 3 included the youngest farmers, with most years of education and greatest availability of family labor. Access to a network and membership in a community of peers appeared as important contributors to success. Smallholders gravitated towards easy to implement technologies that have immediate benefits. Nonusers of high investment technologies found them unaffordable because of cost, insufficient farm size, and lack of knowledge or reliable electricity. Multivariate analysis may be a useful tool in planning extension activities and organizing channels of communication to effectively target farmers with varying needs, constraints, and motivations for change and in identifying farmers who may exemplify models of change for others who manage farms that are structurally similar but performing at a lower level.

TI  - Local community's preferences for accepting a forestry partnership contract to grow pulpwood in Indonesia: A choice experiment study
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Forestry partnership schemes have been deployed to integrate industrial plantations' and local communities' interests in forest resource management. However, the unsatisfactory impacts of the scheme lead to both parties reassessing the value of the partnership schemes. This article explores local communities' willingness to remain in or opt-out of the partnership schemes designed to grow pulpwood in Indonesia, and investigates their preferences for accepting the modified contract attributes. The contract attributes include contract length, labor participation, insurance, training, road improvement and income. A choice experiment approach was used to estimate preferences of 287 smallholders, of which half were participating with the timber industry under Company-Community Partnership schemes. The results show that a bundle of the contract attributes that could increase local communities' utility are provision of road improvement, higher expected income, and higher timber production insurance. Greater incentives are required to compensate smallholders' loss of utility due to longer contract length and monitoring planted areas. The preferences vary significantly depending on smallholders' participation status in the scheme but not land tenure status. The continuity of the partnership schemes is challenged by a significant number of respondents always rejecting the contract option. The implication of the findings is that designing a bundle of contract attributes focusing on a promotive social safeguard approach likely keeps the participating smallholders in the schemes.

TI  - Risk sharing, benefit distribution and cooperation longevity: sustainable development of dairy farmer cooperatives in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The sustainable development of cooperatives is essential to agricultural sustainability and is determined mainly by cooperation longevity. The risk sharing and benefit distribution mechanisms are important governance arrangements that affect cooperation longevity in member-heterogeneous cooperatives. However, the relationship between cooperatives' risk sharing and benefit distribution arrangements and cooperation longevity is not well understood. To address this research gap, we provide a conceptual framework to illustrate the relationship between risk sharing, benefit distribution, contract form and cooperation longevity. By conducting 23 interviews with three dairy cooperatives in China using a multiple-case-study method, we find that cooperation longevity is influenced by the alignment of the combination of risk sharing and benefit distribution for cooperatives and their members. Following the principles of risk-benefit equivalence and strategy-risk preference matching, we discuss four scenarios of match or mismatch of combinations of risk sharing and benefit distribution. We suggest that the government needs to strengthen risk mitigation capabilities for cooperatives and members, and to help them to build an effective risk sharing and benefit distribution arrangement to achieve sustainable development.

TI  - Smallholder willingness to pay and preferences in the way irrigation water should be managed: a choice experiment application in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - WATER SA
AB  - Efficient and sustainable utilization of irrigation water is the key to realizing the objective of enhancing agricultural productivity and commercializing smallholder irrigation farming. Valuing and recognizing the scarcity of irrigation water is essential for its sustainable use. Using cross-sectional data from 328 smallholders in and around Makhathini and Ndumo-B irrigation schemes in KwaZulu-Natal Province, the study aimed to assess smallholder farmers' preferences for the way irrigation water resources should be managed and their willingness to pay for irrigation water. This was done employing a choice experiment method. The results suggest the need for irrigation water pricing to reflect irrigation intensity. They also show that improving agricultural production and productivity, with market access can enhance farmers' willingness and ability to pay for irrigation water. The need to consider multiple uses of irrigation water for sustainable utilization of water resources is evident, while supporting women smallholders will have a positive impact on their willingness to pay for irrigation water. The paper recommends a shift towards on-farm volumetric water pricing in the irrigation schemes. The schemes should also have clearly defined boundaries and enforceable rules on collective use of water. The design of irrigation infrastructure should integrate other uses of irrigation water such as domestic and livestock purposes. Consequently, there is a need for further research to ensure that irrigation water prices reflect the marginal value of irrigation water use. Policies should address factors that inherently result in gender differences in terms of access to productive resources which negatively affect sustainable water utilization.

TI  - Smallholder Sugarcane Farmers' Participation and Profitability of Factory Contracted Services in Malaya Sub-County, Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION
AB  - This study evaluated the effect of participation in factory contracted services on the profitability of smallholder sugarcane farmers in Malaya Sub-county in Western Kenya. Primary data were collected using structured questionnaire from a sample of 384 farmers using systematic random sampling and proportionate sampling. Analysis of variance was applied to determine if there was a significant difference between profitability of contracted and non-contracted farmers. The effect of contracted services on profitability among contract farmers was analyzed by multiple linear regression. The results showed that contracted extension, labour and credit services had significant effect on farmers' gross margins. The Kenyan government should formulate policies that enhance provision of contracted extension, labour and credit services. The need for a review of the existing contract engagement terms among sugarcane farmers is also evident in this study.

TI  - Networks of Rural Producer Organizations in Uganda: What Can be Done to Make Them Work Better?
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Rural producer organizations (RPOs) are currently seen as mechanisms of reducing transaction costs and improving market access of smallholder farmers. Yet little is known about the determinants of RPO effectiveness, especially in Sub-Saharan African countries. In this article we assess functioning of Ugandan RPO using a combination of participatory research and survey methods. We recommend areas for development interventions that would enhance the positive impact of RPO on livelihoods of their members. The proposed interventions refer to monetary transactions between RPO and their members, information channels within RPO, access to inputs and finance, member knowledge capacity and motivation of leaders.

TI  - Sustainability of centralized contract farming among tobacco smallholder farmers in Makoni North District, Zimbabwe
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - The study explores centralized contract farming sustainability among tobacco smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe. Despite studies on centralized contract farming to date, little has been theorized with regard to its sustainability. Using mixed-method research, questionnaires, key informant interviews, document review and focus group discussions were employed in gathering data from farmers, Extension Officers and field officers of the contracting firms. Using Pearson Correlation Coefficient and thematic analysis findings revealed that centralized contract tobacco farming is unsustainable. Institutional contract arrangements are manipulative and are unwelcome to farmers. Economically, contracting firms find it viable as they obtain more profit at the expense of smallholder farmers. Although farmers are assured of inputs, extension service and market for the product, the contract terms are characterized by transaction cost, uncertainty and information asymmetry. Moreso, although financial and physical assets ownership have been increased, human, natural and social capital are a challenge. Shocks, stresses and seasonality still characterize the vulnerability context of the farmers as society has been exposed to women and child abuses, food insecurity, and social decay. The study therefore recommends an increased participatory action and learning in crafting and implementing contract terms by farmers, state and non-state actors for sustainability to be realized.

TI  - ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY AND ORGANIZATION OF THE PRODUCTIVE CHAIN OF HONEY IN CAMPECHE, MEXICO
T2  - AGRICULTURA SOCIEDAD Y DESARROLLO
AB  - The global food market, based on strict sanitary and quality standards, imposes new challenges to production and marketing by small-scale producers in developing countries. In this article the economic efficiency of small-scale beekeepers is examined, as well as the relationships between actors and the functioning of the honey chain in Campeche, Mexico. The information was obtained through in-depth interviews with key informants, and community workshops. The results show that the conventional honey chain is efficient, although it favors large cooperatives and private trading companies due to economies of scale. Small-scale producers and their organizations can increase their competitiveness through differentiation of the product and diversification of the activity, but only if they are capable of establishing new agreements with other actors of the chain. In addition, the government can favor the development of these organizations and promote commercial, technological and institutional innovations between actors of the chain.

TI  - Factors Influencing Tea Farmers' Decisions to Utilize Sources of Credit in Nyaruguru District, Rwanda: A Multivariate Probit Regression Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Credit is a major tool and an important factor for tea production and farm outcome. Its demand from different lending sources has been increasing to meet capital investment in the tea sector. Accessed credit is to meet costs of tea production, mainly fertilizers, seedlings, and labor as well. Factors affecting access to credit have been a subject of vast debate in recent studies that credit seekers obtain credits only when they are eligible by complying with the requirements set by lending institutions. However, literature has limited findings on the behavior of small-scale borrowers in selecting a credit source and inducing factors. In particular, borrowing arrangements necessitate the analysis to inform policy makers on needed adjustment in the lending system to improve tea production and sector development. The study aims at disclosing responsible factors to choose a particular credit source by smallholder tea farmers. A survey was conducted with 358 tea growers selected randomly in two cooperatives that operated in Nyaruguru District. A multivariate probit model was used for analytical analysis. Borrowing from formal source (commercial banks) increased if borrower possessed collateral asset (85.5%), interest rate (85.0%) size of tea plantation (24.8%) and household composition (10.5%). Using informal sources increased if a farmer desired a small credit (83.2%), participated in technical training (76.9%), and received joint credit (46.9%), while a farmer was likely to use less informal sources if his/her farm size (39.9%) and household income (29.2%) were small. However, combining sources of credit was used by farmers as a safeguard strategy to acquire the desired loan. A government policy, which aims to increase productive investment, should emphasize integrating agricultural loans in financial system targeting smallholder farmers through their organizations where they can relax credit constraints.

TI  - Participating Farmers' Equity of Hospitalization benefit under the New Rural Cooperative Medical System: Evidence from Shaanxi Province
T2  - HEALTHMED
AB  - Background and aim: In 2002, the Chinese government began to gradually establish a new rural cooperative medical system (NRCMS) aimed at providing integrated subsidy mainly for serious diseases (during hospitalization). To analyze and evaluate the participating farmers' benefit equity of hospitalization under NRCMS, this article used data from the household survey on health services gathered in Shaanxi Province as part of the Fourth National Health Service Survey (NHSS).
   Methods: We adopt a concentration index to measure equity, and a Tobit regression model is employed to analyze the factors influencing the hospitalization subsidy.
   Results: We ranked participating farmers according to their village's per-capita expenditure and then divided them into five quintiles. An analysis of each group's inpatient expense, inpatient xpense paid by NRCMS, and the compensation rate for inpatient revealed no significant differences among the groups. The concentration indices of the number of times inpatient benefited from NRCMS and inpatient expense paid by NRCMS were 0.142 and, 0.094, respectively. All participating farmers were then classified according to their household per-capita expenditure. There were significant differences in per-visit inpatient expense and per-visit inpatient expense paid by NRCMS among the groups, but there was no significant difference in the compensation rate for inpatient. The concentration indices of the number of times inpatient benefited from NRCMS and inpatient expense paid by NRCMS were 0.253 and 0.355, respectively.
   Conclusions: The results showed during the process of implementation of the NRCMS, a benefit inequity existed in the hospitalization of the participating farmers of the underdeveloped western region. Overall, however, the inequity was not very large.

TI  - Traditional Food Crop Marketing in Sub-Saharan Africa: Does Gender Matter?
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - The present study aims to contribute to the scarce literature on traditional food crop marketing by analysing the factors influencing (a) the household's decision to participate in the market and (b) the selling prices obtained by the household. Using an econometric approach, we analyse household data from 270 finger millet producers in western Kenya. A main focus of the study lies on the role of gender and farmer group participation. Results show that group membership increases the probability of market participation and is of particular importance for female farmers, who obtain higher selling prices when participating in a group.

TI  - Towards decentralization and privatization of China's collective forestlands: A study of nine villages in 3 provinces
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - China started forestland tenure reform in the early 1980s. The reforms have been evolving and vary significantly from region to region. Unlike in agriculture, it is too simplistic to use a household responsibility system (HRS) to generalize about the reforms in forestry. Despite variations in time and place, a trend towards privatization started to become apparent when the central government began a pilot experiment called the "new stage of forestland tenure reform" in the early 2000s and went on to implement the reform nationwide. This paper compares various paths towards decentralization and privatization and the adoption of market mechanisms in collective forestry, but Pays special attention to the new reforms by examining and comparing 9 villages in 3 provinces in Southeast China where collective forest ownership is dominant. The impact of the new reform along with, public attitudes, and Current challenges are investigated and discussed.

TI  - Risk preference, interlinked credit and insurance contract and agricultural innovative technology adoption
T2  - JOURNAL OF INNOVATION & KNOWLEDGE
AB  - This paper explores the impact of risk preference as well as interlinked credit and insurance contract on peasants' new technology adoption. The results show that (1) risk preference has a significant impact on peasants' adoption of innovative seeds, and the influence of exact probabilistic risk preference on peasants' adoption of innovative seeds is greater than that of ambiguous probabilistic risk preference. (2) Interlinked credit and insurance contract has a significant positive impact on peasants' adoption of innovative seeds, and interlinked credit and insurance contract plays a moderating role in promoting peasants' adoption of innovative seeds. (3) Peasants' education level, the degree of land fragmentation, the proportion of grain cultivation in the household-cultivated land, whether to provide meteorological disaster warning services, and the distance to financial services also have a significant impact on peasants' adoption of innovative seeds. This interplay between collateral and the nature of credit-insurance interlinkage has direct and important implications for the design of programs to boost the adoption of innovative agricultural technologies simultaneously, and sheds light upon how the government can formulate relevant policies to promote innovative technological development.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Agroforestry rubber networks and farmers groups in Phatthalung area in Southern Thailand: A potential for an innovation platform?
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
AB  - The study took place in southern Thailand, in Phatthalung province, and is part of "Heveadapt," a Franco-Thai research project. The aim of this project was to show how smallholder rubber plantations can adapt and remain sustainable in the face of variable climatic conditions and deep changes in socio-economic context. Among the various types of cropping systems, agroforestry practices were identified as promising. Rubber agroforestry systems (AFS) are economically more productive than rubber monocrop plantations and give more flexibility to smallholders, in particular when rubber prices are low, which has been the case since 2013. However, adoption of AFS during the mature period of the plantations is very low in Thailand. The policy to boost rubber agroforestry practices still needs to be developed with all local stakeholders. The objectives of the study were to identify the possibilities and capacities to use current AFS dynamic networks as a basis to set up a rubber agroforestry innovation platform. The research team studied: i) farmers' collective organizations, groups or networks with rubber AFS partially or entirely and ii) the social dynamic enabling the sharing of knowledge and know-how. An individual producer's grid, with original farmers or strong knowledge with ease of sharing, was also studied. The role of local institutions involved in the promotion of rubber AFS was also analyzed. This allowed us to design an innovation platform and to define activities that suit the socio-economic context of Phatthalung province. The main aims of the platform are to promote cooperation among innovative producers and the transmission between them of knowledge and know-how about rubber AFS. This could an efficient tool that Thai rubber institutions could set up to encourage the adoption of rubber AFS by farmers.

TI  - RISK SOURCES AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AMONG CASSAVA FARMERS IN ABIA STATE, NIGERIA
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study identified sources of risk and risk management strategies among cassava farmers in Abia State, Nigeria. A total of 518 cassava farmers were randomly selected from four local government areas and data were collected using structured interview schedule. Descriptive statistics such as mean, percentages and frequency were used to present data. Likert attitudinal scale was used to evaluate the risk attitude of cassava farmers. Results showed that the mean age and household size of the farmers was 48 years and 7 persons respectively, with 59.9% of the farmers being females. Main sources of risk in cassava production as identified by the cassava farmers were erratic rainfall (77.2%), inadequate credit facilities (70.3%), low price of output (69.1%), cassava pest and disease (59.1%), high cost of inputs (57.5%) and inadequate market for produce (51.7%). The Likert attitudinal scale showed that 69.5% of the farmers were risk averse. Some risk reducing strategies were not employed by the farmers, reason being that they are either not available or difficult to implement. The most popular risk reducing strategy used was enterprise diversification (100.0%). The study recommended that cassava farmers with support from government and private sector should develop comprehensive risk management strategies with maximum benefit when used in combination, also agricultural policy makers should make policies that will encourage cassava farmers to use formal insurance, cooperative marketing and forward contracting more as a means of reducing social and market risks.

TI  - Gender and Agriculture: Inefficiencies, Segregation, and Low Productivity Traps
T2  - WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER
AB  - Women make essential contributions to agriculture in developing countries, where they constitute approximately 43 percent of the agricultural labor force. However, female farmers typically have lower output per unit of land and are much less likely to be active in commercial farming than their male counterparts. These gender differences in land productivity and participation between male and female farmers are due to gender differences in access to inputs, resources, and services. In this paper, we review the evidence on productivity differences and access to resources. We discuss some of the reasons for these differences, such as differences in property rights, education, control over resources (e.g., land), access to inputs and services (e.g., fertilizer, extension, and credit), and social norms. Although women are less active in commercial farming and are largely excluded from contract farming, they often provide the bulk of wage labor in the nontraditional export sector. In general, gender gaps do not appear to fall systematically with growth, and they appear to rise with GDP per capita and with greater access to resources and inputs. Active policies that support womens access and participation, not just greater overall access, are essential if these gaps are to be closed. The gains in terms of greater productivity of land and overall production are likely to be large.

TI  - Stuck in a rut: emerging cocoa cooperatives in Peru and the factors that influence their performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Agri-cooperatives play an important role in helping resource-poor farmers reach high-value markets. In addition to linking smallholders to markets, cooperatives provide their members with various services, such as extension, credit, input subsidies, and social programmes. While the literature contains many examples of success, there has been limited discussion on the often long and turbulent process by which cooperatives develop over time and the viable options for shortcuts. This study examines four emerging cocoa cooperatives in Peru to determine their overall business viability, the key factors that advanced their development, and their capacity to address the needs of their members. Our findings suggest that strategies for supporting cooperative development have largely failed to address major internal weaknesses and the challenges posed in the external environment. The cooperatives have received time-bound, uncoordinated, and often small-scale, interventions, which have focused on infrastructure expansion and technical assistance. Important areas related to business management and governance structures, trust relationships with buyers, and sufficient working capital have largely been ignored. Shortcuts may be achieved through improvements in access to business development and financial services, deeper engagement by private sector to support the development process, and commitment by stakeholders to monitoring and critical reflection for strategy refinement.

TI  - Certified organic agriculture in Mexico: Market connections and certification practices in large and small producers
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Certification within organic agriculture exhibits flexibility with respect to practices used to demonstrate that a product meets published quality standards This case study of Mexican certified-organic agriculture finds two forms. Indigenous smallholders of southern Mexico undertake a low-input, process-oriented organic farming in which certification is based upon extensive document review, group inspections, and assessment of on-farm capacity to produce organic inputs. More recently, northern Mexican large agribusiness producers have implemented certifications based upon laboratory testing and assessment of purchased inputs. To specify these differences, this article examines large and small producers in Mexico's organic agriculture sector based on a diagnostic census of Mexican organic agriculture in 668 production zones and field surveys in 256 production zones in which 28 indicators were analyzed. After comparing the organic cultivation and certification practices of large, agro-industrial, input-oriented private firms versus small, cooperatively organized, indigenous and peasant groups, we analyze the implications of this duality for certification frameworks. We argue (with Raynolds, L, 2004 The globalization of organic agro-food networks. World Development 32(5), 725-743; Gonzalez A.A, and Nigh, R., 2005. Smallholder participation and certification of organic farm products in Mexico. Journal of Rural Studies; DeLind, L., 2000. Transforming organic agriculture into industrial organic products reconsidering national organic standards. Human Organization 59(2), 198-208) that the increasing bureaucratic requirements of international organic certification privilege large farmers and agribusiness-style organic cultivation and present the possibility of a new entrenchment of socio-spatial inequality in Mexico While organic and fair trade agriculture has been touted as an income-generating production strategy for small producers of the Global South, our study suggests that Mexican organic agriculture reproduces existing social inequalities between large and small producers in conventional Mexican agriculture.

TI  - An assessment of collective action for pond management in Zhanghe Irrigation System (ZIS), China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Ponds are common property resources that allow users to obtain water on-demand because of their capacity to store rainwater and other surplus water close to users. Effective management of these ponds is crucial, especially with increasing water scarcity and decreasing water deliveries for agriculture that are taking place in many irrigation systems, including the Zhanghe Irrigation System (ZIS) in China. The purpose of this study was to determine the nature and performance of collective action in pond management, and to quantify the factors affecting that collective action. We used two different approaches to measure the performance of collective action: a performance indicator based on soil conditions, and farmer's perceptions based on their satisfaction with the current level of management activities. The results using the two approaches were consistent, and indicated that, among other variables, dependency on pond water, pond size, and household size were important variables affecting the performance of collective action. There was also limited evidence that clarification of property rights through the use of contractors for pond management improved outcomes for farmers. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The influence of market orientation on firm performance and members' livelihood in Ethiopian seed producer cooperatives
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - The positive effects of market orientation and its components on firm performance are empirically supported by studies conducted for large firms in developed economies. However, its influence on performance in developing and emerging (D&E) economies, particularly under a cooperative's context, has been under-researched. This paper examines the impact of market orientation components on the performance of seed producer cooperatives (SPCs) in Ethiopia. Results show that customer orientation, interfunctional coordination, and supplier orientation, but not competitor orientation, contribute to higher business performance. Our findings confirm that customer orientation is the key factor for superior business performance in D&E economies. Business performance has a mediating effect between market orientation components and livelihood performance. Interfunctional coordination and supplier orientation influence the livelihood of member farmers both directly and indirectly via business performance. The study concludes that market orientation of SPCs is very important for business performance and provides a strong basis for the livelihood of seed producer families. SPCs can improve their performance and the livelihood of member-farmer families by implementing market oriented strategies, emphasising the key components of market orientation.

TI  - Rewriting China's Recent History: Fluctuations in State Economic Control, 1949-1984
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY
AB  - China's political and economic systems are often discussed in combination. It is generally believed that under the political system of centralization, the economic system had to be a state monopoly. This article challenges that view by providing an economic perspective. The period 1949-1984 is selected to explore the causes of successive periods of strengthening and weakening of the state's monopoly power over the economy. Scholars have generally assumed that the period of state monopoly originated from socialist ideology or the personal will of the leaders. But economic conditions severely limited the options available. After the new China was established, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) did not try to create a fully socialist economy in the short run. Instead, the CCP formulated a New Democracy platform that pragmatically allowed many types of enterprise to function side by side, including private industry, household ventures, and state-owned enterprises. The original plan of the CCP was to allow private enterprise to develop in order to build up capital to rebuild the war-damaged economy so that a strong foundation could be established for creating a socialist economy. But the Korean War from 1950 to 1953 and an influx of Soviet capital caused a shift from a mixed economy to state capitalism by 1956. From that point on, Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders had to change course again and again as fiscal crises limited available options. A reversal occurred in 1958 when the Soviets withdrew both their advisors and their capital subsidies, leaving the state capitalist system weakened. The crisis in the Chinese economy from 1959 to 1961 required decentralization of economic authority and efforts to promote rural capital formation. The next shift occurred after 1963 as the economy was organized to prepare for a possible military invasion. The required mobilization of industrial resources in remote regions of China inevitably reinforced state management of the economy. The final reversal occurred in the late 1970s, when imports of Western technology and equipment created another fiscal crisis for the central government, which then had to shift the burden of capital formation from the state to private entities. The reform of the rural household contract system, the adjustment of economic structures, and an increase in exports to gain foreign exchange all took place as part of "de-monopolization" reforms. The reforms that occurred after 1979 were not an aberration or a radical break from the past. They were part of a pattern that evolved from 1949 to 1984, with fluctuations dependent on the weakening and strengthening status of state finances. The shifts that occurred during this period have either been ignored by observers, or they have been misinterpreted as being motivated by ideology. In fact, new policies were created to enable the government to adjust to changes in the internal and external environment.

TI  - Adaptation strategies and land productivity of banana farmers under climate change in China
T2  - CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
AB  - Climate change has become a critical challenge to land productivity in developing countries. Adaptation strategies can increase farmers' resilience to climate change in agricultural production. Many studies have explored how farmers adapted to climate change on the underlying premise that they homogeneously have a complete knowledge about climate change adaptation strategies. However, the knowledge of smallholder farmers can be incomplete and heterogeneous particularly under climatic shocks. And the role of social network in farmers' adaptation decisions cannot be neglected. We specify social network into formal social tie (cooperative membership), and informal social tie (to local farmers and agricultural input retailers). This paper is the first attempt to examine the heterogeneous impact of social ties on farmers' adaptation decisions, and further assess the effect of adaptation strategies on land productivity under climate change using Augmented Inverse Probability Weights (AIPW) estimator, based on the primary data collected from banana farmers in China. The results show that 55 percent of banana farmers adopted adaptation strategies to mitigate the impact of climate change in farming practices. Out of eight coping strategies, diversifying crops, increasing chemical use, increasing irrigation and planting trees were prioritized measures used by banana farmers. Both formal and informal social ties of farmers exerted a significant impact on farmers' adaptation decisions. Participation in agricultural cooperatives and tie to agricultural input retailers increased farmers' uptake rate of adaptation strategies. In contrast, tie to local farmers hindered farmers from taking active actions to combat climate change. We also found that the adaptation strategies significantly increased the land productivity of banana farmers. Interestingly, the land productivity of adopters was more influenced by the formal social tie (cooperative membership); while the informal social tie (to agricultural input retailers) affected that of non-adopters. These findings highlight the importance of different social ties of smallholder farmers in designing policy package to increase their responses to climate change and improve land productivity in developing regions.

TI  - Exploring the influencing paths of natives' conservation behavior and policy incentives in protected areas: Evidence from China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - To enhance ecosystem conservation in protected areas, natives' behavior, mainly the use of natural resources or direct human disturbance to ecosystems, must be well intervened and regulated. To explore the determinants and incentives of the conservation behavior of natives, this paper establishes a theoretical behavior model emphasizing livelihood assets and conservation policy impacts, and specifies it with structural equation modeling. The protected areas of Chishui county in southwest China and the Three-River-Source National Park in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were selected for empirical analyses based on household surveys. Results show that conservation intentions that shape the natives' conservation behavior are collectively decided by conservation attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. Livelihood assets exert indirect positive effects on conservation behavior by influencing the aforementioned psychological variables. The impacts on conservation behavior of the governmental policy instruments, Grain to Green Program, Grassland Ecological Protection Subsidy and Incentive Policy, and Ecological Ranger Post Setting are evaluated. The command & control functions of the first two instruments are verified to be effective.The propaganda & education functions of all three policy instruments affect conservation intention and behavior by influencing conservation attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control of the natives. The ecological compensation functions of the policies prevent the loss of the natives' livelihood assets but fail to enhance it. The findings demonstrate that besides the direct impacts on conservation behavior of the protection policy instruments, the indirect policy impacts affecting the protection consciousness of natives should not be underestimated. In the long run, a suggestion is to strengthen eco-compensation to improve livelihood assets, to better promote the protection behavior of the local residents and obtain sustainable ecosystem conservation in the protected areas. This research demonstrates applicability and feasibility of the behavioral theory and causal model method in natural conservation study and shows strong policy implication. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Supplying Nairobi with organic products: some insights on farmer markets' organization
T2  - CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB  - Consumption of certified products is no longer the privilege of developed countries. In Kenya, the first organic markets appeared in 2006 in Nairobi. They were supplied by vegetable growers, facing different challenges: building a credible organic certification, maintaining products' freshness and dealing with the heterogeneity of consumers' expectations. Based on survey data and the transaction costs analytical framework, we analyze Kenyan organic markets between 2006 and 2013. We show that if the collective certification of producers enabled the creation of initial markets, the gradual abandonment of certification was not synonymous with the collapse of transactions. Actually, the organization of producers, which is "quasi-integrated", allowed for an efficient coordination with markets, helping to build a rent that the producers try to protect. On the other hand, interpersonal relations between producers and consumers resulting from direct sales, ensured the continuation of transactions despite the end of the certification and the related increasing uncertainty.

TI  - Smallholder wheat farmers' commercialization level and its determinants in northwestern Ethiopia
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study analyzes the commercial engagement of smallholder farmers in wheat commercialization at the farm level and the factors affecting this. A stratified three stage sampling technique was used to collect data from 195 smallholder wheat farmers. Descriptive and Tobit models were employed to analyze the collected data. The result of study identified that on average smallholder wheat farmers were relatively lacking in commercial activities as the mean commercialization index was found to be 0.21. The age category of a household head, quantity produced, distance to the nearest market, formal extension services, membership of farmers' cooperatives, climatic (early warning and preparedness) information, and perception towards lagged market prices were found to determine significantly the commercialization activities of wheat farmers. The commercialization level of wheat farmers can be increased by improving their understanding of commercial farming, strengthening the marketing system (accesses and infrastructure), increasing the number of adequate extension contacts, timely climatic information, making market relationships (forward and future contract) available, and increasing farmers involvement in farming cooperatives.

TI  - The role of input vouchers in modernizing the fresh fruit and vegetable market in Turkey
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Contractual arrangements between farmers and traders aiming at providing input/credit in return for output selling have been widely studied in the literature on agricultural economics. Nonetheless, there is one issue, which is barely mentioned in the literature: how to enforce the contract terms when traders offer credit in cash rather than input advances? This article aims to describe an innovation in farming contracts, used by fresh fruit and vegetable wholesalers in Turkey, which involves a kind of private voucher system. Drawing on original data collected from wholesalers-a segment in the supply chain hardly covered in the literature-we investigate the factors determining contract adoption using a two-limit Tobit model. Our results suggest that this private voucher system contributes to supply chain coordination and facilitates smallholder farmer participation in export and supermarket channels, which are growing rapidly in this developing country.

TI  - Land tenure security and farm efficiency in Indian agriculture: Revisiting an old debate
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - This paper examines the Marshallian inefficiency hypothesis of share tenancy system in agriculture of Odisha, Eastern India. It examines the hypothesis from a different perspective where it is argued that a secured land tenure system enhances farm efficiency even though it is sharecropping. We develop three hypotheses within the profit maximization framework and use the efficiency scores of paddy growers computed from the data envelop analysis (DEA) to verify them empirically. The 'latent variable regression model' results reveal that a secured land ownership status significantly augments farm efficiency. But the nature of tenancy contract (sharecropping and fixed-rent tenancy) makes no difference in farm efficiency. The policy implication of the study calls for tenancy reform in Odisha agriculture to make the tenancy a more secure one. Currently, the government of Odisha has banned the share tenancy. But a vast concealed tenancy comprising of marginal farmers and landless cultivators is in place. So any reform in this regard would benefit them directly.

TI  - The myth of community and sustainable grassland management in China
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
AB  - Within national and international domestic academic circles, there are increasing calls for enhanced involvement of communities in formulating and implementing grassland management arrangements. In contrast to the current national policy of contracting grasslands to households, many scholars call for support for collective grassland use arrangements. Several reasons are given for increased recognition and support for community-based management of grasslands, including lower costs of exclusion and dispute resolution, economies of scale in herding and marketing, mitigation of environmental risk, and ensuring equitable access to grassland resources. One conclusion from this literature is that devolving authority for designing and implementing grassland management systems to communities would lead to more sustainable grassland use, a position that I term as the 'myth of community.' This paper presents the results of a study of grazing systems in two communities in Hongyuan County, Sichuan Province. Each community uses its grasslands collectively. However, the study found evidence of severe overgrazing, especially in winter pastures, suggesting that community-based management of grasslands is not necessarily sustainable. The paper discusses three potential policy innovations required to support sustainable grazing systems in China's grassland areas: overcoming constraints in labor and land markets, and payments for environmental services that reward sustainable stocking levels.

TI  - Determinants of success and intensity of livestock feed technologies use in Ethiopia: Evidence from a positive deviance perspective
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - This study explores factors associated with success and intensity of livestock feed technologies use among positive deviants in feed technology adoption in Ethiopia. We used a nation-wide dataset of over 603 farm households, which surveyed pockets of successes in using improved livestock feed technologies. Heckman two-stage estimation procedures were used to identify factors associated with success and intensity of livestock feed technology use simultaneously. Results from the first stage of selection equation show that households socioeconomic and institutional factors such as education status of the head, herd size, exercise in feed technology utilization, cooperative membership, distance to district center, and diverse use of technologies have significant effect on success in livestock feed technologies adoption. The second stage demonstrates that intensity of household collaboration or network, membership in livestock related cooperatives, training, access to livestock feed technologies with packages, diverse use of technologies, engagement in livestock enterprises, livestock management system, willingness to invest more in feed technologies, and agro-ecologies significantly influence the intensity of feed technologies use. These results suggest that success and intensified use of improved feed technologies demand different entry strategies for risk factors, enablers, and behaviors, which may differ from the classic agricultural technologies transfer system. These include availability of appropriate biophysical and resource environments, functional linkages between different actors, access to inputs and social capital, and enabling institutional support system. Moreover, this study shows that when there is limited adoption, few pockets of success in improved technologies use, positive deviant approach would be more informative to understand the underlying factors and principles for success and intensified use of technologies than the most commonly reported conventional adoption rate studies.

TI  - Private agricultural colonization on a Brazilian frontier, 1970-1980
T2  - JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Private colonization is the use of companies and cooperatives to survey, demarcate and occupy land, build infrastructure, open roads, plan urban areas, and provide health services and education. Although state-directed colonization projects are strongly implicated in recent environmental and social changes in the Brazilian Amazon, areas settled by private colonization were larger than state-led settlement. The paper considers this poorly examined aspect of the region's recent settlement history by focusing upon a colonization cooperative and private company that settled smallholders from southern Brazil to eastern Mato Grosso State between 1970 and 1980. The analysis emphasizes how private colonization cooperatives successfully secured land title, setting the stage for subsequent commercial agricultural development. This study rejects prevailing interpretations of private colonization as a tool of authoritarian government in Brazil. Rather, private colonization secured land tenure and organized an economically viable production system in a frontier environment of unpredictable state bureaucracies, high transaction costs, risk, and precarious markets.

TI  - Reflexive Consumer Markets as Opportunities for New Peasant Farmers in Mexico and France: Constructing Food Sovereignty Through Alternative Food Networks
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Alternate food networks (AFN) in Mexico and France are seen as an anti-systemic, post-capitalist social behavior and a form of anticommodity production. We report on two local market initiatives in Mexico, comparing similar institutions in southern France. Despite the adverse situation facing peasant agriculture, consumers and producers-urban and rural-are mobilizing to vindicate the ethical, agroecological, and cultural dimensions of food and support the smallholder family economy, seeking more direct, face-to-face relationships. The participation of women in AFN is definitive, as consumers, producers, and processors, and as organizers and promoters as well. AFN are one dimension of a process of the "Return of the Peasants," that is, ideological spaces where farmers and consumers collectively are redefining the values of the agro-food system.

TI  - Inequity in Health Services Utilization in Economically Underdeveloped Regions of Northeast China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundThe Chinese health system has long been committed to eliminating inequalities in health services utilization. However, few studies have analyzed or measured these inequalities in economically underdeveloped regions in China. MethodsA total of 6,627 respondents from 3,000 households in Heilongjiang Province were extracted from the Sixth National Health Services Survey. We measured horizontal inequity in both 2-week outpatient rate and annual inpatient rate, and then identified the factors contributing to inequality. ResultsThe horizontal inequity indices of the 2-week outpatient and annual impatient rates in Heilongjiang Province were 0.0586 and 0.1276, respectively. Household income, health status, place of residence, basic medical insurance, and commercial health insurance were found to be the main factors affecting inequality in health services utilization. The contributions of household income to these two indices were 184.03 and 253.47%, respectively. Health status factors, including suffering from chronic disease, limitations in daily activities, and poor self-rated health, played positive roles in reducing inequality in these two indices. The contributions of place of residence to these two indices were 27.21 and -28.45%, respectively. Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance made a pro-rich contribution to these two indices: 56.25 and 81.48%, respectively. Urban and Rural Resident Basic Medical Insurance, Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance, New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme, and other basic medical insurance made a pro-poor contribution to these two indices: -73.51 and -54.87%, respectively. Commercial health insurance made a pro-rich contribution to these two indices: 20.79 and 7.40%, respectively. Meanwhile, critical illness insurance made a slightly pro-poor contribution to these two indices: -4.60 and -0.90%, respectively. ConclusionsThe findings showed that the "equal treatment in equal need" principle was not met in the health services utilization context in Heilongjiang Province. To address this issue, the government could make policy changes to protect low-income populations from underused health services, and work to improve basic medical insurance, critical illness insurance, and social security systems.

TI  - Economic impact of highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in Western Java smallholder broiler farms
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 is considered endemic in most parts of Indonesia and constitutes an important risk for broiler production, especially in Western Java which has the highest poultry population in the country. Most broiler farms in Western Java are smallholder farms that operate under different business types: independent (i.e., revenues based on market price and live bird weight), price-contract (i.e., revenues based on a contract selling price and live bird weight) or makloon (i.e., revenues based on a management fee per sold bird). Many studies focus on the epidemiological impacts of HPAI at the regional level, and insights into the economic impact at the farm level are scarce, especially in the Indonesian context. Meanwhile, a single HPAI outbreak could disrupt smallholder broiler farmers' primary source of income. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the economic impact of HPAI outbreaks under different response scenarios (i.e., no action, stamping out, and early selling) on typical Western Java smallholder broiler farms. Furthermore, the effect of different farm business types and the existence of a sick-bird market on the economic effects of HPAI outbreaks were evaluated. We developed a dynamic stochastic bio-economic simulation model to simulate epidemiological and economic impacts of HPAI outbreaks on a typical Western Java smallholder broiler farm during one production round. Our results show that the economic consequences of HPAI outbreaks for independent and pricecontract farms are considerable, ranging from, on average, 1.2-62.7 million Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) losses (euro76.9 to euro3919), depending on the moment of and response to infection, compared to an expected gross margin of 5.3 million IDR (euro331) under normal circumstances. The economic loss for makloon farms was substantially lower than for other business types, reducing their incentive to implement biosecurity. The economic impacts were sensitive to changes in a diverse set of parameters, including disease transmission rate, detection threshold, and stamping-out compensation. The losses in a scenario with stamping out were higher than in other scenarios, especially when stamping out happened near the end of the production round. Moreover, reacting to an outbreak by selling chickens early gave the lowest economic losses, incentivizing farmers to engage in behavior with a high disease transmission risk. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that it is important to consider the economic perspective of individual farmers when designing HPAI mitigation programs. Financial incentives for farmers to control HPAI differ largely between farm business types.

TI  - A Socio-Ecological Investigation of Options to Manage Groundwater Degradation in the Western Desert, Egypt
T2  - AMBIO
AB  - Under increasing water scarcity, collective groundwater management is a global concern. This article presents an interdisciplinary analysis of this challenge drawing on a survey including 50 large and small farms and gardens in a village in an agricultural land reclamation area on the edge of the Western Desert of Egypt. Findings revealed that smallholders rely on a practice of shallow groundwater use, through which drainage water from adjacent irrigation areas is effectively recycled within the surface aquifer. Expanding agroindustrial activities in the surrounding area are socio-economically important, but by mining non-renewable water in the surrounding area, they set in motion a degradation process with social and ecological consequences for all users in the multi-layered aquifer system. Based on the findings of our investigation, we identify opportunities for local authorities to more systematically connect available environmental information sources and common pool resource management precedents, to counterbalance the degradation threat.

TI  - Can Property Rights Reform of China's Agricultural Water Facilities Improve the Quality of Facility Maintenance and Enhance Farmers' Water Conservation Behavior?-A Typical Case from Yunnan Province, China
T2  - WATER
AB  - Currently, China is facing the problems of chaotic governance of end-use agricultural water conservancy facilities and a serious waste of agricultural water. To address the above issues, China launched a pilot policy of reforming the property rights of agricultural water facilities in 2014. In this study, we obtained data from 328 farm households through a microscopic study of the pilot property rights reform in Yunnan Province. We found that the reform has resulted in two typical property rights models: "Multiple cooperative governance" and "Private contract governance". The impact of the reform on the maintenance quality of irrigation facilities and farmers' water-saving technology adoption behavior was empirically analyzed using the Oprobit and IV-Oprobit methods. The study found that: (1) the property rights reform significantly improved the quality of maintenance of facilities while promoting farmers' water-saving technology adoption behavior. (2) Heterogeneity analysis revealed that the degree of non-farming of farmers had a negative moderating effect on the quality of facility maintenance and a positive moderating effect on the adoption of water-saving technologies, and the physical health of farmers had a negative moderating effect on the quality of facility maintenance. (3) There was no significant difference in the quality of facility maintenance between the "Private contract model" and the "Multiple cooperative governance model", but the former had higher water supply capacity; in addition, farmers under the "Multiple cooperative governance model" mainly used drip irrigation technology, whereas farmers under the "Private contract governance model" mainly used sprinkler irrigation technology. The findings of this study provide Chinese experience in promoting the governance of agricultural water facilities and promoting the water-saving behavior of farmers.

TI  - Variation in Output Shares and Endogenous Matching in Land Rental Contracts: Evidence from Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We investigate the extent of variation in output sharing in land rental contracts and alternative hypotheses to explain this variation. Close to half of the rental contracts in our study in northern Ethiopia have output shares that deviate from the dominant 50-50 equal sharing. Variation in land quality, the relative bargaining power of landlords and tenants, production risks and shocks are hypothesised to influence output shares. Matched data of landlords and tenants are used. The importance of endogenous matching of landlords and tenants is investigated by assessing how endogenous tenant characteristics are correlated with landlord characteristics. We find evidence of negative assortative matching for key resource characteristics. A control function approach is used to control for endogenous matching in the output share models. The results reveal that production risks, as well as relative bargaining power, affect output shares in the reverse tenancy setting where tenants are relatively wealthier and more influential than landlords.

TI  - Prevalence of tick-borne haemoparasites and their perceived co-occurrences with viral outbreaks of FMD and LSD and their associated factors
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Species of Theileria, Babesia, and Anaplasma are Tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) that are prevalent throughout the world, particularly in the tropical and subtropical regions. Associated diseases of Theileriosis, Babesiosis, and Anaplasmosis, respectively, represents a major threat to livestock production in many countries. TBPs have a high prevalence in different geographical locations in Egypt. Foot and mouth disease (FMD) and Lumpy skin disease (LSD) are considered endemic bovine viral diseases in Egypt. Our clinical observations during the epidemics of LSD and FMD viruses showed higher prevalence rates for the TBPs. To investigate this correlation, a total of 670 samples from cattle and buffalo were collected during the summers of 2017 and 2018 distributed throughout ranches and smallholders in two geographical locations in Egypt. Two farms with a recent clinical outbreak of LSD with a total of 270 animals, while the other location included three farms with a recent FMD outbreak with a combined 400 cattle. Examined animals were classified mainly according to age, gender, species, breed (native versus crossbred), and the presence of ticks. Whole blood samples were collected for TBPs and viral (LSD and FMD) examinations, while tissue specimens were collected for detection of FMD and LSD viruses by real-time PCR.
   Our results confirmed significantly higher prevalence rates for the TBPs in LSD-positive than LSD-negative animals, while no significant difference could be detected for the prevalence rate of the TBPs in the FMD positive and negative groups. The prevalence of Babesia and Theileria was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in crossbreeds than native cattle. Infections with Anaplasma and co-infections with Babesia-Anaplasma and Theileria-Anaplasma were significantly higher in native than cross-breeds cattle. The intensity of parasitic infection (parasitemia) has a significant difference in the positive groups for the two viruses compared to the negative groups. These results collectively confirming the enhancing role of LSD on the prevalence rate of the haemoprotozoal infections leading to more serious outcomes to the livestock infections, and therefore the control of haemoprotozoal infections should be implemented as a part of viral epidemics control.

TI  - Estimating the effects of joining cooperatives on farmers' recycling behaviors of pesticide packaging waste: insights from apple farmers of China
T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
AB  - The improper disposal of pesticide packaging wastes (PPW) has posed serious harm to the environment, including groundwater and soil pollution and even health concerns to the public. To address the environmental concerns and public health issues, there is a need to recycle the pesticides packaging waste (RPPW). Though small fanners in many developing countries have joined the cooperatives to reduce the production costs and increase the product premium, how these cooperatives improve fanners' RPPW behaviors is still sparse. The current study used data collected from 725 apple farmers in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces of China to explore the phenomenon empirically. Recycling decisions and degree are used to portray the farmers' RPPW behaviors. Firstly, the Logit model was used to analyze the effect of joining cooperatives on farmers recycling decisions. Further, to address the sample selection bias, the present study employed the propensity score matching (PSM) method for empirical analysis concerning the effect of joining cooperatives on farmers' recycling degree. Results showed that joining cooperatives positively and significantly influences farmers' recycling decisions. If farmers join a cooperative, the probability of the recycling decisions and degree will increase by 20.30% and 27.50%, respectively. Moreover, it is also found that some other factors such as education level, environmental and public health risk perception, peer effect, and relationship network also significantly influence farmers' recycling decisions. Moreover, considering the differences in fanners' gender, age, and educational attainment. the study unveiled the heterogeneous effects of joining cooperatives on farmers' RPPW behaviors. The findings revealed that gender and age variables have noticeable masking effects while education level has a typical threshold effect. The overall findings provided insights for policymakers to emphasize the development of agricultural cooperatives, improve the risk and interest linkage mechanism, and build the RPPW system. These implications are also supportive for policymakers in other developing countries.

TI  - Are smallholder farmers willing to pay for different types of crop insurance? An application of labelled choice experiments to Chinese corn growers
T2  - GENEVA PAPERS ON RISK AND INSURANCE-ISSUES AND PRACTICE
AB  - Crop insurance is the most common agricultural risk management instrument. In developing countries, crop insurance is becoming popular but is often provided with lower coverage, lower premiums and less subsidy than in developed countries. We use a labelled choice experiment method to investigate Chinese smallholder corn growers' preferences for alternative types of insurance. In addition to traditional yield insurance, we assess farmers' willingness to pay for coverage levels in price, revenue and weather index insurance, which are currently at the experimental stage in China. We find farmer preferences for these various types of insurance to be heterogeneous. On average, farmers are willing to pay for all types of insurance and for additional coverage but only at the current high subsidy level. We explore heterogeneity in willingness to pay and find that farmers' positive past insurance experience plays a very important role in their demand for insurance.

TI  - Land expropriation in urbanizing China: an examination of negotiations and compensation
T2  - URBAN GEOGRAPHY
AB  - A driving force of urban development is "accumulation by dispossession" which occurs through expropriation, privatization, and commodification of land. While the macro theory is now well refined, there is still much we do not know about how the underlying processes occur and how they shape economic development and urbanization. In this study, we analyze 2009 survey data of land expropriation cases across 12 Chinese cities, and find that expropriation takes different forms leading to specific outcomes. In half the cases, local governments followed central government policies requiring them to pay standard rates of compensation, but in the other half, local governments negotiated with farmers over the terms of expropriation. In the latter scenario, farmers were more likely to receive compensation higher than the standard rate, particularly if they were embedded in local power structures, which we argue could be counteracted if all households in a rural collective negotiate one agreement rather than individual agreements. These findings move us closer to understanding why accumulation through dispossession sometimes contributes to economic growth and social development, and at other times undermines urban development leading to social instability.

TI  - A mixed-methods approach to understanding water use and water infrastructure in a schistosomiasis-endemic community: case study of Asamama, Ghana
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Surface water contaminated with human waste may transmit urogenital schistosomiasis (UGS). Water-related activities that allow skin exposure place people at risk, but public health practitioners know little about why some communities with access to improved water infrastructure have substantial surface water contact with infectious water bodies. Community-based mixed-methods research can provide critical information about water use and water infrastructure improvements.
   Methods: Our mixed-methods study assessed the context of water use in a rural community endemic for schistosomiasis.
   Results: Eighty-seven (35.2 %) households reported using river water but not borehole water; 26 (10.5 %) reported using borehole water but not river water; and 133 (53.8 %) households reported using both water sources. All households are within 1 km of borehole wells, but tested water quality was poor in most wells. Schistosomiasis is perceived by study households (89.3 %) to be a widespread problem in the community, but perceived schistosomiasis risk fails to deter households from river water usage. Hematuria prevalence among schoolchildren does not differ by household water use preference. Focus group data provides context for water preferences. Demand for improvements to water infrastructure was a persistent theme; however, roles and responsibilities with respect to addressing community water and health
   concerns are ill-defined. Conclusions: Collectively, our study illustrates how complex attitudes towards water resources can affect which methods will be appropriate to address schistosomiasis.

Tobacco leaf is a mainstay of the economy, accounting for about 10% of the country's GDP in 2018. Methods We use descriptive and regression analyses from a face-to-face survey of 381 smallholder farmers in three major tobacco-farming areas in Manicaland province to determine the prevalence of tobacco-related debt and some of its covariates. The survey was conducted in June and July 2019. Results 74% of respondents are contract farmers and 26% are independent farmers. 57% of respondents indicated that they were in tobacco-related debt. The likelihood of being in tobacco-related debt is significantly more than average for farmers with the following characteristics (holding other characteristics constant): being a contract farmer, having a larger farm, employing only family labour and not recording expenses (as a proxy for financial sophistication). 91% of contract farmers would prefer to be independent farmers, while 63% of independent farmers would prefer to be contract farmers. Conclusion There is no evidence to suggest that tobacco growing, in its current state, has benefited the tobacco farmers in Manicaland province. Tobacco farmers are largely victims, rather than beneficiaries, of the sector. There is a strong case for government intervention to improve the conditions of tobacco farmers, either through direct intervention in the tobacco-growing sector, or by encouraging and promoting crop substitution.

TI  - Contract farming and sustainable agricultural development: some issues
T2  - TRIA-TERRITORIO DELLA RICERCA SU INSEDIAMENTI E AMBIENTE
AB  - This paper deals with the concept of contract farming in the purview of National Agricultural Policy (2000) which encouraged private participation through contract farming. The conception of contract farming is nothing new in India but it gets momentum in the era of agricultural globalization. As an alternative method of farming it becomes popular to Indian farmer. The issues relating to contract farming such as sustainable agricultural development, advantages to the farmers and sponsors, problems faced by the farmers and sponsors, problems to introducing contract farming in India, governments responsibility etc. have been discussed in this article elaborately. The study reveals that in Indian context introduction of contract farming has two fold effects, positive and negative in favour of farmers and sponsors. But in the perspective of sustainable agricultural development it has a significant impact.

TI  - The economics and optimal management regimes of eucalyptus plantations: A case study of forestry outgrower schemes in Brazil
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The main aims of this study are to assess the economic viability and identify the optimal management regimes of eucalypt forests within the framework of an outgrower scheme, at Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Outgrower schemes are partnership contracts that encourage smallholders/farmers to consider reforestation in addition to their agricultural crops. The company provides inputs and seedlings for planting in exchange for the exclusive right of timber purchase at harvest time. The cash flows of tree growers and forest company are evaluated using the Net Present Value and Average Production Cost for the project, with and without the outgrower scheme. The management regimes are evaluated by Linear Programming (LP), the objective function of which is to maximize the Equivalent Annuity (EA) of 144 farms with outgrower schemes. There has been an increase in the profitability of tree growers enrolled in the program for an economic radius of 160 km, showing the importance of incentives for eucalyptus plantations in small and medium farms. By LP, 10 management prescriptions common to the 144 farms were selected. It was observed that 15% of the 144 outgrower schemes analyzed did not have an economical prescription. A 10% reduction in the current wood price would increase this amount to 39%. Furthermore, with discriminant analysis of the 10 selected management prescriptions, it was possible to create a classification rule for new partnership contracts, with a 80% success rate.

TI  - The role of time preferences in contract breach: Evidence from Chinese poultry farmers participating in contract farming
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB  - Farmers' contract breach behavior is cited as one of the major stumbling blocks in the sustainable expansion of contract farming in many developing countries. This paper examines farmers' contract breach decisions from the perspective of time preferences. The empirical analysis is based on a household survey and economic field experiments of poultry households participating in contract farming conducted in Jiangsu Province, China. A discounted utility model and a maximum likelihood technique are applied to estimate farmers' time preferences and the effect of time preferences on contract breach in the production and sales phases are explored with a bivariate probit model. The results show that, on average, the poultry farmers in the sample are generally present biased and impatient regarding future utility. The regression results show that farmers with a higher preference for the present and a higher discount rate are more likely to breach contracts, and time preferences play a greater role in the production phase than in the sales phase. When considering heterogeneity, specific investments and transaction costs promote contract stability only for farmers with a low degree of impatience. Moreover, compared with large-scale farmers, small-scale farmers' contract breach decisions are more significantly affected by their time preferences. These results have implications for contract stability policies and other issues that are impacted by the linking of behavioral preferences to agricultural decisions.

TI  - Intersectionality shapes adaptation to social-ecological change
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - People from across the Caylloma Province of Peru are adapting to social-ecological changes, such as decreasing water supplies and rapidly retreating glaciers, in different and unequal ways. In this study, we show how this inequality is intersectional; identities like gender and age compound and interact with systems of power to shape how people adapt to these changes at the individual, household, and district scales. We draw from 130 semi-structured interviews with agricultural actors and participant observations in district and regional meetings across four districts, to demonstrate how intersectionality shapes adaptation to social-ecological change. Our results show (1) what social-ecological changes are perceived and experienced, (2) how individuals, households, and groups within the agricultural sector adapt to these changes in private (at the individual and household scale) and public adaptation spaces (institutions where people adapt collectively within each district), and (3) how intersectionality shapes adaptive capacity to these changes. Specifically, we found that 'unskilled' women diversified their income through day-labor in agriculture, while 'unskilled' men had more options for income diversification. Migrants who are also renters had access to water; however, migrants who lived in informal settlements lacked water access. Pastoralists over 50 faced more difficulties pursuing income diversification and labor migration than younger populations with similar livelihoods. Public adaptation spaces, including irrigation commissions, were largely designed for Spanish-speaking men who own land, which caused additional barriers for Quechua speakers, women, and migrants who used this space to contribute to adaptation for themselves, their household, and for the broader district. Together, these results expand scholarship on differential adaptation to social-ecological change within globally marginalized, yet locally heterogenous, communities. In particular, this study brings to light how intersecting identities, along with the social, political and economic structures in which they are situated, can lead to unequal adaptation opportunities within heterogeneous communities.

TI  - Classification-based forest management program and farmers' income: evidence from collective forest area in southern China
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose This article's purpose is to examine the effect of a Classification-Based Forest Management (CFM) program on farmers' income and determine whether its effect varies with the degree of farmers' concurrent occupations. Design/methodology/approach The authors use representative panel survey data from Longquan to explore the welfare effects of CFM on farmers. The analysis uses differences-in-differences with propensity score matching (PSM-DID) estimation techniques to deal with endogeneity problems when farmers make the decision to participate in CFM. Findings The results show that CFM has a positive effect on part-time forestry households (where forestry income accounts for between 5 and 50% of total income). In contrast, it has a negative impact on full-time forestry households (forestry income accounts for more than 50%), and no clear effect on nonforestry households whose forestry income is less than 5%. This research also shows that the positive effect of CFM on farmers' total income is mainly due to increase of off-farm income driven by CFM, while the negative effects consist of CFM's reduction of forestry income. Originality/value The extent of CFM's economic benefits to farmers is uncertain and largely unexplored. This paper analyzes the impact of CFM on income structure to explore the mechanisms explaining its effects on farmers' income. There are still challenges in ensuring the reliability and accuracy of CFM assessment. This paper collected natural experimental data and used the estimation technology of PSM-DID to solve the possible endogeneity problems.

TI  - Cotton farmers' adaptation to arid climates: Waiting times to adopt water-saving technology
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB  - Water-saving irrigation technology is an effective way for agriculture to adapt to the arid climate. Shortening farmers' waiting times to adopt such technology is important for saving water resources and stabilizing agricultural production. This study analyzed the impact of capital endowment on Xinjiang cotton farmers' adoption willingness, adoption decisions, and waiting time. Results showed that capital endowments significantly affect cotton farmers' adoption of water-saving technologies (WST) in all dimensions. Specifically, the scale of cotton planting had a significant positive impact on the willingness and decision of cotton farmers to adopt WST, and it could significantly reduce the adoption wait time. Simultaneously, neighbors' adoption decisions, policy subsidies, and membership of a cooperative could reduce cotton farmers' wait times. Land transfer was one of the livelihood strategies cotton farmers used to adjust household resource allocations or to adapt to arid climate. Land rental also could help reduce the wait time for WST. These results and impacts provided policy optimization direction to reduce the waiting time of farmers to adopt water-saving technology, which was helpful to save agricultural water and for farmers adapt to drought climate change quickly. At the end of the study, combined with the situation of China, from the crop planting structure, land system reform, and effective community governance, we discussed several research directions to improve farmers' drought climate adaptability.

TI  - Climate perceptions, farmers' willingness-to-insure farms and resilience to climate change in Northern region, Ghana
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study analysed farmer's perceptions on climate change, their willingness-to-insure their farms and their recovery from or resilience to climate shocks. This involved 209 farmers that were selected through a multistage sampling procedure in the Northern region of Ghana. The data was analysed using double hurdle and ordered probit regressions. From the result, the study established that most of the farmers were willing-to-insure their farms and were willing-to-pay a positive price for farm insurance. The decision to insure farm was significantly influenced by education, farmer group membership and floods. On the other hand, farmer group membership, remitters, windstorm, climate perception and location in a rich class district, extension access, commercial production, floods, drought and off-farm diversification significantly influenced the premium farmers were willing to pay. It is concluded that most of the farmers recover faster from climate shocks as nearly all the farmers indicated an ability to recover from climate shocks with shorter time periods. Generally, the factors that had significant effect on the recovery period of the farmers were age, education, number of children, access to extension service, contract farming, farmer group membership, farm size, sex, number of household adults, access to credit and farm insurance. Therefore, farm insurance is an important strategy of making farming households recover faster from climate shocks. As such, there is the need to introduce farm insurance policies to crop farmers in the region at an agreed price between farmers and insurance providers.

TI  - New configurations in Brazilian agribusiness: rural warehouse condominiums
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the development of rural warehouses condominiums (or "condos") as new rural configurations in the Brazilian agribusiness from the perspective of the theory of collective action. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review was complemented with multiple case studies based on interviews and direct observation. Content analysis was used to interpret the secondary and primary data. Findings Rural warehouse condos can be characterized as a collective action which is a new business model in Brazilian agribusiness. This new initiative has several advantages: reduction of the warehouse deficit and other logistical bottlenecks; strategic commercialization of production; reduction of logistical costs; inclusion of smallholders in the economy and, consequently, the generation of income for smallholders and their participation in the market.
   Originality/value Rural warehouse condos are expanding mainly in the south region of Brazil, where smallholders are concentrated. In this new configuration, they can engage in an association to obtain several benefits, such as reduced logistics costs, better access to financing and increased bargaining power with suppliers. As this research dealt with a relatively new and poorly studied topic, it contributes to the development of new studies to map innovative warehousing practices.

TI  - Impact of socio-economic status on the implementation of China's collective forest tenure reform in Zhang Guying Township, Hunan: potential for increasing disparity
T2  - FORESTRY
AB  - China's collective forest tenure reform will have a profound impact on the livelihoods of rural people. For the equitable implementation of reform, rural smallholders need sufficient knowledge and understanding of the opportunities and limitations offered by reform. Here, we examine rural smallholder's awareness and attitude towards the reform, across the socio-economic range, in three villages of Zhang Guying Township, Hunan province. Income level and educational background played a consistent role in knowledge and understanding of the reform, as people with low income and no formal education were more likely to be unaware and have no clear understanding of the reform. Additionally, low -income rural smallholders were more likely to convert forest to cash crops, undercutting the central government's stated objectives for the forest reform to improve forest condition. Given our results, the government needs to ensure equitable distribution of information, specifically targeting low-income villagers without formal education. The strong disparity in knowledge and understanding between wealthy and poor creates a situation where the wealthy effectively benefit from the reform, while the poor miss its opportunity. This inequality has great potential for generating future unrest and conflict and for damaging forest condition due to unsustainable or uninformed practices.

TI  - Pump-and-treat method to remove nitrate from groundwater with liquor as the carbon source
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB  - As a common pollutant in groundwater, nitrate poses a significant threat to drinking water safety, especially in rural areas. A feasible solution to this problem must be established. In this study, a simple sand bucket was designed to investigate the capability of denitrification with liquor as the carbon source to remove nitrate from pumped groundwater, and the feasibility of the pump-and-treat method. Results showed that addition of a proper amount of liquor enhanced the growth and metabolism of denitrifying bacteria, efficiently reduced the nitrate content in pumped groundwater, and restricted the accumulation of intermediate products. The removal rate of nitrate exceeded 99% and reached about 16.0 mg/L/day when the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio was higher than 0.8. The accumulated concentration of nitrite as an intermediate was less than 1.0 mg/L when the C/N ratio was higher than 1.5. However, acetate accumulation was significant. Considering the accumulation of intermediates, the appropriate range of the C/N ratio should be 1.5-1.8. In addition, onset and maintenance of denitrification were not significantly influenced by dissolved oxygen and pH. The pump-and-treat method can provide a convenient and practical channel for household or collective removal of nitrate from pumped groundwater in rural areas because liquor as a household drink is frequently accessible and inexpensive in many areas.

TI  - Are Farmers in National Park Communities Willing to Reallocate Their Lands? A Situational Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Limited by China's mixed land ownership model, which is divided into collective and state ownership, national parks' strict ecological protection measures of restricting land use patterns and intensity are subject to the decisions made by collective landowners and contract operators, namely, rural households in national park communities. The disposition and intention of community farmers regarding collective land ownership is related to the nature conservation effect of the national park. In the context of national park land functions for ecological conservation, environmental education, leisure and recreation, scientific research, and "nest eggs" (basic living guarantees), the research on the influencing factors of farmers' intentions to reallocate their land (expropriated or transferred) will provide a basis for a National Parks Administration (NPA) to develop supporting policies for collective land reallocation in different functional zones and to prevent community conflicts. The research took Shennongjia National Park as an example and, combined with literature analysis, used the Structural Equation Model (SEM) to explore the influencing factors of community farmers' land reallocation intentions and drew the following conclusions: farmers' intentions to leave their land for nature conservation purposes and for urbanization purposes are different. In the five land function situations above, farmers' perceptions of land function in national parks did not directly affect their land reallocation intentions, while their trust in the land management ability of NPA was a complete mediator. Farmers' preferences for the economic value of land had no significant moderating effect on land reallocation intentions. Farmers' characteristics have a moderating effect on different land function situation models. Older and less educated farmers are more likely to receive livelihood compensation rather than monetary compensation after leaving their land. Therefore, some management suggestions are put forward, such as strengthening the capacity for building national park land and other natural resources management, adapting to the collective land policy in different function zones, and paying attention to the livelihood compensation of community farmers after they leave the land.

TI  - Food and energy subsidy reforms in Iran: A general equilibrium analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING
AB  - In 2010, the Iranian Government launched several market-oriented reforms, including the removal of distortions on heavily subsidized food and energy products. We use a microconsistent CGE model with 20 urban and rural households to model the actual characteristics of the food and energy subsidy reforms as implemented by the Iranian Government, calibrated to econometrically estimated income elasticities, and accounting for variations in sources of income and family size across households. Results suggest that food and energy subsidy reforms accompanied by lump-sum payments to households could result in aggregate welfare gains of over 45 per cent, with low income households experiencing welfare gains of well over 100 per cent. Reforms are accompanied by an increase in real government revenue of over 30 per cent. So while the subsidy reform programme is likely responsible for at least some of the inflationary pressures currently being experienced by the Iranian economy, it should not be seen as being responsible for the Iranian government's current fiscal difficulties, nor should it be blamed for the recent contraction of the Iranian economy, both of which are more likely due to the effects of international sanctions and the steep decline in the value of the Iranian Rial.

TI  - TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY OF SMALLHOLDER POULTRY FARMERS IN AKURE SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, ONDO STATE, NIGERIA
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The study examined the technical efficiency of smallholder poultry farmers in Akure South Local Government Area, Ondo State, Nigeria. The study used a multi-stage sampling procedure to select eighty respondents with the aid of structured questionnaire. The primary data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics, budgeting analysis and the stochastic frontier production function model. Findings revealed that majority (65%) of the respondents were male. The mean age of the respondents was 40 years. About 66.3% of the respondents were married and majority (85.0%) of the respondents were literate with at least primary school education. The mean of farming experience was 7years, indicating that most of the farmers were new entrants into the poultry business. The findings indicated that poultry production by smallholder farmers was a profitable enterprise in the study area. The results of the stochastic frontier analysis revealed that farming experience, access to credit facilities, membership of cooperative association and extension contact influenced the technical efficiency of smallholder poultry farmers in the study area. It was therefore, recommended that government should work on providing credit access to farmers while also stimulating agricultural extension programs through educational and research institutions. Also, farmers should come together often so that they can pool resources together and easily get the government's attention.

TI  - Dairy agripreneurs' preference for production and animal health support services in Kenya-a choice experiment
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - Utilization of production and animal health services among smallholder dairy agripreneurs is crucial in enhancing their productivity and income levels. However, studies have documented low uptake of these services among smallholder dairy agripreneurs in Kenya. This study utilizes a choice experiment (CE) to determine dairy agripreneurs' preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for five attributes of production and animal health support services. Multistage sampling procedure was used to collect data from 682 dairy farmers in Murang'a County. Data were analysed using Random Parameter Logit (RPL)/Mixed Logit model. The results of CE reveal significant heterogeneity in preference among dairy agripreneurs. Dairy agripreneurs prefer to have group marketing services offered rather than selling on individual basis. They also prefer curative services rather than preventive services. In addition, dairy agripreneurs prefer use of artificial insemination in improving productivity of cows rather than using improved feeds such as hay and silage. The results further indicate that dairy agripreneurs have less preference for business plan training service. In relation to willingness to pay (WTP), dairy agripreneurs were more willing to pay for group marketing (KES 8797.91/month), artificial insemination (KES 2816.01/month) and curative services (KES 2577.62/month). Lastly, dairy agripreneurs were not willing to forgo KES 2411.29 per month for business plan training service. Service providers should consider the differences in preferences among dairy agripreneurs to increase the uptake of production and animal health services in dairy agrienterprises.

TI  - Tobacco Farmers and Their Communities: Interlinkages, Gains and Losses in Mazowe, Zimbabwe
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - This article investigates spillover effects from the interlinked transactions arising from smallholder tobacco farmers' participation in contract farming arrangements in the Mazowe district of Mashonaland Central. The case study is based on data from a household survey conducted in the district and includes both tobacco farmers and households that do not produce tobacco. Interviews, participant observation and a review of statistical data and grey literature helped trace dynamics of production, intra-household relations and changing communal relations. The study explores how social relations and power imbalances shape the distribution of benefits, costs and losses resulting from the adoption of contract farming in the production of tobacco. The paper argues that the adoption of contract farming leads to a range of interlinked transactional outcomes, such as the diversification of agricultural production and new investments into non-farm activities by the poorer members of the community. In turn, these interlinked transactions generate jobs and increase food consumption and effective demand for services at the community level. However, it is also the case that the gains from these interlinked transactions are highly skewed against the poorer people in the district and that wealthier and better-connected farmers gain more from adopting tobacco than their less wealthy and less well-connected peers. This could lead to increased inequality in the community. The paper shows how agricultural dynamism generates spillover and multiplier effects that benefit communities in an unequal and poorly understood manner.

TI  - How much more do growers receive for Fair Trade-organic coffee?
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - I use a representative sample of coffee growing households in southern Mexico to estimate the price premium and gross income gain from participating in Fair Trade-organic markets through grower cooperatives. For the 2004-2005 season, FT-organic growers received an average premium of 12.8 cents per pound. yielding a gross income gain of 5% of total household income or about 26 dollars per household member. The gain is net of the costs of cooperative participation but not of other costs incurred to become certified and suggests that price premiums alone have a limited potential to increase household returns from growing coffee.

TI  - A survey of livestock losses caused by Asiatic wild dogs, leopards and tigers, and of the impact of predation on the livelihood of farmers in Bhutan
T2  - WILDLIFE RESEARCH
AB  - Context. Human-wildlife conflict is a serious impediment to conservation efforts worldwide. This is also true for Bhutan, where dholes or wild dogs (Cuon alpinus), leopards and tigers constitute a menace to the livestock of farmers. Livestock losses as a result depredation by wild animals is a major cause of conflict with farmers, threatening their livelihoods, and causing a negative attitude that can lead to retaliatory killing of wildlife.
   Aims. To survey farmers and document their livestock losses, as well as estimate the value of livestock losses and the causes of predation.
   Methods. We conducted a questionnaire survey of 147 farming households in three zones of the Toebesa subdistrict of Punakha, Bhutan. Respondents provided information on their farming activities and household income, as well as on predation losses of cattle, goats, pigs, chickens, cats and dogs caused by dholes, tigers and leopards between 2006 and 2010. Additional data on livestock populations and losses were obtained from the Renewable Natural Resources Census at the subdistrict.
   Key Results. The results showed that dholes kill more livestock than do common leopards and tigers, the two other known livestock predators in the study area. The annual average number of livestock killed by dholes was 0.19 per household, which is similar to 2% of the total household income and similar to 11% of income derived from livestock. Annual income from livestock contributes 21% to the total annual revenues of farmers in the study area. The practice of allowing cattle to freely range, unguarded, in the forest was identified as the primary factor causing high livestock losses to dholes.
   Conclusions. Dholes are the principal predator in the study area and have a significant negative impact on farmers' livelihoods through loss of income. Our findings that livestock depredation by dholes was significantly less inside the villages and on farmed plots than in the forests showed that the problem can be addressed by improved husbandry practices.
   Implications. To reduce livestock depredation by dholes, incentives or strategies should be investigated for encouraging farmers to let their livestock graze inside and around villages, which includes stall feeding and tethering, and to cooperatively shepherd them in the forests during the day.

TI  - Expected global suitability of coffee, cashew and avocado due to climate change
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Coffee, cashew and avocado are of high socio-economic importance in many tropical smallholder farming systems around the globe. As plantation crops with a long lifespan, their cultivation requires long-term planning. The evaluation of climate change impacts on their biophysical suitability is therefore essential for developing adaptation measures and selecting appropriate varieties or crops. In this study, we modelled the current and future suitability of coffee arabica, cashew and avocado on a global scale based on climatic and soil requirements of the three crops. We used climate outputs of 14 global circulation models based on three emission scenarios to model the future (2050) climate change impacts on the crops both globally and in the main producing countries. For all three crops, climatic factors, mainly long dry seasons, mean temperatures (high and low), low minimum temperatures and annual precipitation (high and low), were more restrictive for the global extent of suitable growing regions than land and soil parameters, which were primarily low soil pH, unfavourable soil texture and steep slopes. We found shifts in suitable growing regions due to climate change with both regions of future expansion and contraction for all crops investigated. Coffee proved to be most vulnerable, with negative climate impacts dominating in all main producing regions. For both cashew and avocado, areas suitable for cultivation are expected to expand globally while in most main producing countries, the areas of highest suitability may decrease. The study reveals that climate change adaptation will be necessary in most major producing regions of all three crops. At high latitudes and high altitudes, however, they may all profit from increasing minimum temperatures. The study presents the first global assessment of climate change impacts on cashew and avocado suitability.

TI  - Adoption of ICT-Based Information Sources and Market Participation among Smallholder Livestock Farmers in South Africa
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - The study explored the contribution of information and communication technology (ICT)-based information sources to market participation among smallholder livestock farmers. Use of ICTs is considered paramount for providing smallholder farmers with required market information, and also to reduce market asymmetries. A double hurdle regression was utilized to analyze data collected from 150 smallholder livestock farmers in the study area. The results show that while use of ICT-based market information sources significantly influenced market participation, the effect of using ICT-based information sources on the intensity of market participation was not significant. Other variables shown to influence both market participation and the intensity of market participation were age, additional income and membership of farmer cooperatives. This suggests the need to consider other associated factors in the application and design of interventions that utilize ICT-based information sources to achieve market engagement among smallholders.

TI  - Business models of SMEs as a mechanism for scaling climate smart technologies: The case of Punjab, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Many Climate Smart Agricultural (CSA) technologies fail to achieve their full potential impact due to low levels of adoption by smallholder farmers and difficulties in scaling CSA. This paper presents how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can act as change agents for the uptake of CSA technologies where their business models may be seen as adoption and scaling mechanisms. Drawing upon our fieldwork in Punjab (India) during which over 100 respondents have been interviewed, critical issues and enabling factors for the business model of two types of SMEs, i.e. farmer cooperatives and individual service providers of climate smart technologies have been identified. Enabling factors supporting adoption are driven by scientific and practical evidence of CSA technologies, good partnership between SMEs and research institutes, good customer relationships and effective channels through farmers' field trials. Critical issues consist of distortive government subsidies on energy and the lack of market intelligence affecting the profitability of the business model. Scaling is enhanced through market intelligence and a favouring regulatory landscape. However, difficult socio-economic circumstances and distortive government subsidies limit the role of SMEs business model as mechanism for scaling. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Patterns of Engagement for Smallholder Farmers in Accessing Government Markets in South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN BUSINESS
AB  - The South African Government's drive to empower smallholder farmers through preferentially facilitated access to procurement opportunities should be concomitantly matched with the smallholder capacity to deliver. However, there has been little information from the literature to examine the smallholder farmers' predisposition toward aggregation or whether they would prefer to remain independent from any form of organization to enhance their capacity. The study was undertaken, based on a simple random selection of the smallholder farmers in the district of Thabo Mofutsanyane. The results indicate that despite the perceived benefits of belonging to a group, about half of the smallholder farmers would prefer to remain independent from any form of aggregation or farmer group. The results are an antithesis to the common literature opinion on farmer grouping or aggregation. On the other hand, it may be that smallholder farmers would subscribe to coming together for collective benefit, but currently, do not have a formal governance structure or group account. The results provide an alert that while the government considers group operations such as cooperatives as a potential mechanism to deepen empowerment, it remains a challenge to properly entrench such notion for collective group operations beyond the means of the smallholder farmers to access resources.

TI  - Ecological and socio-cultural factors influencing plant management in Nahuatl communities of the Tehuacan Valley, Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
AB  - Background: Management types and their intensity may vary according to indicators such as: (1) practices complexity, (2) degree of techniques specialization, (3) occurrence and types of social regulations, (4) artificial selection intensity, (5) energy invested, (6) tools types, and (7) amounts of resources obtained. Management types of edible plants were characterized and analyzed in Nahuatl communities of the Tehuacan Valley. We expected that both natural and human pressures generate risk on plant resources availability, influencing human responses of management directed to decrease risk. We particularly hypothesized that magnitude of risk would be a direct function of human pressures favored by cultural and economic value and ecological factors such as scarcity (restricted distribution and abundance). Management practices may decrease risk of plant resources, more effectively when they are more intense; however, absence or insufficiency of management practices on endangered plants may favor loss of their populations. Understanding current management motives and their consequences on the purpose of ensuring availability of plant resources might allow us to understand similar processes occurring in the past. This issue is particularly important to be studied in the Tehuacan Valley, where archaeologists documented possible scenarios motivating origins of plant management by agriculture during prehistory.
   Methods: Through ethnobotanical collecting, 55 semi-structured and free listing interviews we inventoried edible plant species used in five villages of Coyomeapan, Mexico. We identified: (1) native plant species whose products are obtained exclusively through simple gathering, (2) native species involving simple gathering and other management types, and (3) non-native species managed by agricultural management. We conducted in depth studies on the 33 native species managed through gathering and other types of practices. We carried out a total of 660 sessions of detailed interviews to 20 households randomly selected. We showed to people voucher specimens and photos of the sample of species chosen and documented their cultural and economic values. Spatial availability of these plant species was evaluated through vegetation sampling. Values for each cultural, economic, and ecological indicator were codified and averaged or summed and weighed according to frequency of interviewees' responses or ecological conditions per plant species. With the standardized values of these indicators we performed a PCA and scores of the first principal component were considered as a risk index, which summarizes information of thirteen indicators of human use, demand and scarcity of each plant species. Similarly, eleven indicators of energy invested, complexity, tools and management strategies were used for performing PCA and scores of the first principal component were considered as management intensity index for each plant species. A linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the relation between risk and management intensity indexes. Amounts of variation of management data explained by ecological, cultural and economic information, as well as their risk level were analyzed through canonical correspondence analyses (CCA).
   Results: A total of 122 edible plant species were recorded, nearly 30% of them were introduced domesticated plants, 51 were wild species obtained exclusively by simple gathering and 33 were native species obtained by simple gathering and other management practices, these latter were the ones more deeply studied. People recognized variants in 21 of these latter 33 species, the variants receiving differential use, management, artificial selection and incipient domestication. The lowest values of management intensity corresponded to species under simple gathering and tolerance, mostly annual abundant plants, occasionally consumed by few people. The highest management intensity values were recorded in species with economic importance, mostly perennial with recognized variants whose management requires using tools, and which are protected by collective regulations. The regression analysis indicated significant value R-2 = 0.433 (P < 0.001) between risk and management indexes. CCA explained 65.5% of variation of management intensity, mainly by socio-cultural factors (32.6%), whereas ecological data explained 21.3% and the intersection of all factors 11.6%. Variation of management intensity is 67.6% explained by risk variables. Length-span of life cycle, reproductive system type, distribution, number of parts used, number of management and use forms and type of regulations were statistically significant.
   Conclusion: People manage plant resources according to the role these play in households' subsistence, the quantity available and the quality of their useful products; particularly important is the balance between resources availability and demand. Management responses to risk are also influenced by the ease to propagate or manipulate individual plants and time requiring the construction of manipulation strategies and techniques.

TI  - Adoption of Bio-fortified Pro-Vitamin-A Cassava and Health Outcome of Farming Households in Abia and Anambra States Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION
AB  - This study examined the relationship between the adoption of bio-fortified pro-vitamin-A cassava varieties and farming households' health outcomes using cross sectional data obtained from 318 cassava farmers in southeast Nigeria. The data was analysed using binary logistic regression, propensity score matching of treatment effects and percentages. The study found that number of children under five, household size, education of head of household, extension service, ownership of television, radio, mobile phone and tricycle, membership of cooperative societies, and access to credit were the significant predictors of adoption of pro-vitamin-A bio- fortified cassava varieties in the States. The study also found that the main constraints militating against adoption of pro-vitamin-A bio-fortified cassava include decaying of roots immediately after maturation, high cost of cassava stem, and high moisture content. The estimate of the effect of the adoption of bio-fortified pro-vitamin-A cassava varieties on incidence of vitamin-A deficiency related diseases was significant with an average treatment effect on the adopters of -0.463. The adoption of bio-fortified pro-vitamin-A cassava varieties has substantial effect on the reduction of vitamin-A deficiency related health outcomes. There is need for wider awareness and dissemination of the varieties among cassava farmers, while interventions should target the promotion of both production and consumption of such cassava varieties.

TI  - Land Allocation Choice in Both Contract and Non-Contract Farming: A Study of Potato Growers in West Bengal, India
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - This paper analyses how farmers to take decision to allocate and use their lands for potato production when both contract and non-contract farming options are available in West Bengal. We used a primary data collected from 327 potato producing households in Bankura and Bardhaman districts of West Bengal. We used generalized least squares fixed effect model in the empirical analysis. We observed that imposed restriction of seed supply limits the choice of both potato farming and non-potato farming. The benefits from contract farming are not accrued by the farmers who are mainly small and marginal landholders. They are also in a moment of ambiguity to choice their land use under non-potato cultivation. The choice of the farmers, therefore, remains constrained. This uncertainty can be overcome only through effective land use planning and institutional intervention.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis of Farmers Perception of the Constraints to Sunflower Production: A Transverse Study Approach Using Hierarchical Logistic Model (HLM)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Sunflower production is an excellent choice for both local and national agribusiness with significant potential in smallholder farming systems due to low input costs, consistent yields, and a short planting window. However, farmers are faced with interrelated constraints in their sunflower production. This study was undertaken to examines the perceptions of the constraints to sunflower production as perceived by smallholder farmers in North West Province, South Africa. The research identifies some factors related to sunflower production constraints. Then, a stratified random sampling technique was used to select 172 sunflower farmers and they were asked to rate their response on these attributes on a 5-points Likert scale. Leveraging principal component analysis (PCA), we agglomerated and condense information from the original datasets of the constraint attributes into three main components (innovation, farm finance, and crop management practice). Because of the hierarchical structure of the dataset with farmers nested within their local municipalities, we use Hierarchical Logistic Modeling techniques to identify the factors that determine farmer's perceived interest in innovation, farm finance, and crop management practices. Innovation and farm finance emerge to be critical elements for sustainable sunflower production. The findings indicate that age, education, household size, farm size, cooperative membership, and gender are strongly correlated with farmers' perceived interest in innovation and farm finance characteristics. This study recommends that to promote these elements among smallholder farmers, it is necessary for governments at the local and national level to invest in extension service and education, cooperative organizations, research, and development in disentangling the age, gender, and farm size inequalities existing in the district sunflower production.

TI  - Rearticulating caste: the global cottonseed commodity chain and the paradox of smallholder capitalism in south India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE
AB  - Cottonseed is an aspirational crop for smallholders newly incorporated in the global cottonseed commodity chain as own-account cultivators in South India. The labor to produce cottonseeds, which are hybrids, in the field is excessive. Multinational and Indian corporations depend on hybridization to protect their intellectual property rights in branded seeds. As wage rates rise and seed prices do not, the outsourcing of cottonseed production to smallholders is attractive to capital. It is mostly the unpaid, family labor of smallholders which now generates exchange value. While smallholders dream of spectacular gains and some success stories seem to support this, growing cottonseed is a risky business and, at times, the returns to smallholders are so low that the very costs of reproducing family labor are unmet; many go into debt. Yet, smallholders from a formerly untouchable caste, or Dalit, community, who just a short while ago worked as 'cottonseed children' for rich farmers are, for the first time, proudly growing cottonseed on 'their own plots of land' and 'laboring for themselves'. To explain this paradox I propose a vernacular calculus of the economic, a noneconomistic grid, for understanding why Dalit smallholders continue this form of production even when they could earn more from wage labor. I argue that the rearticulation of caste in terms of dignity and perceptions of autonomy shape this calculus. I argue further that Dalit smallholders experience the inherent contradictions of capitalism through a 'structure of feeling' marked by perplexity. At a time when smallholder contract farming is being suggested as a new development strategy by the World Bank and questioned by its detractors, a vernacular calculus of the economic and affective experiences marked by perplexity may be more widely relevant as generalized characteristics of smallholder capitalism.

TI  - Growing up in Nso: Changes and continuities in children's relational networks during the first three years of life
T2  - ETHOS
AB  - It is an undisputed fact among attachment researchers that children need stability and continuity in their caregiving environment for optimal developmental outcomes. However, anthropological studies show that informal and often temporally limited kinship-based foster care, including changes of children's primary caregivers, is widespread in some cultural contexts and considered normative and thus beneficial for children. Based on ethnographic interviews with Nso families in northwestern Cameroon, we analyzed the dynamics of caregiving arrangements and relational networks during infancy and early childhood. Exploring household compositions, caregiving responsibilities, children's preferred caregivers, and foster care arrangements revealed multiple caregiver networks, with the importance of the mother decreasing and the importance of alloparents and peers increasing as the children grow older. Also, families have fluid boundaries, with about one-third of the children changing households in the first three years of life. The Nso children's experiences reflect a relational cultural model of infant care as a cooperative task and a communal conception of attachment. The results are discussed in relation to attachment theory's claims about universal patterns of development.

TI  - Identifying trade-offs between adaptation, mitigation and development in community responses to climate and socio-economic stresses: Evidence from Zanzibar, Tanzania
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - In this paper, we examine how communities in Zanzibar cope with and adapt to multiple-stressors including climate change, and how these responses affect long-term adaptation, mitigation and development (AMD) goals. In particular, we identify the multiple-stressors that affect natural-resource dependent communities in Zanzibar. We then explore how community responses affect long-term development and mitigation goals before we examine the barriers to maximising AMD synergies in community responses. We use the DPSIR (Drivers - Pressures - States - Impacts - Response) as a tool to organise the complex information relating to both the marine and terrestrial SES in Zanzibar. Using data from household surveys and community-level focus groups, we find that responses to stressors resemble coping strategies as they provide short-term relief but in the long-term may negatively affect development goals. Furthermore, responses generate a trade-off between adaptation, mitigation and development. For example, when farmers respond to low productivity by spending longer on the farm, there is a development trade-off as time burdens are increased, and a mitigation trade-off as secondary forest cannot be established. We identify that AMD compatible responses are constrained by resource, regulatory, learning and governance barriers. We conclude that without local climate policy intervention, 'mal-adaptations', which threaten both mitigation and development goals, could occur across a range of temporal and spatial scales.

TI  - Beyond 'empty' forms of formalization: The credibility of a renewed attempt at forest titling in Southwest China
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - Whereas the prospective benefits of formalization programs are well-understood and received, less attention has been placed on the feasibility of such actions. This paper studies titling under China's Collective Forest Tenure Reform. We employ the Formal, Actual, and Targeted (FAT) Institutional Framework, based on the 'credibility thesis', to examine whether titling increases tenure credibility. To do so, we draw upon interviews and surveys collected in the Wuling Mountain Area (Southwest China), and compare formal policy objectives to households' targeted (desired) preferences and actual forest rights. Our findings show divergences between formal and targeted versus actual rights. While titles were widely issued, socially supported, and farmers deemed boundaries and plot sizes clear, there is a paradox: (i) half of forest titles did not record boundaries; (ii) boundaries were not uniformly recorded; (iii) no on-site surveying had taken place; (iv) plot data were based on replicating older data, estimates, or averages; (v) titles had not been issued in contested areas; (vi) farmers had a weak legal understanding of ownership and lease rights. We argue that due to pressure from the central government to complete titling in five years, forest registration has emerged as an 'empty institution': an institutional compromise where spatial complexities were disregarded and neglected during implementation. Although seemingly credible at present, such outcomes of formalization bear the risk that future changes could easily dampen the reform's institutional efforts and intentions.

TI  - To keep or not to keep the farmland? Incentives and barriers to farmers' decisions in urbanizing China
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Global societies are becoming increasingly urbanized, which is posing serious challenges to the efficient use of farmland. In response to this, a suite of institutional reforms in China from 1978 onwards has been released to combat the marginalizing of smallholder farming, and drive the modernization of agriculture. Nevertheless, the conventional literature sidelines the outcomes of the reforms eventually undertaken varied, and the knowledge concerning the behavior logic of farmers. This article aims to understand the contributory barriers and potential incentives that drive the adaptation of farmers to a recent farmland use right reform. Such institutional reform, that is "the withdrawal from farmland contracting management right (FCMR)", which allows farmers to terminate their FCMR at any time, and at the same time, can withdraw from their agreement on the ground of the principle of voluntariness and compensation by law. Through the questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews in two pilot areas in inland China, this article has interrogated the factors that drive or impede the farmers in selecting to discontinue holding their FCMR by employing the Probit model. We argue that firstly, notwithstanding the positive effects of farmland scale upon the withdrawal from FCMR, it is jointly inhibited by the risk aversion of smallholding farmers, the expected potential property value, and the exaggerated transaction costs. Secondly, in contrast to the traditional perception, those who have a lower reliance on agricultural pro-duction are disinclined to terminate their FCMR instead. Overall, this article articulates the determining role of the rise in property value in the conceptualization of the behavior logic of farmers in relation to the withdrawal from FCMR. Also, this article unravels that the abovementioned factors complicate the realization of central government directives on the ground.

TI  - The farmers' perceptions of ANPS pollution and its influencing factors in Poyang Lake Region, China
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Individual farmers represent the main management entities of agricultural production under the family-contract responsibility system in China, and thus play crucial roles in the prevention and control of agricultural nonpoint source (ANPS) pollution. The analysis of the farmers' perceptions of ANPS pollution as well as the factors affecting their perceptions can provide valuable information for relevant policy-making to preserve high quality water in Poyang Lake and regional quality of arable land. Through a survey titled 'Farmers' perceptions of ANPS pollution and farming behaviors in the Poyang Lake Region', the data related to the perceptions of farmers on ANPS pollution were collected. The factors that affect their awareness of ANPS pollution were identified with the method of boosted regression trees (BRT). The results indicated that the farmers had awareness of the risk of ANPS pollution to some extent, but they lacked adequate scientific knowledge. Generally, they had no consciousness about how to prevent and control ANPS pollution and did not understand techniques needed for proper scientifically sound application of fertilizers and pesticides. The main factors that influenced their perceptions of ANPS pollution are (from high to low): the ratio of total income which comes from farming, per capita farmland, age, education level, and household income. Some measures targeted to improve the prevention and control of ANPS pollution were proposed: developing modern agricultural techniques and promoting large-scale farming, increasing public campaigns related to ANPS pollution prevention and control with the goal of raising the level of awareness of farmers, and reforming the methods used to promote science and technology in agriculture and encourage the proper use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

TI  - Scaling up agriculture? The dynamics of land transfer in inland China
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Major changes are taking place in the Chinese countryside. Long a smallholder dominant economy with small and fragmented farms, a suite of policies, regulations, and financial instruments are being mobilised to drive larger-scale, more commercialised, and more industrialised farming in China. Larger operators such as "dragon-head" agribusinesses are transforming production and supply chains, while the operational rights and titles over farmland are being formalised so that smallholders can more easily transfer their land to large-scale producers. This article aims to deepen our understanding of the extent and nature of land transfer in China by exploring its dynamics in inland provinces. It draws on a 2019 survey of more than 900 cash-cropping farms in four provinces (Hebei, Shaanxi, Hubei and Yunnan), semi-structured interviews, and secondary data. Our mixed methods approach supports in-depth analysis of the extent and dynamics of land transfer in apple, tea, orange and coffee-growing areas. We find that in contrast to national statistics, land transfer from smallholders to other operators is generally quite limited, a finding which highlights the ongoing viability of specialised smallholder farming and other site-specific barriers to scaling up. In the site where land transfer is most extensive, it is being driven by a state-agribusiness-cooperative alliance rather than through a newly emerged rural land market. We also find that the nature of leasing out farmland is markedly different to leasing in farmland. Where it occurs, the leasing out of land tends to be organised and formalised, and is tied to state developmentalist goals, particularly poverty alleviation. The leasing in of land is more widespread and occurs on an informal basis. Our analysis highlights key conditions that determine uneven land transfer and confirms that local political-economic dynamics complicate the realisation of central government directives on the ground.

TI  - WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE BETWEEN CROP FARMER AND SEDENTARY PASTORALIST'S HOUSEHOLDS IN OYO AND KWARA STATES, NIGERIA
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The paper assessed willingness to pay for peaceful coexistence between crop farmer and sedentary pastoralist's households in Oyo and Kwara States, Nigeria. The broad objective of the study is to determine factors influencing the respondent households' willingness to pay for peaceful coexistence. Specifically, the study describes the economic and social benefits of peaceful coexistence to the respondents, identifies the perceived causes of conflicts in the past between the two sets of economic agents, determines the respondents' WTP for peaceful cohabitation, and analyzes the determinants of their WTP for coexistence in the study area. The analysis revealed that the respondents in the study area were more willing to pay for cattle entrustment contract and resource/product exchange than calf sharing and milk sharing as coexistence practices. The analysis further revealed that age, household size, farm size, herd size, membership of association(s) and farm income positively and significantly influenced the respondents' willingness to pay for coexistence practices. The willingness to pay for coexistence practices is an indication of peaceful cohabitation of these important economic agents in the study area. The paper employed a quantitative and a qualitative analysis using descriptive statistics comprising percentages and means in describing the socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents. Binary choice logit model was used in capturing the WTP for peaceful coexistence based on the dichotomous choice contingent valuation approach. The effect of the various socioeconomic factors on the respondents' WTP for coexistence were examined by specifying and estimating the binary choice logit regression model.

TI  - Engaging Smallholders in Flower Agribusiness for Inclusive Rural Development: The Case of Yunnan, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Serious farmland scarcities make smallholders a default mode for China's agriculture, which makes efficient and equitable rural development a great challenge. Tensions lead to alternation between autonomous family farming and coordinated collective agriculture. Rapid urbanization since the 1980s has strongly stimulated flower-growing and agribusiness in Yunnan, China. The organization for commercial flower-farming is, however, an issue. Officially promoted for collective farming, voluntary cooperatives are wrecked by the free-riding problem. Grower associations nevertheless spontaneously emerge, with the flexible entry and exit of members without binding joint-assets and joint-ownership, which is facilitated by technological changes to the transaction. Empirical investigation in Tonghai, Yunnan, unveiled the institution of agribusiness-smallholder partnership for inclusive rural development. Smallholders have actively participated in flower agriculture, which has contributed significantly to the development of rural economies. The high casualty of micro-smallholders suggests that farm size is an important and crucial factor for sustainable farming. Effective rural development has to be supported by endogenous non-agricultural jobs so that farm size can be increased.

TI  - Resilience of traditional rice-dominated agricultural communities to precipitation variability in the North China Plain
T2  - CLIMATE RESEARCH
AB  - This study used the concept of resilience as a framework to explore the response of a traditional rice-dominated agricultural society to past climatic variability in the Hai River Basin, North China Plain. In agriculture-based communities, the performance of resilience refers to the functions of cropping and water systems and the flexibility to respond to an uncertain climate. With limited water inflow, the responses to the recent historical precipitation variability in this case study demonstrated that the local people were adjusting to both interannual variability and extreme drought through their collective and individual actions. In the short term, the local people coped by adjusting the planting area and individually switching from planting paddy rice to less water-intensive crops in order to adapt to a severe, continuing drought. However, because of poor management of the water system by community leaders and the lack of an adequate budget for the collective action of rice cropping, the shift in land use to rice cropping as an adaptation to the recent increased precipitation was not usually reversible. In the long term, the agricultural production of most villages became less resilient to current precipitation variability, despite the intention of most villagers to change the current cropping system to improve their low household staple food self-sufficiency. This study indicated that over the long term the social resilience and adaptive capacity of agricultural communities and their associated stakeholders must be built on and enhanced to better cope with the constraints and opportunities of current climate variability. New institutional arrangements, including collective irrigation regimes and community leadership capabilities, are required to build social resilience and to enhance adaptive capacity for future uncertainties.

TI  - Empirical assessment of water management institutions in northern China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB  - We examine the development of irrigation management in northern China using data from village and household panels. During the past decade, reform-oriented institutions, such as water user associations and contracting, have largely replaced the traditional institution of collective management in village-level irrigation systems. A feature unique to China is that water user associations and contractors are provided with monetary incentives to save water. Water user associations have not yet achieved the broad-based participation of farmers that some advocates consider as a primary goal for forming the associations. Many village leaders serve also as the leaders of water user associations, thus possibly reducing opportunities for receiving operational input and policy direction from farmers. However, we observe improved performance of irrigation systems managed by water user associations, relative to collective management, in terms of maintenance expenditures, the timeliness of water deliveries, and the rates of fee collection. Performance has improved also in systems managed by contractors, although not as substantially as in the case of water user associations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Extended Urbanization through Capital Centralization: Contract Farming in Palm Oil-Based Agroindustrialization
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The discussion on extended urbanization considers accumulation by dispossession as a key apparatus for instilling urban logic into predominantly rural areas. This paper contends that extended urbanization can also be produced without physical dispossession of community land. This is illustrated by the case study of Sei Mangkei, an emerging palm oil agroindustrial district in North Sumatra, Indonesia. Capitalist industries prefer monetization through contract farming rather than privatization as an instrument to capture the productivity of palm oil smallholder land. The people who serve as smallholders in the palm oil industry are not victims of land appropriation. Moreover, this situation was also triggered by an opportunity for maximizing the socio-economic welfare of smallholders. However, the limited options to access other economic activities when the commodity crisis occurred was a consequence that smallholders were not aware of in the past. Thus, we assert that extended urbanization was (re)produced through the articulation of socio-economic and cultural practices of smallholders on a local-scale with regard to the dynamics of the broader process of global industrialization.

TI  - The Effect of Land Right Stability on the Application of Fertilizer Reduction Technologies-Evidence from Large-Scale Farmers in China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This article examines the impact of the stability of the management rights of transferred land (TLMR) on the adoption of technologies aiming to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers (ARFTs) based on the survey data of large-scale grain growing households in Anhui, China. Using the IV-Probit model, the present paper defines the stability of TLMR and the results estimated by IV-Probit model shows that a one-year extension of land lease period can increase the probability of using organic fertilizer and soil-testing formula fertilizer by 3.16% and 4.92%, respectively, while contract breaching in the lease period can reduce the probability of using organic fertilizer and soil-testing formula fertilizer by 46.9% and 51.38%, respectively. However, the land-lease period and land transfer contract breaching in the lease period have no significant effect on the use of farmyard manure by large-scale grain growing households. The main conclusion is that improving the stability of TLMR is conducive to prompting large-scale grain growing households to adopt ARFTs, especially the adoption of organic fertilizer and soil-testing formula fertilizer. The government should improve the stability of TLMR by standardizing the form and content associated with land transfer contracts and setting the minimum land-lease term.

TI  - Smallholders' Water Management Decisions in the Face of Water Scarcity from a Socio-Cognitive Perspective, Case Study of Viticulture in Mendoza
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Grape producers in the Province of Mendoza (Argentina) are extremely vulnerable to the current water crisis, especially smallholders who have very limited resources to adapt. The discourse on adaptation options is mainly technocratic with a focus on modern irrigation systems not accessible to the majority of grape producers. Thus, this research aims at shedding light and providing information for the design of inclusive adaptation strategies by identifying, with a socio-cognitive model, feasible adaptation options according to grape producers' perceptions and the related implementation barriers. Grape producers' water scarcity and adaptation appraisal were explored through qualitative interviews in the Northern Oasis (Mendoza) to better understand how producers' intentions are shaped through perceptual and socio-cognitive processes. To do so, a socio-cognitive model on grape producers' adaptation to water scarcity (GPAWS) was developed based on two similar models. The analysis reveals that, as overall grape producers share a similar concern with the risk of water scarcity, their different adaptive behaviours tend to be mostly derived from their differences in adaptation appraisal. Moreover, producers' adaptation intentions are mainly reactive and limited to answer short term, immediate risks. Most of the grape producers perceive feasibility and plan the implementation of reasonable efficiency measures. However, multiple barriers consequently limit the implementation of such adaptation options perceived as feasible by the producers. The results of this research can support government actors, agriculture research institutes, but also the cooperatives of producers seeking to encourage farmers' adaptation, by identifying which adaptation options could be implemented according to the type of producers and their adaptation appraisal, but also why certain feasible measures are not being implemented.

TI  - Going to scale-From community-based to population-wide genetic improvement and commercialized sheep meat supply in Ethiopia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB  - Community-based breeding programs (CBBPs) have shown, at pilot scale, to be effective and beneficial in achieving genetic progress and in improving livelihoods of smallholder communities. In Ethiopia 134 sheep and goat CBBPs were operational producing their own improved rams and bucks. Based on experience the implementation of further programs is possible with appropriate private and public support. A different challenge is the efficient dissemination of the improved genetics produced in current CBBPs to create population-wide economic impact. We present a framework applied to the Ethiopian Washera sheep breed to meet this challenge. We propose the establishment of a genetic improvement structure that supports a meat commercialization model based on the integration of community-based breeding program cooperatives, client communities and complementary services such as fattening enterprises. We calculated that the recently established 28 community-based breeding programs in the Washera breeding tract can provide genetically improved rams to 22% of the four million head. To reach the whole population 152 additional CBBPs are needed. We simulated the genetic improvements obtainable in the current 28 CBBPs assuming realized genetic progress in CBBPs of a similar breed and calculated the expected additional lamb carcass meat production after 10 years of selection to be 7 tons and the accumulated discounted benefit 327 thousand USD. These benefits could be increased if the CBBPs are linked to client communities by providing them with improved rams: additional meat production would be 138 tons with a value of 3,088 thousand USD. The total meat production of the existing Washera CBBPs was calculated at 152 tons and the joint meat production of CBBPs if integrated with client communities would be 3,495 tons. A full integration model, which includes enterprises purchasing lambs for fattening, can produce up to 4,255 tons of meat. We conclude that Washera CBBPs cooperatives can benefit from a higher level of organization to produce population-wide genetic improvement and economic benefits. Unlike in the dairy and chicken industries, for low input sheep and goat smallholder systems the proposed commercialization model puts breeder cooperatives at the center of the operation. Cooperatives need to be capacitated and supported to become fully functional business ventures.

TI  - Improving Hill Farming: From Maize Monocropping to Alternative Cropping Systems in the Thai Highlands
T2  - LAND
AB  - Lately, the Hill Pond Rice System (HPRS) is being promoted as a form of alternative farming systems in selected northern provinces of Thailand, in which the land conversion is designed to maximize rainwater harvesting in farmland consisting of forest trees, water reservoirs, paddy fields, and high-value crop cultivation to serve environmental and livelihood needs. This study employed the double-hurdle model and the tobit technique to investigate the farm-level factors associated with land conversion from maize monocropping to the HPRS using primary data collected from 253 households in Nan, Chiang Mai, Tak, and Lampang Provinces. It was found that education, farming knowledge, understanding benefits of the HPRS, access to water sources, access to advis, and workforce sharing raised the likelihood and extent of farmland conversion into the HPRS. In contrast, perceived complexity of the HPRS, experiences with negative shocks, and land tenure security lowered the likelihood and extent of land conversion. The findings suggest that on-farm collective action should be promoted to mitigate labor constraints in implementation and that access to equipment should be enhanced through HPRS advisors' visits.

TI  - An Empirical Examination of Sustainability of Women's Empowerment Using Panel Data from India
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - In this article, we empirically test the sustainability of women's empowerment using representative and rich individual-level panel data from India for the years 2004-5 and 2011-12. Sustainability is defined in terms of durability (whether empowerment is carried forward or continues in the long run) and diffusion (whether empowerment has positive spillover effects). A domain-based framework is used to capture the multidimensional nature of empowerment. In terms of durability, we find that the majority of the women remained empowered over time. The baseline characteristics that determine empowerment durability are (1) individual capabilities such as age, education, and wage work, (2) asset endowment, and (3) opportunity structure such as access to water, electricity, and owning a toilet. Additionally, we find that a change in collective assets over time is positively and significantly correlated with empowerment durability. Finally, we observe that empowerment has a significant diffusion effect from empowered women to other women in the same household as well as to women who do not co-reside but share family ties. These findings imply that empowerment is dynamic and the social benefit of empowering women appears considerably higher than what has been previously estimated when its long-term effects are considered.

TI  - The reform of collective forest rights in China and Its implementation in the Fushun City Region
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - The paper provides an historical overview of the gradual but erratic evolution of collective forest rights in the People's Republic of China. Forest tenure rights have been subject to numerous changes since the establishment of People's Republic in 1949. In the most recent decades, use rights for forests have been transferred from collective to individual household-based with the intent to provide benefits to forest farmers. The implementation of the intended reforms has varied considerably from one province to another, with the majority of reform efforts originating in the southern provinces. This article looks at the major effort undertaken in Northeast China. The Fushun collective forest rights reform was analyzed using data obtained through field investigation by the Fushun Forestry Bureau. Initial effects of reform in terms of modes of rights assignment and farmer motivations to conduct forest management activities, as well as farmers' income and financing conditions, are discussed. Remaining significant challenges are also briefly considered.

TI  - Crop rotation model for contract farming with constraints on similar profits
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - In China, investors have contracts with smallholder farmers to plant organic vegetable crops. The objective of the smallholder farmers is to maximize profits per unit of farm area, and minimize the differences in profits between farmers. Farmers' profits are a function of the crop rotation scheduling and the achieved prices. Here we propose an operational model that considers a crop rotation scheduling for an investor that offers contracts to many smallholder farmers. A heuristic algorithm was designed to identify the optimal rotation scheduling that would achieve both objectives of maximizing prices and minimizing the profit differences between smallholder farmers. Real data from a Chinese company was used to parameterize the model. Model results indicate that significant improvements in profits and farmers equality could be obtained if an optimal crop rotation scheduling would be used. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Farmers' Willingness to Pay for Services to Ensure Sustainable Agricultural Income in the GAP-Harran Plain, Sanliurfa, Turkey
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Sustainable agriculture is necessary for farmers to have a sustainable income. This research aims to determine the willingness to pay (WTP) of farmers in the GAP-Harran Plain for services that would ensure sustainable agricultural income, the factors affecting their willingness, and the minimum amount they would be willing to pay. The main material of the research has been obtained by means of face-to-face surveys involving farmers selected by a simple random sampling method in the GAP-Harran Plain. The sampling volume was determined with a 95% confidence limit and a 5% error margin. Heckman's two-stage model was used for the analysis. According to the results of the research, 22.61% of the participants showed WTP, and the average amount they were willing to pay was 180.82 TL/hectare (ha) ($31.86/ha). This amount was 3.08% of the average annual agricultural income calculated. About 41.22% of the participants showed no WTP. They believed that the public sector is accountable of the services and consequently, they should be provided free of charge. About 23.14% of the participants showed WTP only for the services that they needed. The average WTP for all participants was calculated as 40.9 TL/ha ($7.21/ha) and 1.2 million $/year for the GAP-Harran Plain. This amount is the minimum and may increase by several folds with a demand-based variety of service delivery. The factors that statistically effect WTP have been determined as age, education, experience, number of households working in agriculture, amount of land, agricultural income, non-agricultural income, membership status of agricultural cooperatives, and product pattern. The results provide useful information to guide researchers, decision-makers, and policy-makers.

TI  - Farmer preferences in contracting with modern retail in Indonesia: A choice experiment
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - Understanding the preferences of smallholder farmers for contracting can help in making contracts more sustainable. This paper presents the results of a choice experiment (CE) among smallholder farmers in Indonesia to assess their preferences for accepting contracts with modern retail. The CE was based on attributes of actual sales transactions in modern retail and traditional retail channels. A total of 301 vegetable smallholder farmers participated, consisting of 173 farmers participating in traditional markets and 128 in modern retail markets. A random parameter logit model estimates that, in general, smallholders do not prefer contracting with modern retail over spot market selling in traditional retail channels. Most contract attributes are perceived as negative by smallholders. A willingness-to-accept analysis shows that farmers are critical of most contract attributes, particularly those related to quality requirements. Producer organizations (POs) reduce transaction costs and increase smallholders' preference toward contracts. Contract designs that reduce transaction cost, mitigate risks for farmers, provide fair prices, and involve POs are more likely to attract smallholders to modern retail channels.

TI  - Explaining variation in the economic value of irrigation water using psychological capital: a case study from Ndumo B and Makhathini, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - WATER SA
AB  - This study investigates the economic value of irrigation water using data collected from 200 smallholder producers in Makhathini and Ndumo areas, KwaZulu-Natal.The study accounts for psychological capital (individual mind-set and attitude affecting motivation to take initiatives) as an important aspect of farm management. This concept focuses more on the `soft' aspects of farm management, which have not been adequately studied in the context of smallholder farming. A sustainable livelihoods framework is employed as a conceptual framework and the role of psychological capital is integrated to explain the variation in water values. The study employs the residual valuation method to estimate water values, principal component analysis to generate an index for psychological capital, and the general linear model to explain variation in water values. The findings suggest that variation in water values was mainly influenced by the location of the farmer, farmer type, physical capital, social capital, land size, farming experience, crop type and psychological capital. The results reinforce the importance of institutional arrangements and collective bargaining as an important element of managing a smallholder farm to increase the economic value of water. To build and develop positive psychological capital for smallholders, it is recommended that government should re-visit the usual model of 'hand-outs' (input, finance). It is time to re-consider direct farmer support that entails being heavily involved in their day-to-day activities (i.e., purchasing inputs and running the irrigation schemes on their behalf). Going forward, the focus should rather be on enabling them to change their behaviour to be self-reliant and own their own destiny through on-farm and off-farm economic activities. Moreover, government and other development partners have to understand the long-term behavioural impact (on farmers) of what they do, for instance, entrenching expectations.

TI  - Building ecological resistance: Late intermediate period farming in the south-central highland Andes (CE 1100-1450)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY
AB  - In southern Peru near Lake Titicaca, at the Colla hillfort town of Ayawiri, archaeological data indicate that the construction of a large terrace complex and the production of agricultural staples were managed in a decentralized manner. The layout and engineering qualities of the terraces surrounding Ayawiri reveal that the construction, maintenance, and cultivation of these systems was managed through household labor rather than a central political authority. This agrarian landscape and labor regime provided households with what I term ecological resistance human modifications to ecosystems that provide individuals with the capacity to resist the establishment of hierarchical authority and subjugation by imperial powers. The built agricultural landscape and accompanying agrarian labor regimes made the Colla difficult to subjugate by neighboring enemies and in the 15th century, when Inka forces attempted to conquer and incorporate the Colla into their empire. The Colla were only successfully integrated into the Inka Empire after the Inka employed their own ecological tactics. This case study provides key insights into the ways that humans modify their environment to build and perpetuate ecological resistance.

TI  - Troubling notions of farmer choice: hybrid Bt cotton seed production in western India
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - The debate over agricultural biotechnology is increasingly being centered on the question of farmer choice. Advocates for biotechnology argue that farmers should be able to choose the seeds and technologies they use, and therefore these new technologies should be legalized and made available immediately. Who would deny farmers of the global South their right to choose? But these discourses of choice and freedom are being deployed to market a particular kind of development. This neoliberal development of agriculture is leading to the individualization of risk, the shifting of risk to marginalized contract farming households, and greater control for wealthier farmers, seed companies and agents. The state of Gujarat, India, is seen as a success story of hybrid Bt cotton, in which farmers have their choice of hundreds of varieties of seeds. As cotton seed production is taking off in the neighboring state of Rajasthan, however, choosing Bt cotton has different implications and meanings altogether. Drawing on eight months of qualitative research with adivasi households in Dungarpur District, Rajasthan, I offer narrative accounts from farmers and seed agents that both explore and trouble neoliberal notions of farmer choice. The use of these discourses by biotech advocates is just one example of the ways that choice and freedom are being utilized to further neoliberal development.

TI  - Estimating Technical Efficiency and Production Risk under Contract Farming: A Bayesian Estimation and Stochastic Dominance Methodology
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We investigate production risk, technical efficiency and risk attitudes amongst contract and independent farmers. We use a Bayesian parametric approach and stochastic dominance quantile regression methods to compare technical efficiency and risk attitude of smallholders in Nepal. Using farm-level data, we find that contract farmers appear to show lower inefficiency and lower production risk. Additionally, contract and independent farmers can increase output by reducing the scale of operation. Regardless of the commodity produced and farming arrangement (contract or independent production), we find that labour, land and other inputs are risk-augmenting, while the role of capital is mixed. We find a second order stochastic dominance (SSD) for lentils, and first order stochastic dominance (FSD) for tomatoes, ginger and HYV paddy seed commodities. Finally, contract farmers are more risk averse than independent farmers, regardless of the commodity produced.

TI  - Knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) relating to brucellosis in smallholder dairy farmers in two provinces in Pakistan
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The present study aimed to assess the extent of knowledge and understanding of brucellosis in smallholder dairy farmers and identify practices at the farm and household level that might pose a risk for humans contracting brucellosis. Between February and June 2015 a cross-sectional study was conducted among smallholder farms (n = 420) in five districts of Punjab and two districts of Sindh province. Farmers were interviewed using a questionnaire to obtain information on farmers' knowledge about brucellosis and the potential risks for contracting the disease that are present for dairy farmers and their families. Logistic regression and ordinal logistic models were used to investigate potential predictors for risky behaviours. The results show almost all farmers (97%) were not aware of the modes of transmission of brucellosis. Relating to risk, the majority (66%) of the farmers' families were reported to consume raw milk and its products, live in shared housing with animals (49%) and not cover hand cuts during contact with animals (74%). All farmers performed at least one risky practice on a regular basis for brucellosis transmission from animal to human. A multivariable analysis highlighted that the respondents with no formal education and those who had not heard of the disease displayed greater risky behaviour. Poor understanding of the disease, presence of multiple risky practices on farm and at the household, and incorrect perception supports the need for an educational awareness program in order to ensure uptake of improved practices.

TI  - Incentives and moral hazard: plot level productivity of factory-operated and outgrower-operated sugarcane production in Ethiopia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We investigate the unique contractual arrangement between a large Ethiopian sugar factory and its adjacent outgrower associations. The only significant difference between the sugarcane production on the factory-operated sugarcane plantation and on the outgrower-operated plots is the remuneration system and thus, the incentives to the workers. We compare the productivity of these two production schemes using a cross-sectional plot-level data set. As sugarcane production depends on various exogenous factors that are measured as categorical variables (e.g., soil type, cane variety, etc.), we estimate the production function by a nonparametric kernel regression method that takes into account both continuous and categorical explanatory variables without assuming a functional form and without imposing restrictions on interactions between the explanatory variables. Our results show that outgrower-operated plots haveceteris paribusa statistically and economically significantly higher productivity than factory-operated plots, which can be explained by outgrowers having stronger incentives to put more effort into their work than the employees of the sugar factory.

TI  - Innovating social connectedness for agricultural innovations in eastern Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - Agricultural innovations can be triggered by the social networks in which farmers have purposefully organized to support themselves. This paper, therefore, explores the values of social connectedness within locally established societies' mutual support associations for agricultural innovations. This study explains how mutual support social network associations trigger agricultural innovations and the way farmers utilize such networks to spiral agricultural innovations. Indigenous mutual support associations like Guuza, Iqubi and Afoosha function in trust-based self-enforcing orders, social networks and relationships in a more flexible and reciprocity-based order. These informal social networks are employed by farmers to collaborate on society's mutual support practices. Trust, norms and group membership are the key components of social capital within indigenous mutual support associations. The social connectedness within the sort of labor-sharing arrangement, informal financial group, funeral association and inter-village link aids member's collective capacity to figure the development of agricultural innovations. Inherently embedded social networks, mutual support, information sharing, interaction and trust among the members within mutual support associations are the values for the event of agricultural innovations. Therefore, this study concludes that stakeholders within extension systems should support and strengthen the locally established society's associations to broaden agricultural innovations. In general, this study recommends the necessity to integrate the applications of society's mutual support associations for the development of agricultural innovations.

TI  - Microenvironment identification and the feed availability for dairy cows during dry and wet seasons in the main dairy areas of Yogyakarta - Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR AND BIOMETEOROLOGY
AB  - In tropical Indonesia, which has specific dry and wet seasons, it is difficult to provide high-quality forage in sufficient quantities throughout the year. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the availability and nutrient contents of forages and other natural feed resources during the dry and wet seasons in order to provide sufficient nutrients throughout the year, as an improvement effort the productivity of dairy cows. The method used was surveys conducted at dairy smallholder and groups selected in one of the areas of dairy cooperative in Yogyakarta; and observed environment condition (temperature and humidity). Feed samples were taken and analyzed in the Laboratory of Dairy Science and Milk Industry, Faculty of Animal Science UGM. Supplies of forages, agricultural by-products, feedstuffs, and commercial concentrates were available throughout the year, although the amounts were limited. Most of dairy smallholders had greater access to forages and agricultural by-products during wet season than during the dry season; this resulted directly in a better productivity of dairy cows during the wet season. In both seasons, farmers purchased commercial concentrates from other areas to support the cows feed requirements. Smallholder dairy farmers in the dairy areas of Yogyakarta had better access to forages and agricultural by-products during the wet season than during the dry season, but need to supplement their animals with commercial concentrates obtained from outside areas during both seasons. Assuring the continuity and availability of forages and concentrate in this area is of dire importance to reduce the dependency of feed from outside of the region.

TI  - Women in the wake: expanding the legacy of Chico Mendes in Brazil's environmental movement
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
AB  - Since the death of Chico Mendes three decades ago, nearly half of the Amazon forest area has been conserved through the collective sacrifice and struggle of thousands of forest-reliant families in Brazil, twined with political will and dense scientific and technical capacity. The key position that once marginalized, rural women have played in this struggle, however, is often obscured. This paper describes the role of women, some eminent and others lesser known, in the conservation movement inspired by Chico Mendes in Brazil. Thirty years ago, women were not permitted to be union members; today, 40% of the National Council of Extractivist Populations (CNS) leadership is female, and 25% of conservation units are led by women. Brazilian women occupy positions across the full spectrum of politics from grassroots to crucial positions in government, unions and civil society organizations. As women have gained power, they have also become targets. Of the 818 assassinations recorded by the Comissito Pastoral da Terra" (CPT) between 1997 and 2017, 7% have been women. Their deaths have not been forgotten. During 2017's March of the Margaridas, in support of women's rights and in remembrance of those who have died for the cause, an estimated one hundred thousand women have participated. Since Mendes' death, the movement to conserve forests and secure land for smallholders in Brazil has not abated, but grown and evolved through cross-sectoral collaborations, intergenerational exchange, strategic advocacy across vast geographic areas, and shared bonds born of struggle. The paper highlights the vital role of women in expanding and concretizing a globally significant forest conservation movement sparked by a man with a vision.

TI  - Grapes of Wrath: Twisting Arms to Get Villagers to Cooperate with Agribusiness in China
T2  - CHINA JOURNAL
AB  - In recent years the Chinese Communist Party has moved to scale up, modernize, and commercialize agriculture by placing it under the direction of large commercial enterprises known as dragonheads. Although scholars have drawn attention to the rapid advance of capitalist-style farming in China, there has been little investigation into how villagers have been pressed to cooperate with this endeavor. In this article, we examine methods used by local officials to create a grape production base for a large wine company in Xinjiang, which entailed getting all the peasant households in several townshipsmany of which were strongly opposedto shift from cultivating rice and raising fish to growing grapes on contract. In this aggressive campaign, Party cadres and influential citizens were mobilized to persuade and coerce villagers, using an array of incentives and disincentives, to join what ultimately proved to be a very risky venture.

TI  - Presidential Address African Agricultural Development: Lessons and Challenges
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper reviews what has been learned from experiences of African agriculture and hence what policy lessons may be. Views of African agriculture over the last 130 years have changed from optimism to pessimism and at least halfway back again as the performance of the sector has fluctuated. Fortunately it seems the deep pessimism about agricultural prospects expressed in the 1980s and 1990s has receded. The performance of African agriculture since 1990 suggests that neither those who doubt that any significant advances are taking place, nor those who see advances in some remarkable but perhaps isolated cases of rapid transformation of farming and agricultural supply chains, have sufficient evidence - either from national data or small-scale studies - to support their positions. Hence policy has to rely largely on general principles and historic lessons, rather than more clearly proven propositions. Policy debates over African agricultural development may sharply divide on some topics, but there is little debate over the importance of basic conditions for agricultural development of an enabling investment climate and the provision of rural public goods. Beyond these basics, the challenge is to remedy the failings of markets that deny most smallholders access to inputs, financial services and insurance. Here opinion divides between whether to return to public provision, as with fertiliser subsidies, or whether private and collective institutional innovations will be sufficient. Recent initiatives to test and scale up the latter look promising, but most have yet to be evaluated. If agricultural development is first and foremost about establishing the basic conditions for growth, then most countries in Africa may be better placed than they have been in the past. Given the many examples that show African smallholders investing and innovating when they have the chance, then there are reasons to hope that the modest growth of production and productivity seen in the last two decades may accelerate in the future - thereby allowing African countries to make the transition from agrarian to urban economies.

TI  - Influencing Factors on the Ecological Protection Behaviors of Entrepreneurial Farmers in Chinese Forest Zones
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Following the collective forest tenure reforms in China, many households pursued entrepreneurial activities creating substantial pressure on the environment. This study examines data collected from 462 informants in 10 provinces in Southern China to understand how changes in attitudes toward ecological protection behavior occur. The internal mechanisms of ecological attitudes were explored using structural equation modeling to obtain a function path. Ecological emotion has a direct effect on ecological protection behavior by acting as an intermediary between ecological knowledge and ecological protection. Perceived ecological severity mediates between ecological knowledge and emotion influencing entrepreneurial farmers' ecological protection behavior. The perception of individual effect is mediated by perceptions of ecological severity and ecological emotion, eventually affecting ecological protection behavior. A model of cognition-emotion-practice is proposed based on the findings.

TI  - The Impact of Payments for Environmental Services on Communal Lands: An Analysis of the Factors Driving Household Land-Use Behavior in Ecuador
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This article examines how Payments for Environmental Services (PES) influence household land-use behavior in the context of common-property lands. PES programs have been increasingly applied to communities who collectively manage their lands. While a number of authors have expressed concerns about the ability of said programs to generate additional environmental benefits and the potential for PES to counter community resource management arrangements, few empirical studies have explicitly examined PES in the context of communal resource management. Here, we take advantage of the gradual rollout of an Ecuadorian PES program to compare land-use behavior on collective lands in participant communities to households in communities that are waiting to participate. The goals of the analysis are to (a) identify if the PES program has produced changes in land-use, (b) assess the degree to which household characteristics and communal governance conditions drive land-use behavior, and (c) explore the interplay between PES and communal resource management institutions. Data were gathered from a cross-sectional survey of 399 households located in 11 communities. We use difference-in-differences to estimate the average effect of PES program participation on household behavior. Logit models, coupled with qualitative analysis, unpack how communal governance characteristics influence land-use behavior and the interplay between communal governance conditions and PES. We find that PES reduced the number of households grazing livestock on collective lands by 12%, however, household and communal governance factors are also instrumental in determining land-use decisions. Our results provide empirical insights into the debate over PES in collective resource management and illustrate how PES and communal resource management institutions can build upon each other to attain desired household conservation behavior.

TI  - Impacts of Policy-Driven Transformation in the Livelihoods of Fishermen on Agricultural Landscape Patterns: A Case Study of a Fishing Village, Island of Poyang Lake
T2  - LAND
AB  - The agricultural landscape patterns of fishing village have undergone visible transformations in recent decades. Scholars pay less attention to fishermen with diverse livelihoods. Therefore, it is necessary to sort out the changing characteristics of fishermen' livelihoods and agricultural landscape patterns under different policy periods. We use in-depth interviews, remote sensing technology, and mathematical analysis to systematically study the changes in fishermen's livelihoods and in agricultural landscape patterns in a typical fishing village. The results show that policy have profoundly affected fishermen' livelihoods. Livelihood transformation have altered local land use practices, which had a direct impact on agricultural landscape patterns. The livelihood of fishermen has changed from diverse to single, and their cropping structure were gradually becoming simpler and more specialised. After grazing ban and comprehensive fishing ban, many fishermen migrated to towns and cities, it accelerated the loss of population in the fishing village, which caused the amount of abandoned land increasingly. Left-behind fishermen became rice farmers by contracting abandoned paddy fields. The expanses of abandoned land and bamboo woodland had increased, which caused agricultural landscape patterns gradually becoming fragmented, heterogeneous and complex.

TI  - Vegetable production under COVID-19 pandemic in China: An analysis based on the data of 526 households
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic had an enormous impact on the vegetable supply chain in China. Effective evaluation of the pandemic's influences on vegetable production is vital for policy settings to enhance the security of vegetable supply. Based on first-hand data from 526 households, we explored regional differences in different types of loss and potential factors affecting the severity farmer households suffered during the pandemic. The results underline that sales contraction and price volatility in the context of interruption of supply chain dominate the total losses during the pandemic. Such losses differ across provinces and are more substantial in provinces with stricter confinement measures. Farmer households' participation in local market and modern marketing methods helps mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 shock, while labor hiring and facilities adoption in production widen the losses due to the shortage in the workforce. In the future, the vegetable industry practitioners and relevant government departments should work together to coordinate the development of short and long supply chains and strengthen the stability and security of the vegetable supply chain.

TI  - Social Network, Sense of Responsibility, and Resident Participation in China's Rural Environmental Governance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Based on a survey of 2343 rural residents in China, this paper adopts a binary logistic regression model as the analytical tool to study the impact of rural residents' social network and sense of responsibility regarding their participation in environmental governance. The results show that the cost, frequency and scope of social network activities have positive and significant influences on resident participation in rural environmental governance. The cost of a social network is conducive to building a rural social network, enhancing the connection of interests and promoting the formation of a rural community. Extending social network objectives from family members to villagers can improve the cultural identity and emotional identity of rural residents. The increase in the frequency of social network activities can not only enhance trust among residents, but also reduce the cost of environmental governance mobilization. The scope of a social network acts as an inhibitor whereby social interaction beyond the scope of rural areas will reduce identification with rural emotions. The four dimensions, including responsibility cognition, responsibility will, responsibility emotion and responsibility behavior have significant influences on resident participation in rural environmental governance. Residents' sense of responsibility plays the role of an introverted driving force for them to take part in rural environmental governance, which itself helps to overcome "non-participation" behaviors of "rational smallholders" to a certain extent. Furthermore, it endows rural environmental governance with resilience. So, it is of significance to enhance rural residents' social networks and to improve rural residents' cognition of collective responsibility.

TI  - Social gains for artisanal agroindustrial producers induced by cooperation and collaboration in agri-food supply chain
T2  - SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose This study aims to analyze which collective actions (cooperation, coordination and collaboration), present in the supply chain of artisanal products, generate positive effects in terms of social gains. Design/methodology/approach The authors conduct multiple case studies in the supply chain of seven artisanal agroindustries in the Distrito Federal, Brazil. The data were collected through interviews, documental analysis and direct observation. The data were analyzed using the content analysis technique proposed by Bardin (1977). With priori and a posteriori analytical categories, it was possible to conduct: a detailed analysis of the current situation of artisanal agroindustries regarding collective actions from the perspective of supplier/supplier and supplier/client and a detailed analysis for the possible effects of collective actions that impact the supply chain and the indicators of social sustainability of artisanal agroindustries. Findings The results indicate that cooperation and collaboration have contributed positively in the transactions of the products of the artisanal agroindustries, reflecting in social gains for the producing families. In this context, some collective actions can be highlighted as follows: the collective commercial spaces, the demonstration spaces of the artisan products in the clients' environment, the prospecting of improvements from the final consumers, the face-to-face meetings with the suppliers, the product dissemination by the customer, the joint marketing actions and the rationalization of transportation logistics. Research limitations/implications The study used a qualitative approach and findings and discussion are inherently interpretative and cannot be generalized. Practical implications This study can contribute to researchers and practitioners interested in collective actions contributing to the incrementation of social responsibility in agri-food supply chains. Social implications Understanding how the collective actions support the inclusion of smallholding and artisanal producers in agri-food supply chains can help policymakers and managers to implement initiatives related to social responsibility, which can be measured using social indicators. This creates a social benefit through rural growth and economic development, generation of income and social productive inclusion of the artisanal producers in larger agri-food supply chains. Originality/value For the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper approaching collective actions as the main source of incrementation of social benefits, which can measure the incrementation of social responsibility in agri-food supply chains.

TI  - PROBABILITY OF ADOPTION OF FOOD SAFETY IN THE PRODUCTION OF ORGANIC FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN MEXICO
T2  - AGRICULTURA SOCIEDAD Y DESARROLLO
AB  - The production of organic fruits and vegetables in Mexico has been successfully positioned in the international market. Most of its adherents are small-scale producers that are organized and directed towards production for exports. It is increasingly more complex to remain in this type of markets, since it is essential to guarantee the quality and food safety of the organic fruits and vegetables offered. Organic products have caused epidemiological outbreaks of diseases, which place at risk the health of consumers and the acceptance of these products in the market. Therefore, the characteristics and circumstances that lead to the adoption of standards of food safety must be identified. This study is carried out because most small-scale producers of organic fruits and vegetables in Mexico do not implement food safety standards. The probability of adoption of these standards by small-scale producers is determined with a probit analysis. The study was developed in eight states, among them Puebla, Jalisco and Veracruz, where 22 municipalities were visited, 56 producers of organic fruits and vegetables were interviewed, from which the institutional and production variables that represent the possibility of adopting food safety were determined. The model indicates that the probability of adoption of the standards depends not only on complying with the actions established by them, but also on commercial issues and of commitment with institutions and commercial contracts made by producers.

T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - We examine changing production relations in the Mexican tequila industry to explore the ways in which large industrial firms are using "reverse leasing arrangements," a form of contract farming, to extend their control over small agave farmers. Under these arrangements, smallholders rent their parcels to contracting companies who bring in capital, machinery, labor, and other agricultural inputs. Smallholders do not have access to their land, nor do they make any of the management decisions. We analyze the factors that have led some producers to participate in reverse leasing arrangements, while allowing other producers to continue farming independently. In addition, we look at the ways in which farmers are responding to these new production relations and constraints and the strategies that they are using to regain control over the production process.

TI  - The effect of mating system and herd size on reproductive performance of dairy cows in market oriented urban dairy farms in and around Addis Ababa
T2  - REVUE DE MEDECINE VETERINAIRE
AB  - A retrospective data analysis and a cross sectional survey was conducted to study the effect of mating system and herd size, on reproductive performances of cows in smallholder market oriented urban dairy farms in Addis Ababa milk shed. Thirty three dairy farms comprising 232 cows were visited and data on reproductive performance, cow attributes, type of mating, body condition score and general farm management practices were collected. The mean (+/- SD) age at first service (AFS), age at first calving (AFC), service per conception (NSC), calving to conception interval (CCI), and duration after last calving (DALC) were 23.1 +/- 6.4 months, 33.2 +/- 6.7 months, 2.0 +/- 1.2, 176.8 +/- 79.0 days, and 172.2 +/- 159.3 days, respectively. Both AFS and AFC were significantly different (P<0.05) between farms and mating systems. There was a significant difference (P<0.05) in the NSC between farms and between the mating systems (P<0.001). The first service conception rate for pregnant cows (n=77) was 45.5% for all farms, 60.0% for AI (Artificial Insemination) farms, and 40.0% for NS (Natural service) farms with significant difference (P<0.05) between mating methods. DALC was significantly longer (P<0.05) in small farms. Effect of mating system-herd size interaction was not significant on all performance parameters. The prevalence of reproductive health problem was 27.2% and the major reproductive health problems were retained fetal membrane (33.3%) and abortion (22.3%). In conclusion, the present study showed that both the herd size and the method of mating were important risk factors that affect the reproductive performance. To minimize the cost of bull keeping in small farms and mitigate the poor AI delivery system prevailing in Ethiopia, establishing a bull service station for collective use should be considered.

TI  - FAIR TRADE AND EMPOWERMENT OF SMALL-SCALE COFFEE PRODUCERS IN CENTRAL VERACRUZ
T2  - AGRICULTURA SOCIEDAD Y DESARROLLO
AB  - Mexico is one of the main exporters of coffee (Coffea arabica L.). However, small-scale coffee producers have not received the economic benefits of the crop since several decades ago, due in large part to the huge difference present between what the final consumer pays and the price that producers obtain for their harvest. In this context, the Fair Trade certification represents an opportunity for small-scale producers to attain a better price for their coffee and to foster local development, given that there is a positive expectation about the relation between Fair Trade and empowerment. Nevertheless, there are few studies that have examined this relation specifically, which is why this study analyzes the impact of Fair Trade on individual empowerment of members from two coffee producing cooperatives in central Veracruz, in order to understand the possibilities and limitations of this certification on the promotion of local development. The methodology had a mixed approach; interviews were applied to the two presidents of the associations studied, and a survey was applied to producers. It is concluded that Fair Trade can be considered an external resource that will be successful in the promotion of empowerment if general knowledge of producers about the market and about the scheme itself increases, and if the latter allows inclusion and participation of the majority of partners.

TI  - Unravelling the role of innovation platforms in supporting co-evolution of innovation: Contributions and tensions in a smallholder dairy development programme
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - The agricultural innovation systems approach emphasizes the collective nature of innovation and stresses that innovation is a co-evolutionary process, resulting from alignment of technical, social, institutional and organizational dimensions. These insights are increasingly informing interventions that focus on setting up multi-stakeholder initiatives, such as innovation platforms and networks, as mechanisms for enhancing agricultural innovation, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. There has been much emphasis on how such platforms are organized, but only limited analysis unravelling how they shape co-evolution of innovation processes. This paper addresses this gap and conceptualizes platforms as intermediaries that connect the different actors in innovation systems in order to foster effective co-evolution. We present a case study of a smallholder dairy development programme in Kenya, led by a consortium of five organizations that provide a platform for building multi-actor partnerships to enhance smallholder dairy productivity and improve livelihoods. The findings indicate that co-evolution of innovation is a highly dynamic process with various interactional tensions and unexpected effects, and that the distributed nature of intermediation is important in resolving some of these tensions emerging at different actor interfaces. However, platforms are not always able to adapt adequately to emerging issues. This points to the need to look at platforms dynamically and pay more attention to mechanisms that strengthen feedback, learning and adaptive management in innovation processes.

TI  - An epidemiological investigation on occurrence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli in raw milk
T2  - VETERINARY WORLD
AB  - Aim: The aim of the present investigation was to study the epidemiology of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) in raw milk and molecular characterization of isolates using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
   Materials and Methods: A total of 125 raw milk samples were subjected to isolation, identification, and confirmation of virulence-associated genes by multiplex PCR (mPCR). The samples were collected from a milk cooperative society of Thrissur district, Kerala. For further epidemiological investigation, samples such as dung (126), hair coat of cow (60), udder swab (60), udder wash (60), milking utensil wash (36), Milker's hand wash (36), water (36), soil (36), and feed (36) were collected from the households from which the raw milk tested positive for EHEC.
   Results: The occurrence of EHEC in individual raw milk samples was found to be 8.8%. The major source of contamination to raw milk was found to be dung (19.84%) followed by udder swab (16.67%), hair coat of cow (15%), Milker's hand and milking utensils and water (11.11% each), and udder wash and soil (8.33% each). For identification of virulence genes, all the isolates were subjected to mPCR, of 75 isolates 73.33% of isolates harbored stx 2 gene while 53.33, 36, and 36% of isolates were encoded by stx 1, eae A, and hly A genes, respectively. On epidemiological survey, the multiple risk factors accountable for occurrence of EHEC in raw milk were found to be the quality of water used, improper and inadequate udder preparation, unhygienic hands of Milker's, use of insufficiently cleaned milking utensils, and using common utensil for washings of udder and milking purposes.
   Conclusion: The result of the present study signifies that raw milk was contaminated with EHEC and possesses a high public health threat. As dairy cattle and its environment serve as a potential niche for EHEC, hygienic milking practices should be adopted to curb the occurrence of EHEC in raw milk.

TI  - Analysis of participation in collective action initiatives for addressing unilateral agri-environmental externalities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - The fact that agriculture is associated with negative external effects on ecosystems is of great concern. Most of these agri-environmental externalities are public goods in nature and therefore solving them through conventional market and regulation tools is challenging. Collective action has been identified as an option in dealing with externalities emanating from activities touching on agriculture and the environment especially in circumstances where markets and government regulation are not effective. In this paper, we assess the potential for collective action in addressing agri-environmental externalities. The study achieves this objective using crosssectional household survey data collected from 307 households in the Lake Naivasha basin, Kenya. Results indicate that non-participation in collective action initiatives is a dominant strategy in the Lake Naivasha basin. The study also identifies factors that influence the probability of participating and therefore could be catalysts to encourage participation. Such factors include expected private incentives, labour endowments and agricultural commercialization. Positive perceptions and attitudes, the presence of social sanctions and norms of trust were also found to significantly influence participation. To deal with agri-environmental challenges through collective action, policy needs to focus on facilitating selective incentives, awareness creation and embracing local participation in resource management.

TI  - Factors Influencing the Stability of Contract Farming: An Empirical Study in China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - This paper aimed to study the factors influencing the stability of contract farming. The empirical basis for our analysis was the data survey of 332 fruit households in China in 2017 and 2018. The main result of this study was that contract stability was significantly influenced by household characteristics, production characteristics, and contract terms. Specifically, the constraints in education, family asset, and farm scale were related to a higher rate of farmers' contract breach; contract terms with floor pricing, bonus, and long duration were associated with a lower rate of farmers' contract breach. Additionally, we found that farmers with greater risk aversion and patience were less likely to breach their contracts. Furthermore, the subsample result showed that farmers might be heterogeneous regarding the factors influencing contract breach. Contract stability is a relatively less researched dimension of contract farming, and we expect the paper to be a good addition to the existing literature on contract farming.

TI  - Determinants of Farmers' Willingness to Pay and Its Level for Ecological Compensation of Poyang Lake Wetland, China: A Household-Level Survey
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study examines the determinants of farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) and their payment levels for ecological compensation of the Poyang Lake Wetland in China. We developed a farmer household survey and gathered 292 effective responses. The contingent valuation method (CVM) and Heckman's two-step model were employed for the empirical study. Results show that 46.58% of farmers are willing to pay ecological compensation, with an average price of $64.39/household per year. The influencing factors that significantly influence farmers' WTP include household income, residential location, emphasis on improvement of wetland resources, arable land area, and contracted water area. In addition, household income, residential location, arable land area, and contracted water area are significantly related to their payment levels. The results of this empirical study inform important policy implications and recommendations.

TI  - Effect of Breed Types and Castration on Carcass Characteristics of Boer and Large Frame Indigenous Veld Goats of Southern Africa
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary
   The purpose of this paper is to describe and compare the carcass characteristics of same-aged young wethers and bucks of Boer Goat (BG) and Indigenous Veld Goats (IVG: Cape Speckled and the Cape Lob Ear)-a collective name for the eco-types conserved by the Indigenous Veld Goat Society of South Africa. Results of this study showed that, under the same production conditions, IVG could have a similar potential for meat production. Carcass characteristics differed more between wethers and bucks than between breed types. Large frame Indigenous Veld Goat (IVG) bucks seemed particularly suited for meat production, due to higher meat yield that is leaner with lower subcutaneous and intramuscular fat, compared to the BG bucks and, in particular, to the wethers of both breed types. The wethers meat with increased subcutaneous and intramuscular fat could satisfy another consumer market segment that prefer a somewhat juicier and flavorsome meat-these aspects warrant further research. Development of the formal commercial market for goat meat would offer more diversity of species for red meat producers and especially benefit smallholder farmers who typically produce most of the goats in the world.
   Weaner male Boer Goats (BG; n = 36; 21 bucks and 15 wethers) and large frame Indigenous Veld Goats (IVG; n = 41; 21 bucks and 20 wethers) were raised on hay and natural grass ad libitum and the recommended amount of commercial pelleted diet to a live weight between 30 and 35 kg. Carcass quality characteristics (live weight, carcass weights, dressing %, chilling loss and eye muscle area) were measured. The right sides of the carcasses were divided into wholesale cuts and dissected into subcutaneous fat, meat and bone. Large frame Indigenous Veld Goat (IVG) wethers were slightly lighter than the IVG bucks with no significant difference observed between BG. Wethers compared to bucks had higher dressing %, subcutaneous fat % in all primal cuts, intramuscular fat %, kidney fat % and, overall, slightly less bone %. Some breed-wether interactions were noticed: IVG wethers were slightly lighter than the IVG bucks, but the IVG bucks tended to produce higher % meat compared to other test groups. Judged on the intramuscular fat % characteristics, it seems as if wethers should produce juicier and more flavorsome meat compared to bucks.

TI  - Secure tenure or equal access? Farmers' preferences for reallocating the property rights of collective farmland and forestland in Southeast China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Understanding farmers' preferences for efficiency and equity regarding different land use rights is necessary for the success of land reforms because economic efficiency with equity is the key distinguishing feature of China's land reforms. This paper presents a comparative analysis of farmers' preferences for tenure security (a measure of efficiency) and distribution equality in two similar but distinct land use practices: reallocating physical farmland and reallocating forest monetary shares, both of which contradict government-imposed tenure individualization policies but have long co-existed in some parts of Southeast China. The analysis includes farmers' self-interested as well as prosocial motivations. Data from 222 households, collected from five communities using surveys and a public good game, shows that farmers have a high preference for distribution equality over tenure security in both types of land reallocations. Using bivariate probit models, we find farmers' preferences for reallocating land property rights are associated with their prosocial preferences, but the influence of prosocial preferences varies across reallocations. Moreover, the higher cost of implementing farmland reallocations contributes to farmers' higher preference for tenure security in farmland reallocations than in forest shareholdings reallocations. The research provides empirical evidence of the influence of prosocial motivations on farmers' land property rights preferences and demonstrates that farmers in the same communities may have different preferences for land property rights for two land uses (agriculture and forestry), and the influencing factors and their influence on land property rights preferences may also vary across land uses.

TI  - Space making and home making in the world's first villages: Reconsidering the circular to rectangular architectural transition in the Central Anatolian Neolithic
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY
AB  - In the beginning of the 8th millennium BCE, the people of As,ikli Ho center dot yak dramatically changed how they constructed their buildings. People no longer constructed circular, semi-subterranean residential buildings and instead started to build above ground rectangular buildings. The long-term As,ikli Ho center dot yak excavations help us understand the tempo and organization of this important evolutionary transition. This study advances discussion in three ways: 1) it provides a fine grained understanding of the diachronic shift in social and economic practices, 2) through broad horizontal excavation, this research provides new insights into the built environment, including the opportunity to understand the synchronic organization of residential and non-residential spaces, and 3) this study puts forth a detailed understanding of the evolutionary shift from circular-oval to rectangular architectural practices within a single residential setting. Collectively, the long-term research project at As,ikli Ho center dot yak, with extensive horizontal excavations and detailed radiocarbon dating project, advances our understanding of the changing social and economic context of the transition from circular to rectangular residential buildings.

TI  - Auction winning, social dynamics and non-compliance in a payment for ecosystem services scheme in Indonesia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Conservation auctions for payment for ecosystem services (PES) are useful to identify the levels of incentives that will cover the opportunity costs of farmers supplying ecosystem services. Although auctions are increasingly used for allocation in PES schemes, the factors that lead to their successful implementation and eventual environmental outcomes are poorly understood in developing countries. We investigated the socio-economic and institutional contexts that led to smallholders' auction winning and eventual compliance using linear mixed-effects models, and post-auction and post-contract surveys. We employed a case study of a conservation contract preceded by a sealed-bid, multiple round, uniform price auction for watershed services from coffee farmers in Lampung, Indonesia. The auction participants presented low education levels, low asset endowments and small plot sizes. The study obtained evidence that farmers with larger plot areas were more likely to win the contracts, suggesting economies of scale. Most farmers considered the auction a fair self-selection mechanism to allocate contracts where allocation was not influenced by power or social rank. Non-compliance was associated with labor availability constraints, short duration of land ownership and existence of previous conservation applications, suggesting lax of capability to invest in applying conservation agriculture. Final bids were however not good predictors of compliance, among other factors, calling into question the potential of auctions to elicit the actual incentive from the farmers. Ensuring that farmers understand the purposes of auctions for effective contract allocation beyond a mere game and identifying farmers that might encounter difficulties fulfilling the contract could increase the likelihood that such a PES scheme would be successful.

TI  - Oral history and traditional ecological knowledge in social innovation and smallholder sovereignty: a case study of erva-mate in Southern Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - We outline preliminary results of an ongoing research project conducted in collaboration with traditional erva-mate (yerba mate) producers in Southern Parana and Northern Santa Catarina, Brazil. The multidisciplinary project includes researchers in the natural and social sciences, forest engineers, historians, rural outreach workers, and farmers and is the result of a long-term engagement with smallholder erva-mate producers. Previous research on forest conservation and use in the region had highlighted the important role smallholder farmers play in maintaining forest cover, but knowledge about how farmers and their families perceive traditional erva-mate production systems and understand their environment were needed. Taking a participatory action research approach, our goal is to work with communities to cocreate and share knowledge, ensuring that the research is based on collectively defined goals. Herein, we focus on some of the major themes identified through oral history interviews, particularly in terms of tensions between smallholder farmers and legal frameworks, as well as insecurity in terms of the continuation of traditional, agroecological practices and their importance for the forest. The project aims to engage a range of stakeholders and actors and incorporate a variety of perspectives in understanding forest conservation through use in agroforestry and agroecological systems, particularly in terms of erva-mate production.

TI  - Property Rights, Village Political System, and Forestry Investment: Evidence from China's Collective Forest Tenure Reform
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - To investigate the effect of improved property rights and, in particular, village democracy under China's Collective Forest Tenure Reform (Tenure Reform) on household forestry investments, we estimate both tobit models and the more general Cragg models for farmers' labor and monetary inputs into forestry, using survey data of 652 households from the southern collective forest region of China. The results reveal that the improved forestland use and disposition rights had a significant effect on household investments in forestry, while the beneficiary right did not. In addition, the results suggest that village democracy had a positive effect on households' forestry investments. More importantly, we find that village democracy was able to significantly strengthen the investment incentive effect of the improved property rights under the Tenure Reform. These effects may be explained by the fact that village democracy improved households' perception, cognition, and, subsequently, confidence toward, in particular, the use and disposition rights of the forests entitled to them. Therefore, the findings suggest that to increase the investment incentives of the Tenure Reform further, governments could strengthen the bundle of households' use and disposition rights, as well as their related policies. Also, our findings indicate that governments could significantly improve the performance of public policies by effectively employing democratic procedures in the process of policy implementation.

TI  - Assessment of risk factors and isolation of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli from bovine subclinical mastitic milk in and around Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - A cross-sectional study with simple random sampling approach was conducted from November 2017 to May 2018 with the objectives of estimating the prevalence of subclinical mastitis with its associated risk factors and to identify and isolate Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli from mastitic milk in and around Gondar town, Ethiopia. The study was conducted on 334 lactating cows selected from 70 smallholder dairy farms. California mastitis test (CMT) and bacteriological culture methods were used as diagnostic tools. From 334 cows examined, 114 (34.1%) and from 1054 quarters examined, 238 (17.8%) were positive for subclinical mastitis using CMT test. Adult and old cows were 3.681 (95% CI=1.541, 8.788) and 15.044 (95% CI=3.051, 74.174) times more likely to have a chance of contracting mastitis than young cows respectively. Cow's having 4-7 calving were 88.9% (OR=0.111, 95% CI=0.29, 0.423) less likely to have a chance of contracting mastitis than cows having 3 calving by keeping another factors constant. Mid-lactating cows were 63.4% (OR=0.366, 95% CI=0.150, 0.890) less likely to have a chance of contracting mastitis than cows in the early lactation stage. Crossbreed cows were also 79.1% (OR=0.209, 95% CI=0.046-0.948) less likely to have a chance of contracting mastitis than local breed cows. The odds of subclinical mastitis were 21.81 (95% CI=4.618, 103.002) times higher in cows having tick infestation compared to cows without tick infestation and animals kept in good housing were 23% (OR=0.73, 95% CI=0.027, 0.197) less likely to have mastitis than cows kept in poor housing. The likelihood of mastitis occurrence was 3.372 (95% CI=0.865, 13.141) times higher in cows managed in intensive farming system than semi-intensive farming system. Out of fifty CMT positive milk samples, proportion of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was 17 (34%) and 8 (16%) respectively. As a conclusion, subclinical mastitis is the main important health constraints of dairy cows in the study area. Therefore, management, housing, and environmental sanitation should be improved.

AB  - Achieving carbon neutrality in agricultural production is a common challenge faced by agricultural development around the world. If China's agriculture sector intends to achieve the "dual carbon " goal, the focus should be on the agricultural carbon emission of smallholder farmers and their organized production. This study discusses the impact of smallholder structure and organized production on carbon emission, and the interaction mechanism. To describe the causal relationship and mechanism, the structural degree of smallholder farmers and the total carbon emission in the regions were measured, the provincial panel data were constructed, and then the fixed-effects model and intermediary mechanism test were used for empirical analysis. The results show that in the current stage of agricultural development, the high proportion of smallholders in the region will lead to more agricultural carbon emissions. Although organized production services can reduce carbon emissions, the structure of smallholders will inhibit the scale of the organization, thus hindering carbon emission reduction. It is stated that inhibition is the intermediary path for carbon emissions. This study suggests that the government should improve policies to guide smallholders to operate on an appropriate scale, strengthen policies to encourage smallholders to use socialized agricultural production services, and support smallholders in developing highly valuable ecological agriculture.

TI  - A sustainable approach for livelihood improvement and integrated natural resource management in Central Himalaya, India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
AB  - The present study highlights augmentation of livelihood and natural resource management in the Central Himalayan region by promoting community-specific strategies, adoption of appropriate technologies, diversification of on-farm and off-farm activities, cash-crop production, and supporting ecological restoration and natural resource management. A cluster of eight villages having 470 households was targeted and actions related to community mobilization, micro-planning, technology demonstration and dissemination, the establishment of market linkages, capacity-building and formation of self-help groups were undertaken. Farmers adopted nine technology packages that diversified agriculture in waste/abandoned lands. Management of forests and use of Chir-pine needles for making by-products not only provided an additional source of livelihood but also helped in controlling forest fire. Facilitating linkages with line departments helped to acquire benefits of government schemes. It is recommended that region-specific approach, collective action, targeting weaker sections and women, efficient natural resource management, livelihood enhancement, and capacity-building and community empowerment will lead to a sustainable approach for community development in the Himalayan region.

TI  - Factors Affecting Smallholder Farmers' Marketing Channel Choice in China with Multivariate Logit Model
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Facing the changes in China's agricultural products marketing channel, smallholder farmers with different characteristics choose various strategies to obtain more benefits. To analyze factors affecting smallholder farmers' marketing channel choice, we classify four types of channels-Broker Channel, Farmers' Retailing Channel, Wholesale Market Channel, and Cooperative Channel-and inspect 14 variables based on the survey data of 317 households from four provinces. We use a principal components analysis (PCA) to simplify these 14 variables into seven common factors and a multivariate logit model to study how the factors influence smallholder farmers' choices. We find that compared with the Broker Channel, the Farmers' Retailing Channel is mainly affected by the logistics factor, skill factor, risk factor, and size factor; the Wholesale Market Channel is influenced by the logistics factor and age factor; and the Cooperative Channel is mainly influenced by the age factor, logistics factor, and price factor. In conclusion, the logistics factor has a significant positive effect on each channel choice, and the improvement of the market and transportation conditions has a general promoting effect.

TI  - Toward better institutional setup in spate irrigation system: the case study of Yandafero-Konso lowland spate irrigation system, Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB  - The Yandafero spate irrigation system, both traditional and modern, has experienced community floodwater management for the last 25 years. However, most of the intakes were severely damaged by high flood. The weak relationship between governmental organization and water users, absence of policy and institutional structure for operation and maintenance, result conflicts on water sharing at upstream and downstream, then lead to collapse or dysfunctional of scheme. Hence, the study was conducted to evaluate the existing performance of institutional setup concerning operation and maintenance, water sharing and conflict management, provision of self-finance and performance impacts on agricultural productivity and recommendation that build strengths and address limitations of current institutions for better spate flow management in Yandafero-Konso lowland. Primary data including socio-economic data like household income were collected through a household survey and questionnaires. Interview, focus group discussion and field visit were employed to understand operational and maintenance activities. Grey literature and documents were also used to realize the general description and role of organizations in Yandafero spate system. Then five principals: right to organize, operation and maintenance of infrastructure, water sharing dynamics, conflict resolution mechanism and facilities for self-finance were developed to evaluate the existing institutional arrangement. As the study showed that farmers were organized under formal and informal Irrigation Water User Cooperative (IWUC), out of the nine proposed IWUCs, only three of them got the right to be organized with clearly stated (written) responsibilities. Oneya and Potota sub-schemes were with poor status of diversion weir such as damaging of headwork, barred gate, malfunction of flood flash that results in high accumulation of sediment on the weir. Though water rights and distribution rule were similarly established among three schemes, their performance was varying. In Potota sub-scheme, negligence of enforcement of water distribution regulation and codification was experienced compared to Oneya (56.7%) and Tarakoma (43.3%). There was good performance of IWUC at Oneya and Tarakoma sub-schemes regarding the construction irrigation canals and ensuring equal floodwater distribution. Conflict resolution mechanism was established only at Oneya and Tarakoma sub-schemes. Farmers practiced credit and loan facilities for self-finance through formal cooperative mechanisms. In Potota sub-scheme, the average annual production before and after the improvement of diversion weir was the same (< 1000 kg per annual), whereas dramatic increment was witnessed at Oneya and Tarakoma (> 4000 kg per annual).

TI  - Roles of Motivation, Opportunity, Ability, and Trust in the Willingness of Farmers to Adopt Green Fertilization Techniques
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Green fertilization technologies such as the formula fertilization technology and the water and fertilizer integration technology are important technologies to realize fertilizer reduction and replacement. To explore the willingness of farmers to adopt those technologies and its driving path, can help to improve soil quality and promote the sustainable development of agriculture. In this paper, trust is incorporated into the theoretical framework of motivation, opportunity, ability (MOA). Based on the questionnaire survey data of citrus farmers in Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces in China, the logical relationship of farmers' willingness to adopt green fertilization technology is analyzed from four aspects of adoption motivation, adoption opportunity, ability (technical operation ability and ant risk ability), and trust by using a structural equation model. The results showed that adoption motivation, adoption opportunity, technical operation ability, and anti-risk ability had significant positive direct effects on adoption willingness, which were 0.610, 0.381, 0.491, and 0.297, respectively. Trust had an indirect effect, which was 0.191. From the results of cross-group analysis, it can be seen that farmers' participation in organizations or contracts signed will strengthen the influence of adoption opportunity, technical operation ability and adoption motivation on adoption willingness. However, the influence of the anti-risk ability on adoption willingness was strengthened by the non-participation or non-contract peasant household groups.

TI  - Smallholder farmers' social networks and resource-conserving agriculture in Ghana: a multicase comparison using exponential random graph models
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - We examined what type of information network structures lie within rural cooperatives and what these structures mean for promoting resource-conserving agriculture. To better understand whether and how environmental outcomes are linked to these microlevel social relations or network structures, we quantified individual farm-and community-level biomass accumulation and carbon stocks associated with the adoption of agroforestry, a set of farming techniques for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resilience. We also collected social network data on individual farmers across five communities. This empirical evidence was derived from primary fieldwork conducted in the Ghanaian semideciduous cocoa (Theobroma cacao)-growing region. This data set was examined using standard network analysis, combined with exponential random graph models (ERGMs). The key findings suggest that farmers with more biomass accumulation from the adoption of agroforestry practices also tend to be popular advisers to their peers at the local level. Presumably, farmers seek peers who demonstrate clear signs of achieving successful land management goals. Using ERGMs, we also show that commonly observed individual-level results might not scale to the collective level. We discuss how our individual-scale findings could be leveraged to foster farmer-to-farmer social learning and knowledge exchange associated with resource-conserving agricultural practices. However, we also highlight that effective whole networks, such as cooperative collectives in these communities, remain elusive.

TI  - Remembered resilience: oral history narratives and community resilience in agroforestry systems
T2  - RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - In this article, I consider how local oral history narratives provide smallholder farmers with both material and symbolic resources in adapting to climate change. I draw from the case study of an agrarian village in Madagascar that was struck by a destructive category 3 cyclone. In the weeks following the storm, oral history knowledge occupied an increasingly visible role within the community, as younger farmers interacted with elders to hear tales of past storms. Through these shared accounts, people discussed specific techniques on how to cope with environmental uncertainty. They also created a sense of shared history, which provided individuals across generations an entry point into the local historical record. Overall, the process of sharing oral history accounts can contribute to community resilience, with resiliency encompassing not only technical or ecological factors, but also the more affective realms of shared legacies, hope and belonging.

TI  - Revitalizing Mountain Ginseng Cultivation in North Jeolla Province, South Korea
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - A study was made of measures to revitalize mountain ginseng cultivation in the eastern mountainous area of Muju, Jinan and Jangsu municipalities of North Jeolla province, South Korea. The targeted area is typical forested land and is utilized for the cultivation of ginseng. Access to seeds and seedlings for mountain ginseng cultivation is relatively easy in North Jeolla province, and the species is cultivated widely (on 63 % of the area of the province and by 74 % of farmers). This study investigated the current state of mountain ginseng cultivation and business management, including production costs and subsidy, sales and distribution system, and other business management concerns. A survey was conducted on 86 mountain ginseng-cultivating farming households living in the targeted area in 2013. It is concluded that to achieve greater production an aggressive government policy promoting the renting out of suitable sites for mountain ginseng cultivation in national and public production forestland to individual farms and farming cooperatives is necessary. Further research on increasing the survival rate of cultivated mountain ginseng (CMG) until harvesting and preventing damage by wild animals is also deemed necessary. More effective use of related municipal budget subsidy needs to be supported selectively to the enterprising farmers who aggressively pursue mountain ginseng cultivation and business management. Opening CMG retail stores to realize sustainable income growth and developing various processed products will increase farm income. The government needs to introduce policies to sustain consumer trust in CMG through initiatives such as establishing a CMG quality management system for growers, distributing government-approved seeds, and implementing a government-based CMG purchase system.

TI  - Geographical indications, terroir, and socioeconomic and ecological sustainability: The case of tequila
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - In this paper, we use the case of tequila to examine the potential for geographical indications (GIs) to contribute to socioeconomic and environmental sustainability. GIs are place-based names (e.g., Champagne, Roquefort) that convey the geographical origin, as well as the cultural and historical identity, of agricultural products. The GI for tequila was established by the Mexican government in 1974, making it the oldest GI, and one of the best-recognized, outside of Europe. Here, we examine the social, economic, and ecological impacts that the agave-tequila industry has had on one community in tequila's region of origin, the town of Amatitan. We show that persistent cycles of surplus and shortage of agave and changing production relations in the agave-tequila industry have led to: (I) economic insecurity among farm households; (2) increased use of chemical inputs, at the expense of more labor-intensive cultivation practices; and (3) overall declines in fertilizer application. especially during periods in which there is a surplus of agave. We argue that the negative effects of the agave-tequila industry on the local economy and environment are due to the failure of the GI for tequila to value the ways in which the terroir of tequila's region of origin have contributed to its specific properties. We conclude by using this case to discuss more generally the relationship between the protection of place-based products (known collectively as geographical indications) and social and environmental sustainability.

TI  - Ensuring a future for collective forestry in China's southwest: Adding human and social capital to policy reforms
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
CP  - Workshop on Community-based Forestry in the Next Decade - Towards and Agrarian Approach
AB  - Worldwide, the potential of smallholder forestry to meet policymakers' economic and environmental objectives is gaining increased recognition. In Southwest China, a significant portion of forests are owned and managed by smallholder, village collectives. Decisions made now will determine whether the potential of collective forestry in Southwest China can be realized, or whether smallholder forests are ultimately consolidated into larger holdings. This analysis traces the history of collective forest management in four villages in northwest Yunnan, highlighting four issues fundamental to unlocking the potential of collective forestry: policy support, forestry approach, village institutions, and multi-scale governance. Policy reforms are necessary but not sufficient as a means to bring improvements in these four areas. Investments in human and social capital-linked to the process of building more formal institutions-are essential beside longer-term institutional change. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Between vulnerability and resilience: the experience of the Covid-19 pandemic in two oasis societies in the Maghreb region
T2  - CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB  - From mid-March 2020 onwards, the Algerian and Moroccan governments instituted a lockdown to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in the closure of local markets and mobility restrictions. Even though these measures were implemented halfway through the agricultural year, the media and scientific coverage of the impact of the pandemic focused mainly on urban areas, leaving aside the experiences of rural people. This article aims to partially fill this gap by analysing how smallholder farmers, women and men, young producers, and workers in two oasis regions in the Maghreb, experienced these new challenges. To do so, we rely on 150 phone interviews conducted with rural actors in the Draa Valley (Morocco) and the M'zab Valley (Algeria). By putting their experiences at the heart of our analysis, we show how the health crisis has put constraints on the ability of the majority of smallholder farmers to sell their products and how it has put a strain on the various activities of oasis families, making them more vulnerable. Then, we illustrate how these actors developed different individual and collective resilience practices, through the establishment of a virtual labor market to replace the traditional moquefs (places of recruitment of workers), the adoption of agroecological practices, and the reinvention of solidarity and collective action.

TI  - Moral hazard and Marshallian inefficiency: Evidence from Tunisia
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - We formalize the link between optimal cost-sharing contracts and the production technology in the presence of moral hazard by appealing to several well-known results from duality theory. Building on intuitions from the interlinkage literature, we show that optimal contractual structure is determined by the (i) substitution possibilities that exist between different observable factor inputs, as well as (ii) between these inputs and unobservable effort. We endogenize contractual choice using landlord characteristics as instruments, exploiting the fact that, in our dataset, landlords interact with several tenants and vice versa. The approach is applied to an unbalanced plot-level panel of cost-sharing contracts in a Tunisian village, using a translog representation of the restricted profit function. Contractual terms are found to be a significant determinant of input use and therefore lead to Marshallian inefficiency, while the optimality of the underlying contractual structure is rejected.

TI  - Women and Climate Stress: Role Reversal from Beneficiaries to Expert Participants
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Women, especially in the marginalized communities of the high-risk regions prone to flood and drought are considered most vulnerable to climate change risks. They play a very important role in household nutrition management and resource management in terms of labor, off-farm products, and small savings. In the absence of help from formal and informal R and D and technology institutions, their knowledge and resources' exchange system has to be very robust to cope with the seasonal shortages arising due to climate fluctuations. The study found that these exchanges, spilling over caste or class boundaries, serve as valuable informal safety nets and contribute to household resilience. Researchers seeking to strengthen community coping strategies should pursue such polices and institutional interventions which strengthen women's resource exchange and exploitation mechanisms. We offer in the end a 4-E model involving exchange, expertise, ethics, and environmental consciousness which describes how these empower women and help in articulation of their unique coping strength at intra- and inert community levels. Lateral learning among community members sustains and enhances over time collective and household coping strategies with climate risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Occurrence and distribution of species of Enterobacteriaceae in selected Ethiopian traditional dairy products: A contribution to epidemiology
T2  - FOOD CONTROL
AB  - A total of 316 samples of traditional milk and milk products (66 milk, 52 Ergo - naturally fermented milk, 66 butter, 66 buttermilk and 66 Ayib, Ethiopian cottage cheese); 20 samples of cleaning water and 20 samples of udder swabs were collected in the central highlands of Ethiopia to assess the occurrence and distribution of enteric bacteria. A total of 534 isolates distributed among 10 genera and 20 species were identified. Klebsiella, Escherichia and Enterobacter were the dominant genera in their order of abundance with Escherichia coli, the most prevalent species. Erwinia, Klyuuera and Providentia were the least abundant genera. Most of the genera/species identified were isolated predominantly from milk samples followed by butter and buttermilk during the dry season and from milk, buttermilk and butter during the wet season in order of their abundance. The overall mean aerobic mesophilic, coliform and enterobacterial counts of dairy products were 8.3, 4.5 and 5.2 log cfu mL(-1) or g(-1), respectively. Ergo samples had 0.7 more log cfu of aerobic mesophilic count than butter samples. Coliform and enterobacterial counts were generally lower in samples of fermented milk products than milk with the largest difference being 1.2 log cfu mL(-1) for coliform and 1 log cfu mL(-1) for enterobacteria between milk and Ergo samples. The highest and lowest coliform counts were 5.2 and 3.9 log cfu mL(-1) or g(-1) in samples collected from cooperative centers and smallholder producers, respectively. The knowledge of the enteric bacterial properties of traditional dairy products is essential for the improvement of quality and preservation of the products thereby provide a wholesome product to the consumer with minimum health risk.

TI  - Agrarian contracts, relations between agents, and perception on energy crops in the sugarcane supply chain: The Peruvian case
T2  - OPEN AGRICULTURE
AB  - Peruvian regions for sugarcane planting produce sugarcanes throughout the year with a high average productivity. The objective of this article is to analyze the role of agents in the sugarcane supply chain to Peruvian mills and their relationship with the practice of agrarian contracts to sugarcane production. The perception of landowners and farmers about bioenergy and their predisposition to plant energy crops is also investigated. Field interviews are conducted with the main agents of the sugarcane production chain in the major producing regions. Statistical analysis of data from field interviews indicates that the relationship between owners and sugarcane producers is of land leasing. Intermediate agents act as a fundamental part of the sugarcane supply chain. The sharecropping or sugarcane purchase contract is an instrument that is established between middlemen and small independent producers, whether they are owners or tenants. The middlemen participation in commercialization can reach 30-40% of the sugarcane production. Most mills prefer to produce sugarcane in own lands. A relatively high degree of inequity in favor of the middlemen appears in the intermediation process because, in general, the mills prefer this intermediation in their commercial practice. A large number of landowners and tenants are familiar with notions of energy crops, particularly in relation to sugarcane and have a positive vision about them for the environmental sustainability. However, their interest in planting bioenergy crops is less. Friendly and equitable relations between agents will provide more economic and social stability to the Peruvian sugarcane agroindustry.

TI  - Contractual arrangements and enforcement in transition agriculture: Theory and evidence from China
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - This paper empirically investigates the relationship between contractual arrangements and their enforcement in Chinese agriculture. Based on an analysis Of a Survey of 100 agribusiness firms engaged in contract farming in Zhejiang province of China, we find that private contract enforcement mechanisms play an important role in influencing smallholders' decisions to breach or fulfill contracts. Contract arrangements such as floor pricing, or requiring smallholders to make specific investments facilitate self-enforcement and significantly improve the smallholder's contract fulfillment rate. This is particularly important in Chinese agriculture since the business environment is characterized by an absence of effective public enforcement institutions.

TI  - Pesticide use and cooperative management of natural enemy habitat in a framed field experiment
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Shifting agricultural land management to one that promotes the use of biological control alongside insecticide spray, requires two key elements: 1) habitat for natural enemies provided by non-crop area within the agricultural landscape, and 2) judicious use of insecticides by farmers. However, barriers to adoption may include low levels of knowledge regarding pests and natural enemies, and the difficulties associated with coordinating among community members. The acts of practicing cautious spraying and of leaving aside land as non-crop habitat (NCH) for natural enemies incur private costs for benefits shared by the community. In this study we tie together several objectives within the analysis of a framed field experiment built around pest management decisions in a smallholder agricultural context. We present results from a within-subjects design (multiple treatments per game group) that estimates a decision model which links behavior back to characteristics of the game, the players, and their group. We examine the relative role these sets of characteristics have in explaining variations in the modeled decisions, including how farmers respond to a nudge (a flat subsidy for allowing land to sit as non-crop habitat) to promote natural enemy services on the land. We observe that group-level characteristics appear to have the greatest roles in explaining how decisions by individuals are made. That is to say, the decision of whether to adopt greater use of NCH has more to do with those around the farmer than the traits of the farmer him or herself. From a policy point of view, it is a signal that (if such game outcomes have any bearing on farm level decisions) conventional data tools (such as household-level data products from household surveys or censuses) may be inadequate in evaluating appropriate incentives, and newer approaches that identify social networks and neighbor/community interactions may be important.

TI  - Food traceability system awareness and agricultural operation: A Study of tea farms in Fujian, China
T2  - FUTURE OF FOOD-JOURNAL ON FOOD AGRICULTURE AND SOCIETY
AB  - China is establishing a Food Traceability System (FTS), but the policy implementation is behind most developed countries. The lack of FTS awareness may be a factor contributing to farming practices that are not consistent with FTS policies. Furthermore, the structure of an agri-food supply chain is a factor influencing farms' compliance with FTS. The present study focuses on pesticide residue control and traceability issues in one of the largest tea production areas in China. It aims to examine the effect of FTS awareness and related policies on tea farms' operations as well as the influences of supply chain structure on the effects of policy awareness.
   In this study the data were collected from Fujian province, which is a traditional, major tea-growing region in China with 18% of national production. Farms were recruited through a Stratified Sampling procedure that included 428 participating farms from the four largest tea-producing counties in Fujian. The participating farms answered questions regarding their awareness of FTS and related policies as well as the supply chain structure. The participants also reported their agricultural record-keeping practices related to pesticide residue control, including pesticide use, pesticide residue test, and sales record.
   The results reveal that farm owners' or operators' FTS awareness has a positive effect on pesticide use and sales record-keeping practice, and the supply chain structure importantly moderates the effects of policy awareness on operations related to pesticide residue control. Compared to independent growers, tea farms within an integrated supply chain were more likely to take pesticide residue tests or keep sales records. The results suggest that increasing FTS awareness among tea growers would be crucial to establish a safe and traceable system. Furthermore, governments need to take the supply chain structure into account.

TI  - Gender and pest management: constraints to integrated pest management uptake among smallholder coffee farmers in Uganda
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - Even though both empirical and field evidence hail integrated pest management (IPM) as promising techniques for cost-effective and environment friendly control of agricultural pests, coffee farmers still rely on pesticides. A post coffee stem borer IPM training survey of 126 farmers reveals that farmers' attitudes toward pesticides is a major constraint to IPM use. Farmers perceived that pesticide use simplifies pest management, produces higher yields and good quality coffee appealing to the buyers. On this basis, they mainly used pesticides compared to IPM practices for Coffee Stem Borer (CSB) pest management. Second, the CSB IPM practices are less appealing because of the high labor requirements and costly nature and therefore a constraint especially to women and the elderly. Consequently, increasing IPM practices uptake requires a deliberate and collective effort of key coffee sector stakeholders to design and implement educational programs aimed at judicious application of pesticides. After that, a continuous testing of more IPM techniques coupled with encouraging farmers to adapt and make modifications on the current practices can potentially reduce pesticide use.

TI  - Do Financial Linkages Ease the Credit Rationing of Forest Rights Mortgage Loans? Evidence from Farm Households in Fujian Province, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Affected by the small scale of forest farmers' land and the imperfect development of the forest land transfer market, China's forest rights mortgage loans have suffered from more serious credit rationing. The application of financial linkage theoretically has the effect of solving credit rationing. However, previous studies on financial linkages have focused on the field of credit lending, whereas the applied studies in the field of mortgage lending are mainly case studies on transaction models, and empirical tests on the application of financial linkages in mortgage lending are lacking. Therefore, to fill this gap, this study analyzed the effect of financial linkage on credit rationing for forestry mortgage loans and the mechanism of action through a study of farmers in Fujian, one of the key collective forestry areas in China, using the PSM method with 785 sample values. The results show the following: (1) Financial linkages have a significant mitigating effect on supply rationing, demand rationing, and the total rationing of forest rights mortgage loans. Compared to non-participation, financial linkages significantly reduced total rationing by 15.2%, with a 5% reduction in supply rationing and a 10.2% reduction in demand rationing. (2) The impact of financial linkage differs significantly among heterogeneous farmers. It has a significant mitigating effect on supply rationing for small-scale farmers, but not for large-scale farmers; meanwhile, it better mitigates demand rationing for large-scale farmers than for small-scale farmers. (3) In the mechanistic test, financial linkages were found to moderate the relationship between the value of collateral and supply rationing for small-scale farmers, and transaction costs play an intermediary role in the relationship between financial linkages and demand-based rationing. According to the study results, in order to promote the development of forest rights mortgage loans, it is necessary to develop different lending strategies for heterogeneous farmers, to further encourage small- and medium-sized farmers to participate in financial linkages, as well as to further reduce the related transaction costs.

TI  - Does experience with natural disasters affect willingness-to-pay for weather index insurance? Evidence from China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
AB  - Managing the risk associated with natural disasters is crucial for agricultural development in developing countries. In this study, we estimate farmers' willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical excess rainfall index insurance contract, with a special interest in whether recent experience with a catastrophic flooding influences farmers' attitude towards the insurance product. The study is based on a survey of small farm households in China's Heilongjiang Province, which suffered a catastrophic flood in the summer of 2013. Employing a natural experiment framework, we find that, other things being equal, farmers from flooded areas have a higher WTP for index insurance than farmers from non-flooded areas.

TI  - THE AFRO-BRAZILIAN COLLECTIVE LAND Analyzing Institutional Changes in the Past Two Hundred Years
T2  - LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH REVIEW
AB  - Afro-Brazilian communities (quilombos) hold rights to a collective territory where they live and that supports their livelihoods. Historically, Afro-Brazilian smallholders have been subjected to contradictory programs and policies that either restrain traditional practices such as shifting cultivation or aim at empowering these communities. This is the first attempt to adopt the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) theoretical framework to study the historical transformation of the institutional structure in Afro-Brazilian territories of the Ribeira Valley, Silo Paulo, Brazil. Our results reveal a history of long-term, continuous relationships between locals and external groups, sometimes combative and at other times cooperative, reflecting tensions and contradictions. As a result, quilombo communities have gradually emerged as leaders in an institutional arrangement that is moving toward co-governance or partnerships. We believe that if these communities achieve full economic and political autonomy, they might be able to self-govern their territories and reconcile the dual goals of local development and environmental conservation.

TI  - Family life cycle and peasant income in socialist China: Evidence from Qin village
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY HISTORY
AB  - Using account books and household registers from a production team of Qin village in Jiangsu Province, China, this article examines the changing laborer-to-dependent ratios in the peasant households over the family life cycle and their effects on income disparity within the collective in the 1970s. It demonstrates that birth control in the late 1970s caused remarkable changes to the family cycle of the households, which in turn affected their economic situation in different phases of the cycle. Moreover, the changing family cycle interwove with different labor remuneration systems to shape economic differentiation in the collective. Income inequality among the households was the greatest in the early 1970s under the egalitarian system and greatly reduced in the late 1970s when work incentives were introduced to the village.

TI  - Towards Sustainable Wood-Based Energy: Evaluation and Strategies for Mainstreaming Sustainability in the Sector
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Bioenergy, mostly from wood biomass, is now widely seen as an important element in the efforts to tame dangerous climate change. At the same time, foresters and development specialists note that wood-based energy production can contribute to rural development. However, to deliver on these two goals without generating negative side effects, wood-based energy has to be sustainable, while currently, the sector is developing rapidly in ways that are technologically advanced, with questionable sustainability. How can sustainability be achieved in bioenergy production, to make it a viable element of climate change mitigation, adaptation, and rural development? Arguing for the need to mainstream sustainability thinking into wood-based energy production, the article draws on a critical literature review to identify four different levels of sustainability in the existing research on bioenergy from wood. It shows two possible strategies for integrating sustainability in wood bioenergy production. A top-down approach draws on global forestry governance instruments, while a bottom-up approach uses best-practices in forest plantations for bioenergy purposes, as illustrated by a case study from rural Paraguay. Using aggregated and visualized sustainability indicators, the article exemplifies what sustainable bioenergy production means in more tangible terms.

TI  - Are non-market values important to smallholders' afforestation decisions? A psychometric segmentation and its implications for afforestation programs
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - We use an innovative approach to improve the effectiveness of smallholder afforestation programs by psychometrically segmenting a population based on preferences for the market and non-market values of trees.
   202 randomly selected smallholders in Nicaragua were presented with nine discrete choice experiments of possible afforestation contracts with varying attribute levels of market and non-market values and were asked in which program they would choose to participate.
   We estimate unobservable smallholder-specific preferences for afforestation program attributes as a function of observable socio-demographic variables using conditional distributions from a random coefficient logit model. Cluster analysis was used to segment the population based on these preferences and socio-demographic characteristics.
   Smallholder preferences for non-market values are found to increase with distance to market and to be more important than market values in afforestation decisions. Two well-defined smallholder segments are identified. The first is characterized as market-oriented, placing less importance on non-market values. The second is characterized as unwilling to participate in afforestation programs without non-market values. These findings cast doubt on the reliance of market values as the primary determinant of smallholders' afforestation decisions and imply that programs could be designed more cost effectively by bundling different attributes for different segments of the population.

TI  - A Bayesian belief data mining approach applied to rice and shrimp aquaculture
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - In many parts of the world, conditions for small scale agriculture are worsening, creating challenges in achieving consistent yields. The use of automated decision support tools, such as Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs), can assist producers to respond to these factors. This paper describes a decision support system developed to assist farmers on the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, who grow both rice and shrimp crops in the same pond, based on an existing BBN. The BBN was previously developed in collaboration with local farmers and extension officers to represent their collective perceptions and understanding of their farming system and the risks to production that they face. This BBN can be used to provide insight into the probable consequences of farming decisions, given prevailing environmental conditions, however, it does not provide direct guidance on the optimal decision given those decisions. In this paper, the BBN is analysed using a novel, temporally-inspired data mining approach to systematically determine the agricultural decisions that farmers perceive as optimal at distinct periods in the growing and harvesting cycle, given the prevailing agricultural conditions. Using a novel form of data mining that combines with visual analytics, the results of this analysis allow the farmer to input the environmental conditions in a given growing period. They then receive recommendations that represent the collective view of the expert knowledge encoded in the BBN allowing them to maximise the probability of successful crops. Encoding the results of the data mining/inspection approach into the mobile Decision Support System helps farmers access explicit recommendations from the collective local farming community as to the optimal farming decisions, given the prevailing environmental conditions.

TI  - Effect of household land management on cropland topsoil organic carbon storage at plot scale in a red earth soil area of South China
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB  - An inventory of topsoil soil organic carbon (SOC) content in household farms was performed in a village from a red earth region in Jiangxi Province, China in 2003. In this region, the farmland managed by each household is fragmented, consisting of several plots of land that are not necessarily adjacent to each other. A statistical analysis of SOC variation with land use and household management type, and with crop management practices was conducted. Plot size ranged from 0.007 to 0.630 ha with a mean of 0.1 ha, and SOC content ranged from 1.72 to 25.2 g/kg, varying widely with a variety of land management and agricultural practices, arising from individual household behaviours. The mean SOC content in plot size <0.1 ha was 20 A lower than in plot size >= 0.1 ha. SOC of dry crop plots was 70% lower than that in rice paddies, and SOC of plots contracted from the village was almost double that of plots leased from other householders. Moreover, a 30% increase in SOC was observed with green manure cultivation, and a 55% increase under triple cropping. The difference in SOC levels between the least and most favourable cases of household land management and agricultural practice was up to 150%. The results suggest that policies targeted at crop management alone may not deliver the expected SOC benefits if household land management is also not improved.

TI  - Structure conduct and performance of dairy market in Ada'a Berga district, Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - The aim of this article was to investigate SCP of milk and butter market in Ada'a Berga District using SCP model. Primary data collected from randomly selected 123 smallholder farmers, 48 traders and 30 consumers were used to calculate the gross margin, concentration ratio(CR), regulation of market entry and exit and market conduct. The CR results showed that top four milk traders controlled 78.8% and 89.54% of the total volume of milk sold in Ada'a Berga and Holeta, respectively, and 61.29% and 63.46% butter sold in Ada'a Berga and Holeta, respectively. The CR of milk and butter markets were strongly oligopolistic. Education, market transparency and capital, political equality, corruption were barrier to entry milk and butter trade. The conduct analysis results showed that farmers use different markets outlets and price setting strategies to sell dairy products. The result of pricing setting was not competitive as 51.67% dairy price decisions were decided by buyers. In milk marketing, the maximum total gross marketing margin of producers share was 63.15% in channel III (producer, district retailer to consumers). The maximum producer's share in butter market was in channel V (producer, district retailer to consumers). Therefore, strengthening institutions that convey reliable and timely market information; support dairy market, improving collective action of farmers, address the challenges of financial access to smallholder farmers and traders to decrease oligopolistic nature of the market. Moreover, give attention to market infrastructural, training and yield increasing technologies in the study area to improvement production and marketing of dairy products.

TI  - Seroprevalence and Risk Factors of Chlamydia Infection in Cattle in Shanxi Province, North China
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary Chlamydia, an important zoonotic pathogen, poses a serious threat to public health and the development of animal husbandry. Shanxi Province, famous for its Loess Plateau terrain, has been taking cattle and sheep husbandry as an important direction of development, which means that it is necessary to prioritize the detection of pathogens in cattle and sheep. In this study, based on the location and management pattern, the seroprevalence of Chlamydia and C. abortus infection in cattle in Shanxi Province was examined by indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The results revealed a high (52.29%) overall seroprevalence of Chlamydia in cattle in Shanxi Province. Location was closely related to the prevalence of Chlamydia and C. abortus, and different management patterns also had a certain impact on the prevalence of Chlamydia. This study provided valuable baseline information for the prevention and control of Chlamydia in cattle in Shanxi Province. The information on Chlamydia infection in cattle is limited in Shanxi Province, north China. This study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence and risk factors of Chlamydia and Chlamydia abortus infection in cattle in Shanxi Province. In November 2020, a large-scale investigation of Chlamydia seroprevalence was conducted on 981 cattle serum samples collected from 40 cattle farms in 11 cities of Shanxi Province. The seroprevalence of Chlamydia and C. abortus was examined by indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The seroprevalence of Chlamydia and C. abortus was 52.29% (513/981) and 2.96% (29/981), respectively, in cattle in Shanxi Province. Location was identified as a risk factor for Chlamydia and C. abortus infection (p < 0.05). Under different management patterns, the seroprevalence of Chlamydia and C. abortus in large-scale animal farming companies was higher than that in household animal farms and animal farming cooperatives, and only the seroprevalence of Chlamydia was significantly different in different management patterns (p < 0.01). The results showed that there was higher seroprevalence of Chlamydia in cattle in Shanxi Province, while C. abortus was not the dominant species. This study provided baseline information on Chlamydia infection in cattle in Shanxi Province, which constitutes valuable data for monitoring livestock health and preventing potential zoonoses.

TI  - Influences of Government Policies and Farmers' Cognition on Farmers' Participation Willingness and Behaviors in E-Commerce Interest Linkage Mechanisms during Farmer-Enterprise Games
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - E-commerce interest linkage mechanisms serve as an effective solution to the problems of farmer-market cooperation, agricultural supply-side reforms, and farmers' income growth. This study, guided by the theory of planned behavior, undertook an evolutionary game analysis of farmer-enterprise cooperation with government interventions with farmers. Based on data from 554 questionnaires administered in Mei County, Shaanxi Province, China, this study found a difference between the realistic and optimal choices of farmers. In addition, this study used a structural equation model to investigate the influence of government policies and farmers' cognition on the participation willingness and behaviors of farmers in e-commerce interest-linkage mechanisms. The results showed that the optimal choice for farmers in a farmer-enterprise cooperative game is participation in e-commerce, and government policies can be used to improve farmer-enterprise e-commerce interest-linkage mechanisms. Farmers' basic characteristics and experiences impacted their cognition of e-commerce, which, in turn, had a significant positive effect on their e-commerce participation willingness and behaviors. Government policies had a positive effect on farmers' experiences, cognition of e-commerce, and participation behaviors, but no direct positive impact on farmers' willingness to participate. Government policies and farmers' basic characteristics interacted and acted together on the participation willingness and behavior of farmers.

TI  - Information, trust and pesticide overuse: Interactions between retailers and cotton farmers in China
T2  - NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - In the absence of adequate extension services, retailers have become the major information source for farmers' pesticide use in rural China. Pesticide application for smallholders is rather complex, and mistakes can lead to significant crop losses. Farmers, therefore, seek sources of information regarding pesticide use. This paper first explores how different kinds of retailers may employ different strategies of providing information to farmers. We find that for village, town, and county retailers, the more familiar they are with farmers, the more likely they are to amplify the recommended dosage of pesticide use. In cooperatives, who buy pesticides from an extension station, the information is directly transferred to member farmers without information distortion. Apart from examining retailers' different strategies of information provision, this paper also asks in how far farmers' trust in retailers may affect pesticide use. It finds that trust in different kinds of retailers indeed varies and plays a critical role in converting information into farming behavior. Members of the cooperative show rather high levels of trust in their retailer, while farmers who are not members of a cooperative show low levels of trust in retailers. Pesticide use is a joint result of retailers' information provision strategies and farmers' trust. The lowest pesticide use occurs when accurate information is provided and when farmers highly trust the information provider. Overuse occurs with either information distortion or low levels of trust. Cooperatives have advantages both in terms of information provision and trust, thereby leading to the lowest use of pesticides. (C) 2014 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences.

TI  - Linkages among forest, water, and wildlife: a case study from Kalapani community forest in the Lamahi bottleneck area of Terai Arc Landscape
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS
AB  - Forests and water are important entities for sustaining life on earth. In a terrestrial ecosystem, linkages between the entities creates a mosaic benefiting wildlife. In turn, communities get benefits stemming up from ecosystem services such as fodder, fuelwood, and water. We present a case study from a forest restoration project to assess the linkages between forest, water and wildlife across the Lamahi bottleneck area in Terai Arc Landscape. We used a combination of surveys such as forest area and canopy cover change (2001-2016) analysis followed by identification of water sources, camera trapping survey, household questionnaire survey, and process documentation. Forest area has increased by similar to 20 km(2) in last 15 years followed by number of water sources along the identified tributaries. Water sources are conserved in the form of conservation ponds by communities living downstream and utilized irrigation water in vegetable farming. Communities have benefited financially (similar to US$ 1252) contributing to their income level from the sale of fresh seasonal vegetables in nearby markets. Camera trap surveys including the assessment of historical records has shown a presence of wildlife including elephants, hyenas, and other small carnivores in and around the bottleneck forest. Both, motivation and enthusiastic support from local communities followed by conducive government policies led to the improved condition of natural resources over the period. This has also created a mosaic for wildlife forming functional connectivity along the linear Terai Arc Landscape.

TI  - Product quality asymmetry and food safety: Investigating the "one farm household, two production systems" of fruit and vegetable farmers in China
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - The Chinese government faces a great challenge to safeguard the safety of the food supply chain due to the significant fragmentation of producers and weak institutional resources to monitor and enforce safety standards. Food safety in China has received escalating attention since the 2008 milk scandal. Mainly due to safety concerns, Chinese farmers adopt two separate production systems for the market and self-consumption, and thus, the so-called "One Farm Household, Two Production Systems" (OFH-TPS) has gained popularity in the recent years.
   This study provides a theoretical framework to examine how product inspections and certifications affect the OFH-TPS adoption by mitigating information asymmetry of product quality. It also shows that both food safety concerns and cost savings are important factors for Tamers' decision on the adoption. The empirical analysis finds that product inspections conducted by firms, agricultural cooperatives, and farmers curb the OFH-TPS adoption, whereas government inspections have no statistically significant effect. Farmers who grow "Green Food" are less likely but organic farmers are more likely to adopt the OFH-TPS. We also find that pesticide use training curbs the OFH-TPS adoption, and the perceived adverse effects of pesticide use to the environment and human health have no statistical effect. Farmers who use highly toxic or banned pesticides and/or who perceive food safety at the local markets is poor are more likely to adopt the OFH-TPS. This study provides rich policy implications. To safeguard food safety, it is critical to engage the private sector for co-regulation, improve the efficacy of government inspections, and promote education on pesticide use to both farmers as well as retailers of pesticides.

TI  - Prevalence and Associated Factors of Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis in an Endemic Area of Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - ACTA SCIENTIAE VETERINARIAE
AB  - Background: Canine visceral leishmaniasis is a chronic and severe disease of great interest to global public health. In Brazil, the main species causing visceral leishmaniasis is Leishmania chagasi [syn. Leishmania infantum], which is transmitted by sandflies of the species Lutzomyia longipalpis and Lu. cruzi. This study aimed to determine the risk factors and prevalence of visceral leishmaniasis in dogs residing in endemic areas of the municipality of Varzea Grande, Mato Grosso.
   Material, Methods & Results: The study was conducted in the Varzea Grande neighbourhoods Jardim Eldorado, Parque Sabia and Sao Mateus, which are located in the Brazilian Cerrado region and are endemic for visceral leishmaniasis. The Varzea Grande is a mostly commercial and industrial municipality and relies on subsistence farming. To describe the general characteristics of the dog population and housing environment, an interview was carried out with the dog owners in each household. This interview addressed local demographics and the identification of dogs to establish epidemiological aspects of canine illness and risk factors for infection. The dogs were examined and physically restrained for blood collection by jugular venipuncture. For serological testing, a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used. A Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to identify associations between independent variables and the seroprevalence of dogs with anti-Leishmania antibodies. It were collected blood from 521 animals, including 160 belonging to Jardim Eldorado, 129 to Parque Sabia and 232 to Sao Mateus. Of these animals, 120 were reactive by ELISA, with a prevalence of 23.0%. There was no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05) according to gender, age, racial definition, origin, time with family, presence of ectoparasites, or the presence of people with skin wounds at home or on other pets. The major risk factor for canine infection was fur length; dogs with short fur were 2.2 times more likely to be infected than dogs with long fur.
   Discussion: The prevalence of canine leishmaniasis in endemic areas was found to be similar to studies in Cuiaba, a city in Varzea Grande, which also included neighbourhoods endemic for visceral leishmaniasis as study areas. Other studies have shown prevalence rates that differ from those found in this study. This difference may either be because the neighbourhoods in this study had already experienced outbreaks of the disease or because serum samples were cross-reactive with other trypanosomatids. While infection was more readily detected in dogs with clinical signs, asymptomatic dogs with anti-Leishmania antibodies were found in greater numbers, which is consistent with the literature. Hair length was the only factor associated with canine leishmaniasis in this study; short-haired animals were most at risk of contracting the disease because they had more skin exposure to sandflies during blood feeding. In conclusion, endemic districts of Varzea Grande had high prevalence rates of canine visceral leishmaniasis, and a short length coat was associated with infection.

TI  - TECHNICAL AND RESOURCE USED EFFICIENCY OF RICE PRODUCTION IN THE MEKONG DELTA, VIETNAM
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study aims at evaluating the technical efficiency and resource use efficiency in rice production in the Mekong Delta. This study used a parametric estimation method through the stochastic frontier production function under the tanslog form, and was performed using software Frontier 4.1. The research data is the Winter-Spring season - one of the main crops in rice production in this region and in the 2017 - 2018 crop year. The results show that the technical efficiency is 91.5%; and a fraction of one quarter of households has still technical efficiency below 90%. Besides, the efficiency of using input resources is not optimal. Many types of materials such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides have been used in an excess of the necessary and recommended levels of the agricultural agency. The farm-size is not too large, but it is possible that because there are many farm plots, which also adversely affect the technical efficiency and the resource use efficiency. Positive factors that increase technical efficiency need to be focused on for replication such as educational level, production experience, participation in technical training classes, contract farming. This study is expected to have policy implications for rice production in the Mekong Delta in the near future.

TI  - The living university in relation to popular classes in Brazil. A critical analysis of higher education policies
T2  - GLOBALISATION SOCIETIES AND EDUCATION
AB  - This article discusses the relationship between university and popular classes as an alternative to the privatist tendencies of higher education policies, as well as science and technology, in Brazil, in this period of transition from the neo-developmental project to the deepening of counter-reforms, which started in the 1990s. The subject is developed from bibliographical and documental research (Brazilian legislations), besides testimonies from Brazilian researchers who have worked together with family farmers, smallholders, settlers, and recyclable material collectors that are organised in cooperatives and associations. Our analyses are structured in dialogue with the hypothesis of dysfunctionality of the university. A review of higher education and science and technology policies is carried out and considered in regard to inclusion and the relationship with the popular classes. Our focus is on the first decade of the twenty-first century, a brief period of neo-developmentalism that ended with the deepening of the current counter-reforms. Initially, it is analyzed the higher education. Then, it is discussed the trends in Science and Technology policy. This is followed by analyzes of the relationship between university and popular classes, an alternative that is carried out contradictorily. It is concluded that the University recreates itself by contributing to popular classes.

TI  - Understanding the differences in cultivated land protection behaviors between smallholders and professional farmers in Hainan Province, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Cultivated land protection and quality improvement have become inevitable requirements for alleviating ecological and environmental pressure and sustainable agricultural development. It is of practical significance to explore the differences and causes of cultivated land protection behaviors (CLPB) between smallholders and professional farmers for formulating targeted protection policies and improving their effectiveness. Based on 422 mango farmers' survey data in Hainan Province, this paper explored the internal and external characteristics between smallholders and professional farmers, and used the Fairlie decomposition method to compare and analyze the sources of differences in farmers' CLPB. The results showed that: (1) the CLPB of smallholders and professional farmers differ significantly; (2) the sources of differences in CLPB between smallholders and professional farmers are different, including differences in internal characteristics and differences in external characteristics; (3) differences in internal characteristics are the main cause of the differences in farmer's CLPB, and the contribution of differences in external characteristics was smaller, of which planting years, annual household income and planting scale are the top three factors. It is suggested that differential protection policies should be designed for smallholders and professional farmers, such as guiding smallholders to carry out large-scale operations and improve their organizational level, encouraging and guiding professional farmers to sign long-term contracts to stabilize the land tenure, and formulating subsidy policies for cultivated land protection.

TI  - Highly Optimized Tolerant (HOT) Farms in Rondonia: Productivity and Farm Size, and Implications for Environmental Licensing
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - This paper operationalizes the concept of highly optimized tolerance (HOT) for the case of smallholder agriculture in Rondonia, Brazil. It seeks to understand how characteristics of family farms shift as a function of property size, arguing that as production intensifies, properties move closer to a HOT state. In this state, resources are committed to maintaining robustness against expected disturbances, such as shifts in yields or crop prices, making property more vulnerable to other unexpected disturbances, such as shifts in input prices or availability. The shifts in production, labor, and costs that occur across scale in the Ji-Parana River Basin in Rondonia were measured using a survey instrument on a sample of farmers in the basin. Study results show decreasing production intensity with increasing property size in the sample, coupled with decreasing contracted and family labor use intensity, as well as decreased income diversification and off-farm labor. Farms smaller than 60 ha in the sample differed markedly in production and cost structure from those that were larger. For these smaller properties, meeting the requirements of Rondonia's new environmental licensing program (LAPRO) may lead to an increase in the sale of land parcels to cover debts and a speeding up of land consolidation in the region.

TI  - The impact of intensive farming on land tenure: Evidence from Confucius' manors (1759-1901)
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, fixed-rent tenancy gradually replaced sharecropping as the dominant form of land tenancy in China. This paper hypothesizes that the secular shift in land tenure was an adaptation to the change in land utilization system towards more intensive cropping. To test the hypothesis we exploit a dataset gathered from the rent collection archives of Confucius' Lineage in the Qing Dynasty. We estimate the effect of the adoption of wheat-soybean double cropping on the choice of tenancy contract, share contract versus fixed-rent contract. We find that double cropped plots were 23.7% more likely to be managed under fixed-rent contracts than annually cropped plots. Our findings are consistent with the implications of the factor endowment theory. The adoption of double cropping made farming more complex and placed greater demands on managerial inputs of tenants. In the absence of a factor market for managerial ability, optimal tenancy contract had adapted to provide tenants with a greater incentive to supply managerial inputs than had been the case in sharecropping arrangements.

TI  - Return migration and the reiteration of gender norms in water management politics: Insights from a Chinese village
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - Recent work on return migration in China suggests return migrants bring with them new knowledge, skills, and potentially beneficial relationships accumulated during their sojourns, enabling them to introduce new forms of leadership and community action. Social remittances of this kind could be read as carrying the potential to enhance collective action in support of sustainable local natural resource-based livelihoods. This study of the links between return migration, leadership and collective action in water management sounds a more cautionary note, demonstrating that home communities may respond to return migrants in ways that repeatedly mark and reiterate gender and kinship norms, reiterating gender, generational and clan-based social hierarchies. The paper draws on and contributes to recent feminist political ecology approaches to show how migrant returnees' social remittances' translate into leadership in collective action in a rural Chinese village in ways that reinforce existing gender hierarchies and social positions within the community, thus questioning the extent to which any influx of new ideas, relationships and practices acquired from migrant experiences necessarily destabilizes power and authority in the village in any meaningful way.

TI  - Optimization of alternative breeding schemes for the genetic improvement of common Tigray highland sheep in northern Ethiopia
T2  - GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION
AB  - Background Genetic improvement is one of the major means to enhance the productivity of livestock, and well-designed animal genetic improvement schemes are necessary to achieve genetic gains. The objective of the current study was to design an alternative breeding program to improve the productivity of common Tigray highland sheep. Two village- and two central nucleus-based breeding schemes were simulated and evaluated in terms of genetic gain, bio-economic efficiency and operational feasibility. Methods Four breeding schemes were simulated: scheme 1, a one-tier cooperative village-based breeding scheme, scheme 2, a two-tier cooperative village breeding scheme (dispersed village-based nuclei scheme), scheme 3, a central open nucleus-based scheme with 5% nucleus size; and scheme 4, a three-tier breeding schemes (central open nucleus-based linked with multiplier units). Simulation analyses were performed using the ZPLAN computer program, which is based on a deterministic approach to estimate genetic and economic gains in the breeding programs. Results Between the two village-based breeding schemes, scheme 2 showed higher genetic gain and economic efficiency in the breeding traits analysed than scheme 1. The central nuclei schemes were more efficient than the village breeding schemes. Scheme 3 was the most efficient with a genetic gain in the breeding objective of US $ 1.03 and a profit of US $ 2.73/ewe/year, but operationally it is also the most difficult to implement as it requires a big central nucleus. A central nucleus linked with the village-based nuclei would be a feasible option to overcome the operational difficulties of the conventional central nucleus schemes. If a village-based breeding program is considered it should be the first step in most low-input systems. In this case, scheme 2 is the most efficient. Conclusions With some support from the public sector at the outset and a strong collaboration among the stakeholders including smallholders, scheme 4 could lead to substantial genetic gains in the common Tigray highland sheep breed within its habitat that covers large areas of the Tigray region. Therefore, we recommend a long-term breeding program which should include cross-breeding, genomic selection, updated estimates of genetic and economic values for the common Tigray highland sheep breed.

TI  - Inclusive and Ecologically-Sound Food Crop Cultivation at Tropical Non-Tidal Wetlands in indonesia
T2  - AGRIVITA
AB  - Productivity and cropping intensity on non-tidal wetland in South Sumatra are considerably low and has been underutilized up to now. The majority of farmers in this ecosystem are smallholders with limited adoption capacity on introduced technologies and modern agricultural practices. The objectives of this research were (1) to comprehensively capture multidimensional constrains that restrained local farmers in increasing their agricultural productivity; and (2) to identify, assess, and develop substantially-relevant, financially-affordable, and socially-acceptable agricultural technologies and practices for smallholder farmers to increase productivity. This research was organized in three main activities: qualitative research employing Grounded Theory procedure, quantitative questionnaire-guided survey, and a series of laboratory and field experiments. The research results indicated that the main constraints in increasing productivity and cropping intensity on the non-tidal wetland in South Sumatra include (1) unpredictable flooding occurrence and low soil nutrients content (agronomic constraint), (2) low financial and technology adoption capacity of local farmers (economic constraint), and (3) public policy has not significantly escalated farmer's motivation to increase food production (social and institutional constraint). This research suggests that multidimensional (technical, financial, ecological, and socio-cultural) approaches should be integrated in collective efforts for sustainably intensifying food production on the non-tidal wetland.

TI  - The Sustainability of Contract Farming with Specialized Suppliers to Modern Retailers: Insights from Vegetable Marketing in Indonesia
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Specialized suppliers to supermarkets in rural Java showed that smallholder farmers could engage in contract farming with the rise of retail modernization. This paper examines whether they have sustained contract farming with the recent decline of modernized stores. Our field survey, based on cases reported by the World Bank in 2006, provides the following findings: (1) Some suppliers failed to sustain contract farming due to growers' hold-up problems; (2) The suppliers could prevent contract breaching by either undertaking contract-specific investments to train growers or provide inputs. Moreover, they selected growers based on their social reputation to avoid contract breaching; (3) We found that farmers in breach of contract farming on the modern channel begin to arrange farmers' groups by themselves and return to the traditional channel as a new type of intermediaries. This indicates an evolution of the traditional marketing channel with the supermarket revolution.

TI  - Designing collaborative governance: Insights from the drought contingency planning process for the lower Colorado River basin
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - Agriculture, environment, industry, and millions of households in the western US and northern Mexico depend on the Colorado River, which is facing increasing water shortages due to climate change and rising demand. Collaborative governance will likely be key to solving allocation issues and achieving sustainable water use but has recently faced multiple challenges. This research integrates concepts from institutional, adaptive governance, and bargaining theories to analyze barriers and facilitators to collaborative governance in the drought contingency plan (DCP) process for the lower Colorado River basin from an Arizona stakeholder's perspective. The DCP is ultimately an effort to create a set of rules to prevent and address shortages in the basin. Through a content analysis of public meetings of the Central Arizona Project's governing board, we find a collective DCP or future related policy may be possible. But barriers to collaborative governance have intensified over time, hindering the process and making an agreement increasingly unlikely. The process is a perfect example of the interplay between rules and norms, and the issues that arise when norms underlying rules are interpreted differently. Our analysis provides insights for the design of collaborative water governance, including that conducting an analysis of power dynamics among the stakeholders would advance the DCP process. We ultimately argue that the Colorado River basin would benefit from a transition towards adaptive governance, and that our recommendations to improve collaboration are an important initial step. Additionally, our results reveal areas that require more empirical research, including understanding how to prepare for policy windows, rapid trust building among stakeholders, and theory building related to equity and marginalization in collaborative governance processes.

TI  - Effects of the Psaltry Cassava Out-grower Scheme in Enhancing Smallholder Productivity in Oke-Ogun Area of Oyo State, Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION
AB  - This study assessed the effects of Psaltry cassava Out-grower scheme in enhancing smallholder productivity in Oke-Ogun area of Oyo State. Pre- and post-intervention combined with treatment and control group designs were used. Data were collected from 232 Out-grower and 49 non- Out-grower farmers using interview schedules. Data were analysed using percentages, t-test and regression analysis. Assured markets (90.5%) and training on postharvest handling of crops (69.9%) were the most common supports received from Psaltry. Long bureaucracy involved in documentation ((x) over bar =2.23) was the most severe constraint faced in the scheme. Total cassava harvested and productivity among Out-growers increased from 30,950.89 +/- 31,133.48kg to 106,116.88 +/- 96,926.01kg and 5,649.2 +/- 3835.3kg/Acre to 9,143.6 +/- 8799.1 kg/Acre before and after participating in Psaltry scheme, respectively. A significant difference existed between the productivity of Out-growers and non- Out-growers (t=7.256; p <= 0.05). Membership of group (beta=0.319) and length of involvement in the Psaltry scheme (beta=0.157) positively and significantly influenced Out-growers' cassava productivity. The Psaltry Outgrower scheme had stimulated beneficiary's smallholder farmers towards higher productivity. A scale-up of the Psaltry model has prospects for transforming smallholder farmers to commercial producers.

TI  - Economic Valuation of Bee Pollination Services for Passion Fruit (Malpighiales: Passifloraceae) Cultivation on Smallholding Farms in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Using the Avoided Cost Method
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - This paper estimates the economic value of ecosystem services provided by Brazilian native bee, Xylocopa spp. Latreille (Hymenoptera: Apidae), pollination on a scale relevant to individual smallholder farmers that produce yellow passion fruit (Passiflora edulis Sims). The study areas are located in the vicinity of Pedro de Toledo and Itariri (Sao Paulo State-Brazil), in the Atlantic Forest region. The local economy is based on family farms, small stores, and ecotourism. The value was obtained using the ecological economics Avoided Cost Method, also known as replacement cost. Farms from this region informally hire temporary day laborers to supplement natural pollination with manual pollination of passion fruit flowers, so the cost of contracting temporary laborers was used to estimate the economic value of bee pollination. The value of pollination services was estimated at US$2,583.00 per hectare over 2 yr of P. edulis farming. Our estimates based on passion fruit farmer surveys and ecological valuation over 2 yr suggest that manual pollination accounts for 44-48% of production costs and results in a loss of similar to 58% of profits when wild bee pollination services are not available and manual pollination is required. We suggest that smallholder farmers follow the suggestions of previous studies and conserve adequate forest habitat for bee nesting and foraging, plan pesticide use around flowering and pollination, and supplement bee populations to maximize the benefit of the pollination ecosystem service and profits.

TI  - Study on categorization of factors affecting smallholder dairy production in Siltie Zone, Southern Ethiopia, applying multivariate analysis approaches
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - This study aims to categorize smallholder dairy farming systems through multivariate analysis. Nonlinear categorical principal component analysis (NLPCA) was used to lessen 35 variables into 4 sets of uncorrelated components. These four categories are environment-genetic interaction, management, hygiene, and genetic-related factors. Besides, within the two-step cluster analysis, a variable cluster membership was created that identified which family belonged to which cluster. For comparison purpose, hierarchical cluster analysis was used. A two-step cluster analysis results showed that most farms (41.50% and 31.90% in peri-urban and urban areas, respectively, had been in cluster 1 at the same time as most farms (66.70%) of urban areas had been in cluster 2. Overall, most (31.00% and 34.00%) of farms have been in clusters 1 and 2, respectively. Most farms in peri-urban areas had been challenged with scarcity of feed, mastitis, and animal sickness than farms within the urban and rural farming systems. Forming farmer groups as a cooperative to supply offerings together with feed processing devices, artificial insemination, and health services is usually recommended to triumph over such hassle. In addition, on account that it is primarily based on a couple of criteria, the category system evolved in this study depicts a lot better dairy farming systems with admiration to the variety of the components and the relative contribution of each component to dairy farming than do the single-criterion classifications. Hence, the results of such classifications should be seen as a start line from which to efficiently compare the modern extension system and eventually design the high-quality-fit extension models for a heterogeneous populace of smallholder dairy farmers.

TI  - Breeding programs for smallholder sheep farming systems: I. Evaluation of alternative designs of breeding schemes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND GENETICS
AB  - Village- and central nucleus-based schemes were simulated and evaluated for their relative bio-economic efficiencies, using Ethiopia's Menz sheep as example. The schemes were: village-based 2-tier (Scheme-1) and 1-tier (Scheme-2) cooperative village breeding schemes, dispersed village-based nuclei scheme (Scheme-3), conventional 2-tier central nucleus-based scheme (Scheme-4), and schemes linking a central nucleus and village multiplier nuclei with selection in central nucleus (Scheme-5) or in both central and village nuclei (Scheme-6). Among village-based schemes, Scheme-1 gave the highest genetic progress, while Scheme-2 was economically the most efficient with genetic gain in the breeding objective of Birr 5.6 and a profit of Birr 37.2/ewe/year. The central nucleus schemes were more efficient than the village schemes. Scheme-4 was the most efficient with genetic gain in the breeding objective of Birr 13.5 and a profit of Birr 71.2, but is operationally more difficult as it requires a very large central nucleus. The choice between village and central nucleus-based schemes would depend on local conditions (availability of infrastructure, logistics and technical knowhow and support). Linking central nucleus with village-based nuclei (Scheme-6) would be a feasible option to overcome the operational difficulties of the conventional central nucleus scheme. If a village-based breeding program is envisaged as should be the 1st step in most low-input systems, then Scheme-2 is the most efficient. To scale out to an entire Menz breed level, Scheme-3 would be recommended.

TI  - Effect of Government Intervention and Market Incentives on Farmer Organic Fertilizer Application Behavior and Agricultural Emission Reduction
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW
AB  - Substituting organic fertilizer for chemical fertilizer is widely viewed as an effective path to promoting sustainable agricultural development amidst the imminent threat of climate change. This paper investigates the effect of government intervention and market incentives on farmers' organic fertilizer application behavior (FOFAB), using survey data from Xinjiang, China. The results show that, first, three sub-dimensional variables of government intervention, namely policy publicity, fiscal subsidies, and regulation constraints, all have a significantly positive impact on FOFAB, and that fiscal subsidy ranks first in terms of influencing the degree of the effect. Second, there is a mediating effect of market incentives on the relationship between government intervention and FOFAB via three paths, namely the market price of organic fertilizer, the cost of applying organic fertilizer, and market demand for organic food. The most significant mechanism is that fiscal subsidies have a positive influence on FOFAB by activating market demand for organic food, reducing the cost of applying organic fertilizer, and promoting the market price of organic food. In addition, the variables of family endowments have a steady and significant effect on FOFAB. Social networks did not exert a positive effect on FOFAB. Therefore, the local government should incentivize governmental intervention measures to improve the market competition mechanism, encourage more farmers to join agricultural cooperatives, and expand social networks to facilitate FOFAB.

TI  - The effect of collective forestland tenure reform in China: Does land parcelization reduce forest management intensity?
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST ECONOMICS
AB  - China implemented a new round of collective forestland tenure reform during 2003-2013. In this reform, forestland owned by villages or township collective organizations were divided into a great number of small plots and allocated to member households of the collectives. A widespread concern about the reform is that parcelization of forestland might limit farmers' incentives to invest in forest management. This paper examines the factors affecting farmers' investment in forest management using household data collected in four provinces in 2010. The results show that the intensity of a household's investment in forest management is negatively affected by its nonfarm income and the average size of forest plots, but positively affected by the easiness in obtaining loan and the technical assistance the household receives. We argue that the counterintuitive effect of nonfarm income on investment intensity is due to the increasing marginal cost of own labor input. The effects of forest plot size and easiness in obtaining loan suggest that households have limited amount of capital to invest in forest management. Because of this constraint, parcelization of forestland resulted from the recent reform has not yet caused any reduction of the intensity of investment in forest management.

TI  - The micro administrative mechanism of land reallocation in land consolidation: A perspective from collective action
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The implementation of land reallocation is stagnant in China for many reasons, among which the non-cooperation of farmers is a critical one. Although extensive research has been conducted to promote land reallocation, it is mainly confined to macro administrative or technical aspects, leaving studies on the micro administrative mechanism still absent. This paper deeply investigates incentives of farmers to participate in land reallocation, based on which we novelly analyse the interactions among farmers under two different scenarios. The results show that the number and heterogeneity of households involved in land reallocation make significant differences on achievement of collective action, and local governors should choose their strategies according to structure of the stakeholders group. Specifically, in land consolidation projects which involve a large-size group of small households, reducing costs incurred by the endowment effect is imperative. In projects which involve a small group of heterogeneous households, strategy that combines granting priority to small households in choosing land and constructing a farmland relative value system helps to reach agreements among households. In addition, an illustrative case study of Pengze project in Jiangxi province shows that introduction of land transfer in land consolidation projects can change structure of the stakeholders group, thereby facilitating implementation of land reallocation. Hence, a combination of land transfer and land consolidation projects can be a good solution to the stagnation of land reallocation.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE IN RURAL ECONOMIC ORGANISATIONS
T2  - REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE ORGANIZACIONES
AB  - Organizational performance has been approached from numerous perspectives. Because performance has multiple components or dimensions, selection of those components will depend on the type and interests of the organization to be evaluated. Studies available in Mexico on the performance of economic organizations in rural areas provide only a general appraisal of their financial status and do not reflect the value partners receive for remaining organized. The aims of this article are to generate a new quantitative perspective for measuring economic performance and to analyze the factors associated with it. Our universe of study were organizations of agricultural and livestock producers located in the Mexican state of Guanajuato that participate in the "Innovative Marketing" program. Our methodology involved calculating the Value Added by the Organization (VAO) as a measure of performance, for which descriptive analysis, correlation analysis (Pearson and Kendall's Tau-b), linear regression and one-factor ANOVA were conducted. Our results showed that VAO reflects the profits partners receive by being organized and that the number of services offered by the organization and the professionalization of the technical structure are important associated factors for generating VAO.

TI  - Will the Adoption of Early Fertigation Techniques Hinder Famers' Technology Renewal? Evidence from Fresh Growers in Shaanxi, China
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Fertigation technology is key to solve water pollution and inefficient fertilizer use. However, some early techniques cannot adapt to the current situation of labor shortages and large-scale planting. Therefore, it is necessary to consider farmers' willingness to adopt more adaptive techniques. Specifically, we focus on whether early technology adoption will hinder technology renewal and whether the factors affecting the adoption of early and latest techniques are consistent. Through theoretical analysis and a survey, we find that farmers' endowments such as income and labor force only affect the adoption intentions to the high-cost technique (Intelligent Irrigation Control System), but not early techniques (Venturi injector and Differential pressure tank), while farmers' information processing ability and information acquisition channels affect both. Finally, the results of Propensity Score Matching show that early technology adoption will not become an obstacle to technology renewal.

TI  - Determinants of Member Participation in Activities of Multipurpose Primary Cooperatives: The Case of Kindo Koysha District, Southern Ethiopia
T2  - ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - In the modern global economy, members' active participation is critical to the successful implementation of cooperative groups' planned activities. The objectives of this study were to investigate the participation of cooperative members in MPPCs activities and to determine the factors that influence the participation of members in multipurpose cooperatives in the Kindo Koysha district. The study location was chosen for this purpose because no prior in-depth research had been conducted. The multipurpose primary cooperatives were chosen from among the four in the study area based on agro-ecological classifications such as high land, medium land, and low land. The target population of 752 people (M = 594 and F = 158) was chosen using a simple random sample technique with a probability proportional to the size sampling technique (PPS), whereas 106 sample respondents (M = 84 and F = 22) were chosen using (Yamane) implified formula. Primary data were collected using the interview schedule supplied to sample respondents, focus group discussion checklists, and key informant interviews. Secondary data were also collected from several public and unpublished sources. The level of participation in multipurpose cooperatives was measured by computing the participation index score value. The participation of members has been classified as low, medium, or high based on the mean value, which is 40 (37.5%), 50 (47.2%), and 16 (15.1%), respectively. The ordered logit model was utilized for data analysis, and percentages, mean differences, one-way ANOVA, Spearman correlation, and the chi-square test were performed. According to the findings, education level, family size, total annual income, shareholding amount, access to saving and credit, distance from the cooperative service center, access to and utilization of agricultural inputs, services rendered by MPPCs, perceived challenges of MPPCs that discourage membership, and perceived members satisfaction with cooperative services are the determinant factors that affect the level of membership participation. Continuous education and training, encouraging the issue of family planning, diversification of income-generating schemes, encouraging existing members to buy additional shares, creating the best opportunity for saving and credit, need-based supply of agricultural inputs, resolving the internal and external constraints of multipurpose cooperatives, and strengthening the MPPCs through research-based technical support and follow-up are some of the suggested implications.

TI  - Challenges faced by smallholders in strawberry production in the Federal District, Brazil
T2  - HORTICULTURA BRASILEIRA
AB  - In this article, I had highlighted the results of a survey carried out in 2009 on the situation and difficulties faced by strawberry growers, characterized as smallholders, in the Federal District (DF), Brazil. In addition, I discuss some alternatives to mitigate these problems. The most cited challenges identified by smallholders were, in order of importance: (1) incidence of pests and diseases; (2) strawberry plantlet acquisition; (3) packing costs; (4) need of intensive labor; and (5) high production costs. Based on these information, some possible measures to improve the social and economic status of the smallholders involved in the strawberry production in DF are: (a) local production of plantlets, with sanitary quality and affordable costs, to reduce the dependence on other Brazilian States; (b) a more intensive use of the several public and private universities, science and technology institutions and rural extension services available in DF to support the sector; (c) creation of an association or cooperative to scale up production, access distinct market niches and strengthen the political influence of the sector; (d) improve the postharvest handling system by adopting modern packing materials and refrigeration; (e) adopt modern traceability tools, so as to increase the local strawberry added value and, therefore, access more demanding markets; (f) implement and join the "Strawberry Integrated Production Program (PIMo)", officially launched by the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply in 2006; (g) survey the local strawberry market and consumer demands to develop a strategic marketing plan to serve the distinct market segments. The increasing consumers' demand for fruit quality and certified and residue free products will surely push the strawberry production system in DF into a scenario of efficiency and excellence.

TI  - Evidence on the Incentive Properties of Share Contracts
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAW & ECONOMICS
AB  - Ever since Adam Smith, share contracts have been condemned for their lack of incentives. Sharecropping tenants face incentives to undersupply productive inputs since they receive only a fraction of the marginal revenue. The empirical literature reports that lands under sharecropping are indeed less productive and employ inputs less intensively than those operated by owners. This paper shows that (1) sharecropping and fixed-rent tenancy are both associated with low-quality lands, (2) plots under sharecropping and fixed rent present (on average) the same unconditional productivity, (3) controlling for observed land quality and input use, their average productivities are also identical to those of owner-operated plots, and (4) the input choices satisfy the same profit maximization conditions for all land contracts. These results challenge the conventional wisdom connecting sharecropping to incentive distortions. They support an alternative view that farmers optimally employ more input resources into good-quality lands, which are typically managed by owners.

TI  - Land acquisition for industrialization and compensation of displaced farmers
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper addresses the question of how farmers displaced by acquisition of agricultural land for the purpose of industrialization ought to be compensated. Prior to acquisition, the farmers are leasing in land from a private owner or local government with a legally mandated sharecropping contract. Compensation rules affect the decision of the landlord to sell the land ex post to an industrial developer, and ex ante incentives of tenants and landlord to make specific investments in agricultural productivity. Efficiency considerations are shown to require farmers be over-compensated in the event of conversion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of rural transport infrastructure on the intensification of purchased input use for major food crop production: the case of smallholder farmers in Horro Guduru Wollega Zone, Western Ethiopia
T2  - AUC GEOGRAPHICA
AB  - This paper examines the effect of rural transport on smallholder farmers' purchased input use. A random sample of 500 respondents was selected and relevant data was collected. Descriptive, correlation, and regression statistics were used to analyze the data. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed that farmers' purchased input use was found to be significantly and negatively related to distance to major market, distance to all weather road, distance to farm plot, transport cost, and size of land holding. In contrast, farmers' purchased input use was found to be significantly and positively related to family size, off farm income, membership in a cooperative, being in Horro district, having animal cart, and access to good road. Further, the results of hierarchical multiple regression showed that approximately 82% of the total variation in purchased input use can be explained by the linear combination of all independent variables. Furthermore, the result showed that rural transport infrastructure-related variables, as a set, contributed 13.3% to the prediction of farmers' purchased input use over and above the remaining predictors. The results suggest that improving the rural road infrastructure and access to rural transportation services is vital in encouraging farmers' purchased input use.

TI  - Cultural multi-level selection and biological market theory explain the coupled dynamics of labor exchange cooperation and social support
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB  - Smallholders rely on labor exchange and social support networks; however, little is known about the cooperative dynamics of these interlinked systems. Whereas cultural multi-level selection (CLMS) predicts group membership and changes in the dominant level of selection modulates cooperation, biological market theory (BMT) posits market size fluctuations affect cooperation. We assess these predictions by examining two dimensions of labor exchange, competitive helping and labor reciprocity, and their downstream impacts on social support in a Dominican community between 2007 and 2010. First, we analyze within-community labor organization. Next, we analyze how international regulatory change and the 2008-2009 World Trade Collapse affected local labor organization and its impacts on competitive helping and labor reciprocity. Finally, we show how labor dynamics affected social support. Analyses reveal that (1) village labor initially involved two levels (labor contracting and labor exchange) and the presence of a structured group who maintained higher rates of reciprocal labor relative to non-group members; (2) changes in the international commodities market reduced labor contracting, the size of the labor exchange market, and the dominant level of selection, resulting in less competitive helping, lower rates of reciprocity for group members, and more cliquish social support; and (3) as the global market for bay oil ameliorated, labor organization shifted back to a pre-recession structure, resulting in a larger labor market with more competitive helping and higher rates of reciprocity amongst group members. We highlight the utility of an integrated CMLS and BMT framework for analyzing cooperative dynamics and socio-economic systems sustainability.

TI  - The falling production of mexican cacao analyzed through the lens of Mincerian earnings function in the context of social capital of smallholders
T2  - REVISTA DE LA FACULTAD DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
AB  - The cacao belongs to most important agricultural crops worldwide, in recent decades facing increasing demand as well as falling production capacity. The dramatically fall of production of cacao in Mexican agriculture, where it was first domesticated, is becoming a serious concern for diversity of local production, as local producers are substituting cacao plantations with more rentable crops thus giving away a rich genetic as well as agricultural legacy that could under adequate conditions provide a source of income for large region while maintaining the natural diversity. The paper tries to find the answer in studying the social capital of cacao producers of Tabasco region, coming to the conclusion that it is collective action and social capital led production set of practices that is crucial for the re-installment and prosperity of the plantations, rather than a single motive such as the recent invasion of Moniliophthora roreri fungus.

TI  - Influence of a new agricultural technology extension mode on farmers' technology adoption behavior in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - With the development of Internet information technology and portable mobile terminals, a new agricultural technology extension mode has emerged that uses new media such as WeChat public accounts and apps. However, empirical studies on the effectiveness of the new agricultural technology extension mode have not been reported. To compensate for the shortage of existing research, this article uses survey data from 759 peasant households in Shandong Province and Henan Province to measure soil fertilizer technology, water-saving irrigation techniques and the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests through green technology. A score matching method is used to explore new agricultural technology extension modes for farmers' direct effects and spillover effects from technology adoption behavior as well as distribution effects. A robustness inspection instrumental variable method is used to identify the effectiveness of the new agricultural technology extension mode and provide extensive information to evaluate the effectiveness of the analytical framework. The study finds that the new agricultural technology extension mode improves the technology adoption level of farmers to a certain extent with a partial spillover effect, and farmers of different ages and with different sizes of farmland benefit differently. When guiding farmers to use the new agricultural technology extension mode, it is important to consider the information diffusion among farmers who have already adopted this mode and to disseminate this information to elderly and small-scale farmers.

TI  - SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION PRACTICES AMONG THE INDEPENDENT OIL PALM SMALLHOLDERS IN BETONG AND SARATOK, SARAWAK, MALAYSIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF OIL PALM RESEARCH
AB  - Soil and water conservation (SWC) practices which are included in the Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) for oil palm production are essential to be adopted by oil palm growers in order to maintain the quality of natural resources and adhere to the environmental conservation. At present, no scientific study has been carried out to indicate the level of knowledge and adoption of SWC among the independent oil palm smallholders (NH). This study was aimed to evaluate the knowledge and current adoption of SWC among members of the Saratok Sustainable Oil Palm Growers Cooperative. The quantitative and qualitative research methods applied to evaluate the level of SWC knowledge and adoption by oil palm smallholders were based on the checklist in the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO). ?he data collected were via in-situ observation and face-to-face interviews with respondents. The results of the study indicated that the level of smallholders' knowledge on SWC practices is high, however, the adoption level is still low. Recommendations based on the research affirmed that incentive/assistance scheme from the government is necessary to help and encourage ISH and the MSPO certification becomes mandatory for the cooperatives to ensure that the SWC is adopted by ISH for their long-term benefit.

TI  - Is the Formalization of Collective Tenure Rights Supporting Sustainable Indigenous Livelihoods? Insights from Comunidades Nativas in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS
AB  - After decades of activism by Indigenous Peoples and their allies, the need to formalize Indigenous land rights has received increasing global attention as a strategy to address climate change. Research has highlighted the compatibility between community forest management regimes and carbon sequestration, reiterating the essential role that securing Indigenous land tenure must play in forest-based climate change mitigation strategies. Based on research conducted in six Indigenous Comunidades Nativas with formal collective titles in Peruvian Amazonia, this article argues that titling alone is not enough to ensure that Indigenous Peoples are supported and enabled to access their recognized rights and play a central role in addressing the climate crisis. Indigenous Awajun and Ashaninka informants discussed challenges with accessing suitable livelihoods, excessive restrictions on timber harvest, land conflicts with smallholder migrant farmers and extractive concessions, unclear conflict resolution mechanisms, and policies that assume a communal governance model that differs from actual Indigenous leadership roles and institutions. All of these challenges put pressure on community members, creating incentives for unsustainable land and resource use, and undermining their abilities to protect their forests. Although Peru has included Comunidades Nativas and other co-managed areas in the mitigation actions toward its Nationally Determined Contribution to the Paris Agreement, it must re-examine its titling reforms, and the way that Comunidades' land and resource access is regulated and weakened. This will allow for titling in practice to live up to its promise in theory as a strategy for promoting equity and mitigating climate change.

TI  - Chamaedorea Palm Frond Commercialization and Certification Considered from a Smallholder Livelihood System Perspective
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - Chamaedorea palm frond (xate) certification has been broadly promoted throughout Mesoamerica as a means to foster the integration of forest conservation and economic development. This study examined the feasibility of xate commercialization and certification at the scale of the extractor livelihood system in an ejido in the Chinantla region of Oaxaca, Mexico. Ethnographic methods were used to collect livelihood system data. These data were used to develop an ethnographic linear program (ELP) model of extractor households to analyze the effects of palm frond management and marketing scenarios on their livelihoods. Three necessary conditions for the feasibility of certification were hypothesized: two related to extractor livelihoods and another related to market fluidity. Livelihood outcomes supported the notion that resource sustainability and economic development are not mutually exclusive, and provided support for xate certification as an intervention oriented toward the integration of these objectives. In contrast, the model revealed an unfavorable discrepancy between xate supply and the level of demand expressed by an interested buyer. This shortfall represented a substantial obstacle to the feasibility of xate certification in the community. Low demand fulfillment suggested that xate certification ultimately represents an infeasible strategy for the community, irrespective of the observed livelihood and conservation benefits. Results highlighted the importance of understanding household objectives and market context in local decisions to pursue NTFP certification. We suggest that the community's objectives would best be served by engaging neighboring communities in a cooperative and controlled effort to augment regional supply.

TI  - Voluntary monitoring of households in waste disposal: An application of the institutional analysis and development framework
T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB  - While increasing consensus has grown around the important role of monitoring in environmental resource governance, little is known about under what conditions people would rather pay private costs to implement monitoring and punishment. Using field survey data on communities and households from four suburb areas in China, this paper employs Institutional Analysis and Development framework to empirically examine households' willingness and actual activities on waste disposal monitoring. The empirical results show that population density, community modernization, and being male significantly increase the likelihood of households supervising waste disposal while community size and heterogeneity of wealth and ethnicity seriously impede the involvement of households in waste disposal supervision. More importantly, our estimation results reveal that staffing community with full-time cadres for sanitation management suppress the enthusiasm of households in conducting waste disposal supervision, but stock of social capital and peer monitoring substantially increase the intention to supervise waste disposal and the possibility of households engaging in waste disposal supervision activities. In addition, social norms, household income, and householder age are primary predictors of the intention-behavior gap between hypothetical willingness to monitor and actual monitoring behavior. Therefore, improving community infrastructure and economic condition, reducing external intervention on community affairs, and cultivating social capital stock are important approaches to enhance public participation in environmental governance.

TI  - Breeding programmes for smallholder sheep farming systems: II. Optimization of cooperative village breeding schemes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND GENETICS
AB  - A simulation study was conducted to optimize a cooperative village-based sheep breeding scheme for Menz sheep of Ethiopia. Genetic gains and profits were estimated under nine levels of farmers' participation and three scenarios of controlled breeding achieved in the breeding programme, as well as under three cooperative flock sizes, ewe to ram mating ratios and durations of ram use for breeding. Under fully controlled breeding, that is, when there is no gene flow between participating (P) and non-participating (NP) flocks, profits ranged from Birr 36.9 at 90% of participation to Birr 21.3 at 10% of participation. However, genetic progress was not affected adversely. When there was gene flow from the NP to P flocks, profits declined from Birr 28.6 to Birr -3.7 as participation declined from 90 to 10%. Under the two-way gene flow model (i.e. when P and NP flocks are herded mixed in communal grazing areas), NP flocks benefited from the genetic gain achieved in the P flocks, but the benefits declined sharply when participation declined beyond 60%. Our results indicate that a cooperative breeding group can be established with as low as 600 breeding ewes mated at a ratio of 45 ewes to one ram, and the rams being used for breeding for a period of two years. This study showed that farmer cooperation is crucial to effect genetic improvement under smallholder low-input sheep farming systems.

AB  - The land-use change and forestry sector can be a cost-effective contributor to climate mitigation in at least three ways: providing carbon offsets through carbon sequestration in biomass and soils, reducing emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases, and producing biofuels that replace fossil fuels. The presence of carbon markets should help encourage these activities: however, most carbon trades to date have occurred in the energy sector. A major obstacle to carbon trades from land-use systems is the presence of high transaction costs of converting a carbon offset into a tradable commodity, so the prevailing market carbon prices may not provide enough incentive for adoption. This paper presents a model of the exchange of carbon offsets between a project developer and a group of landholders. The model is solved to derive project feasibility frontiers that show the minimum number of contracts necessary to make a project feasible at any given carbon price. The model is applied to two case studies (smallholder agroforestry in Indonesia and partial reforestation of family farms in Australia) under two types of contract (purchase of carbon flows and rental of carbon stocks). The paper concludes by identifying possible strategies to reduce transaction costs while maintaining project integrity. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Utilising Gliricidia sepium leaf meal as a protein substitute in cassava-based supplements to increase average daily gain of Ongole bulls and income of smallholder farmers
T2  - ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB  - Context. Formulating supplements with Gliricidia sepium leaf meal (GLM) and cassava powder to promote liveweight gain of Ongole bulls. Aims. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of using GLM as a substitute for copra meal (CM) or soybean hulls (SBH) in a concentrate containing dry cassava powder (DCP) on the average daily gain of Ongole bulls and income over feed cost. Methods. Forty Ongole bulls were allocated in a randomised block design with 10 head per treatment. The control group (R-0) was provided the current feeding system (CFS) fed ad libitum, with supplemented treatments consisting of the current feeding system fed ad libitum + 1% liveweight (on approximate DM basis)/day of three different concentrate supplement diets (R-1 , R-2 and R-3). R-1 concentrate contained 50% DCP, 25% CM and 25% SBH; R-2 was 50% DCP, 25% GLM and 25% SBH; and R3 was 50% DCP, 25% CM and 25% GLM. The bulls belonged to cooperative smallholder farmers in the Banaran and Bleberan villages, Playen Subdistrict, Gunungkidul Regency, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The experiment was performed for 12 weeks from 22 December 2018 to 16 March 2019. Key results. The average weight gain of bulls (kg/head) in the treatments R-0, R-1, R-2 and R-3 were 0.31, 0.75, 0.61 and 0.62, respectively. The income over feed cost of supplement treatments R-1 , R-2 and R-3 was double that of the control (R-0). Conclusions. It was concluded that GLM can replace the use of SBH and CM in a cassava-based supplement and increase the income of farmers in this district. Implications. Cassava powder can be combined with GLM to form a concentrate that increases the average weight gain of Ongole bulls and income of farmers.

TI  - Challenges to pre-migration interventions to prevent human trafficking: Results from a before-and-after learning assessment of training for prospective female migrants in Odisha, India
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background Awareness-raising and pre-migration training are popular strategies to prevent human trafficking. Programmatic theories assume that when prospective migrants are equipped with information about risks, they will make more-informed choices, ultimately resulting in safe migration. In 2016, India was estimated to have 8 million people in modern slavery, including those who migrate internally for work. Work in Freedom (WiF) was a community-based trafficking prevention intervention. This study evaluated WiF's pre-migration knowledge-building activities for female migrants in Odisha to prevent future labour-related exploitation. Methods Pre- and post- training questionnaires were administered to women (N = 347) who participated in a two-day pre-migration training session. Descriptive analysis and unadjusted analyses (paired t-tests, McNemar's tests, Wilcoxon signed ranks tests) examined differences in women's knowledge scores before and after training. Adjusted analyses used mixed effects models to explore whether receiving information on workers' rights or working away from home prior to the training was associated with changes in scores. Additionally, we used data from a household survey (N = 4,671) and survey of female migrants (N = 112) from a population sample in the same district to evaluate the intervention's rationale and implementation strategy. Results Female participants were on average 37.3 years-old (SD 11) and most (67.9%) had no formal education. Only 11 participants (3.2%) had previous migration experience. Most participants (90.5%) had previously received information or advice on workers' rights or working away from home. Compared to female migrants in the population, training participants were different in age, caste and religion. Awareness about migration risks, rights and collective bargaining was very low initially and remained low post-training, e.g. of 13 possible migration risks, before the training, participants named an average of 1.2 risks, which increased only slightly to 2.1 risks after the training (T(346) = -11.64, p<0.001). Changes were modest for attitudes about safe and risky migration practices, earnings and savings. Before the training, only 34 women (10.4%) considered migrating, which reduced to 25 women (7.7%) post-training (X-2= 1.88, p = 0.169)-consistent with the low prevalence (7% of households) of female migration locally. Women's attitudes remained relatively fixed about the shame associated with paid domestic work. Survey data indicated focusing on domestic work did not correspond to regional migration trends, where women migrate primarily for construction or agriculture work. Conclusion The apparent low effectiveness of the WiF short-duration migration training may be linked to the assumption that individual changes in knowledge will lead to shifts in social norms. The narrow focus on such individual-level interventions may overestimate an individual's agency. Findings indicate the importance of intervention development research to ensure activities are conducted in the right locations, target the right populations, and have relevant content. Absent intervention development research, this intervention suffered from operating in a site that had very few migrant women and a very small proportion migrating for domestic work-the focus of the training.
   To promote better development investments, interventions should be informed by local evidence and subjected to rigorous theory-based evaluation to ensure interventions achieve the most robust design to foster safe labour migration for women.

TI  - Participation in the world's first clean development mechanism forest project: The role of property rights, social capital and contractual rules
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) forest projects are perceived as an attractive way to both help mitigate climate change and transfer income to rural poor. However, to engender participation of small-scale producers, a CDM forest project must offer sufficient incentives, while minimizing their costs of participation, all the while respecting the need for additionality. Property rights, social capital and contractual rules are critical in the success of CDM forest projects. In this paper, we ask what factors affect participation in the world's first CDM project, established in Guangxi Province. China. Using village-level surveys, we find that although the project facilitates participation through carbon pooling and a share-holding system, much of the project land remains unforested. We find that the primary reasons for the unforested regions are constrained contractual rules, property rights allocation disputes and low levels of social capital in some villages.

TI  - The influence of uncertainty on the choice of business relationships: The case of vegetable farmers in China
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - Although uncertainly is a common feature of agricultural markets, we know little about the effect of uncertainty on farmers' choice of business relationships. This paper distinguishes production uncertainty, environmental uncertainty, and behavioral uncertainty in examining four kinds of business relationships of Chinese vegetable farmers: market exchange, cooperative membership without marketing transaction, cooperative membership with marketing transaction, and contract farming. We applied a multinomial logit model to data collected among 413 farmers in Hebei and Zhejiang provinces. The results suggested that all three types of uncertainty significantly affect the business relationships chosen by vegetable farmers. In particular, it was found that as production uncertainty increases, farmers prefer contract farming and both cooperative membership with and without marketing transaction over market exchange; while as behavioral uncertainty increases, farmers are less likely to be involved in contract farming. Environmental uncertainty does not affect the likelihood that farmers choose market exchange or contract farming, while mixed results are obtained for its effects on cooperative membership with and without marketing transaction.

TI  - Analysis of Influencing Factors and Income Effect of Heterogeneous Agricultural Households' Forestland Transfer
T2  - LAND
AB  - After the collective forest tenure reform, the forestland transfer behavior choices did not reach the policy expectations. In order to explore the factors influencing the behavior of farmers' forestland transfer and the income effect of forestland transfer, this paper constructs a binary logistic regression model and a propensity score matching (PSM) model and uses the data obtained from a questionnaire survey of 500 farmers from 10 counties in Liaoning Province for quantitative analysis. Considering the heterogeneity, agricultural households are divided into three categories, namely, pure agricultural households, part-time agricultural households and non-agricultural households. The study found that the influencing factors of different types of agricultural households' forestland transfer behavior choices were not exactly the same and the degree of influence by the same variable was also different. Forestland transfer can effectively promote the increase of agricultural and forestry income and total household income of pure agricultural households, part-time agricultural households and non-agricultural households, among which the promotion effect on pure agricultural households is the largest.

TI  - Diagnosis of management of bacterial wilt and late blight in potato in Ethiopia: A systems thinking perspective
T2  - NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Potato is one of the most important food crops for smallholder farmers in the Ethiopian highlands. Diseases, particularly bacterial wilt (caused by Ralstonia solanacearum) and late blight (caused by Phytophthora infestans), are among the major constraints of potato production, despite continuous efforts to control them. Bacterial wilt and late blight are complex problems with multiple technical and institutional features, involving multiple actors with different perceptions and understanding, not only of the problem but also of possible solutions. Appreciating such complexity, this study adopted a systems thinking perspective. It aimed to explore actors' understanding of the complex problem situation and its implication for the management of the diseases at a collective level. Using a multi-stakeholder workshop and in-depth interviews, a qualitative study was conducted with actors that are directly or indirectly involved in the management of the two diseases. Results showed that actors essentially overlooked key systemic problems in the management of the two diseases. This is mainly reflected in actors' tendency to give event-level responses, shift responsibilities and engage in a mutual blaming to the problem of bacterial wilt and late blight. Lack of a preventive disease management culture, limited recognition of interdependencies among activities of actors, power inequalities, and top-down and linear approaches in information and knowledge sharing are identified as key structural problems that are underrated by the actors. We contend that the most appropriate way forward towards the management of both diseases is designing and implementing management strategies that, on the one hand, are preventive of disease epidemics, and, on the other hand, foster horizontal information sharing, learning and collective action among the local actors in the system. Digital platforms, particularly mobile-based technologies, can play a role in catalyzing new forms of information sharing, broader learning, and collaboration among farmers and local actors.

TI  - Collective action for ecosystem services in the Paraiba Valley from Sao Paulo state, Brazil: a multilevel panorama
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
AB  - Land use and management decisions in rural areas ultimately lead either to the erosion or to conservation of natural resources and ecosystem services on which agricultural production and tourism depend. The degradation of these resources may cause shocks and disturbances as the flood from 2010 in Sao Luiz do Paraitinga, in the state of Sao Paulo, that highlights the need to adopt new practices and development of trajectories. This work is aimed at providing the panorama of projects focusing on conserving and restoring the ecosystem services that entails the Chapeu River Watershed, in the rural area of Sao Luiz do Paraitinga, between 2013 and 2017. We observed 16 technical and 15 community meetings, performed 9 non-structured interviews and bibliographic research. Data were coded, categorized, and triangulated. We found that different projects were implemented by governmental agencies and local non-governmental organizations focusing on managing and restoring ecosystem services (e.g., erosion control, maintenance of native species, water). Income generation by local smallholders was also considered. Stakeholder networks for collective action were formed and enabled the implementation of the projects, by connecting governmental agencies, organizations, and individuals from different institutional levels. Individual and community-based environmental initiatives were also developed and focused mainly on cultural ecosystem services, despite being more limited in space and time. Half of them were developed by a group of rural inhabitants. Co-occurring government-led projects and community-based initiatives characterized local-level management of ecosystem services. We discuss that the alignment between the projects and initiatives, as well as the connections among individuals working on different levels (in a local - regional perspective) may contribute to increase the synergy among actions that favor the conservation of ecosystem services in the local level.

TI  - A theory of sharecropping: The role of price behavior and imperfect competition
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - This paper proposes a theory of sharecropping on the basis of price behavior in agriculture and imperfectly competitive nature of rural product markets. First we show the superiority of sharecropping over fixed rental contracts in a benchmark landlord-tenant model with seasonal variation of price, where the tenant receives a low price for his output while the landlord can sell his output at a higher price. Then we consider more general interlinked contracts to show that there are multiple optimal contracts. Finally we incorporate imperfect competition in the product market by assuming that a third agent (called the epsilon-agent) may emerge to compete with the landlord as a buyer of the tenant's output. It is shown that (i) the presence of this competing agent generates a Pareto-improving subset of share contracts out of the multiple contracts and (ii) the unique contract that is robust to the emergence of the epsilon-agent results in sharecropping.

TI  - The green revolution as a process of global circulation: plants, people and practices
T2  - HISTORIA AGRARIA
AB  - The "Green Revolution" (GR) is often portrayed as a humanitarian development programme in which crop varieties, cultivation practices and expertise were transferred essentially from global North to South. In this paper, however, I argue that this picture is seriously misleading for two reasons. First, it overlooks the significance of circulation between these regions. Several of the innovations central to the GR's high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice, for example, originated in the global South before being taken up by northern breeders, while important practices and experts were transferred between countries within the global South. Moreover some of the approaches to increasing smallholder productivity which emerged from the 1970s can be traced to encounters between northern experts and southern farmers dating from the colonial period. In view of these patterns of circulation, the GR is more accurately depicted as a collective undertaking than as a "heroic" achievement of the North. Second, the tendency to represent the GR and development aid more generally as a "gift" from the benevolent North to the needy South ignores the very substantial economic gains which have accrued to northern agriculture and industry by virtue of GR research nominally intended to benefit the South.

TI  - Exploring synergies and trade-offs among the sustainable development goals: collective action and adaptive capacity in marginal mountainous areas of India
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB  - Global environmental change (GEC) threatens to undermine the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Smallholders in marginal mountainous areas (MMA) are particularly vulnerable due to precarious livelihoods in challenging environments. Acting collectively can enable and constrain the ability of smallholders to adapt to GEC. The objectives of this paper are: (i) identify collective actions in four MMA of the central Indian Himalaya Region, each with differing institutional contexts; (ii) assess the adaptive capacity of each village by measuring livelihood capital assets, diversity, and sustainable land management practices. Engaging with adaptive capacity and collective action literatures, we identify three broad approaches to adaptive capacity relating to the SDGs: natural hazard mitigation (SDG 13), social vulnerability (SDG 1, 2 and 5), and social-ecological resilience (SDG 15). We then develop a conceptual framework to understand the institutional context and identify SDG synergies and trade-offs. Adopting a mixed method approach, we analyse the relationships between collective action and the adaptive capacity of each village, the sites where apparent trade-offs and synergies among SDGs occur. Results illustrate each village has unique socio-environmental characteristics, implying distinct development challenges, vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities exist. Subsequently, specific SDG synergies and trade-offs occur even within MMA, and it is therefore crucial that institutions facilitate locally appropriate collective actions in order to achieve the SDGs. We suggest that co-production in the identification, prioritisation and potential solutions to the distinct challenges facing MMA can increase understandings of the specific dynamics and feedbacks necessary to achieve the SDGs in the context of GEC.
