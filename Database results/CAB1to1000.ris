TI  - Is a 10-sow unit economically sustainable? A profitability assessment of productivity amongst small-holder pig farmers, Mpumalanga, South Africa
T2  - ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB  - The majority of small-holder pig farmers in Mpumalanga had between 1- and 10-sow herds. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the current government agricultural intervention (supply of 10 sows and a boar) in terms of technical and economic feasibilities and ascertain whether the small-scale pig value chain system alleviates poverty. Data were obtained from 220 randomly selected small-holder pig farmers using a semi-structured questionnaire. The results showed that 58% farrowed <= 10 piglets/born/sow/litter, 44.2% practiced no weaning method and many fed swill and leftovers alone (41.6%). Pair-wise association revealed that the feeding of commercial feeds had a relationship with pigs in relatively good to very good body condition. Pigs in poor body condition were positively correlated with the feeding of swill alone. The economic models for the 10-sow unit proved that pig farming is unprofitable if the current management and feeding systems that operate in the commercial industry are utilised. However, only through a combination of cooperative systems, benefits of economies of scale, reduction of preweaning mortalities and structured government inputs can pig production be profitable at this scale of production.

TI  - Analysis of agribusiness value chains servicing small-holder dairy farming communities in Punjab, Pakistan: three case studies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - The agriculture sector in Pakistan, as in most developing countries, is dominated by smallholder producers. Pakistan has the world's third largest dairy industry, and milk is efficiently collected and distributed chiefly by informal value chains that market the raw product with minimal cool chain infrastructure. Formal processors have a small market share of 5%. Interview data from farmers, milk collectors and consumers from three rural-urban case study value chains were analysed to study opportunities and challenges faced by the dairy industry. Compositional analysis of milk samples (n=84) collected along these chains identified the fact that in Pakistan informal milk chains provide a cheaper source of calories for the final consumer than industrialised milk chains (USD 0.12 compared USD 0.15 per 100 calories). These three chains created an estimated 4,872 jobs from farm to market and provided access to interest-free credit for the farmers. The existing government price setting mechanism at the retail end and collusion by large processors to set farm gate prices provided significant limitations to the profitability of small-holder farms providing the product. The absence of quality and quantity standards, amid the exchange of huge numbers of small volumes of milk along these chains, are major impediments to industry growth.

TI  - Global private regulation and value-chain restructuring in Indonesian smallholder coffee systems
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Consumer concerns over the environmental and social conditions of coffee production have led to the proliferation of sustainability codes, certification schemes, and labeling claims in the sector. This paper addresses how the global private regulation of ethical and environmental standards is having several implications for value chain structures and institutions in the small-holder coffee systems of Indonesia. Global private regulation is driving structural changes in modes of farmer organization, trader-farmer relationships, and is resulting in the increased upstream penetration of multinational trading companies into coffee-producing areas across Indonesia. An unintended consequence of these changes in the future may be to increase transaction costs along the value chain and to exert an overall downward pressure on farm-gate prices.

TI  - The cluster panacea?: Questioning the role of cooperative shrimp aquaculture in Vietnam
T2  - AQUACULTURE
AB  - This paper analyses the role of 'clustering' as a form of cooperative production to improve the environmental performance of shrimp farmers and facilitating them to upgrade their position in the global value chain. Comparing intensive and extensive shrimp farmer clusters in Ca Mau province, Vietnam, we explore how this form of cooperative production can enable small-holders to upgrade both functional and relational dimensions of production to meet new requirements for participation in the global shrimp value chain. The results show that by facilitating horizontal coordination between producers clusters can improve the management capacity of both intensive and extensive producers for meeting international production standards. However, the success of clusters also depends on the type and strength of vertical coordination with other actors along the value chain for both the provision of inputs and marketing of outputs. The paper concludes that for improved extensive shrimp farmer clusters to take further advantage of production-oriented quality standards the Vietnamese government needs to play a greater role in the development of production infrastructure and create a legal framework for private sector-led cluster formation.

TI  - Draught animal power utilization in small holder farms - A case study of Ringim Local Government Area of Jigawa State, Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - A survey on draught animal power utilization in small holder farms was conducted during the 2004/2005 farming season in Ringim Local Government Area of Jigawa State, Nigeria. A purposive sampling technique was utilized where all the 150 household heads that owned and used draught animals were sampled. Structured questionnaires were developed and used for data collection. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics of frequencies, percentages and mean. The results showed that about 60% of the respondents within the age group of 20 to 41 years took to farming as their main occupation. All the respondents were males with a large proportion (93.33%) operating mainly at the small-scale land holding level. The White Fulani (Bunaji) bulls were the popular breed of cattle used by the respondents for animal traction. Most of the respondents (98%) trained their animals for a period of 6-7 weeks before using them fully for farm operations. Feeding of animals was sub-optimal mainly on free range without concentrate during the rainy season and crop residues with or without concentrate during the dry season. About 76.67% of the respondents found draught animal farming not profitable. Major constraints faced by farmers that hindered profitability of animal draught farming include non-availability of tractor implement, cost of maintenance, lack of capital, inadequate feed supplement and poor extension contacts. The study showed that draught animal power utilization could be profitable and enhanced in small holder farms if adequate attention is paid to tackle the identified constraints through effective extension contacts, organization of functional cooperatives to facilitate credit access and availability of traction spare parts at affordable prices to the fanners.

TI  - Do benefits of expanded midstream activities in crop value chains accrue to smallholder farmers? Evidence from Zambia
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The rapid expansion of food supply chains across Africa has created huge market opportunities for farm-ers. In particular, the rise of numerous enterprises engaged in food processing and trading in the 'mid-stream' of value chains is promising. Compared to large enterprises using formal contracts, midstream enterprises not using contracts are considered more accessible to small-scale farmers. However, the extent to which economic benefits of the recent expansion of these non-contract opportunities in Africa is inclusive of smallholder farmers is uncertain and largely unexplored. This is critical for the global debate on poverty and sustainable economic development as the share of agricultural land under small -holder farmers, who constitute a significant proportion of the world's poor is still rising. This paper con-tributes to this thin literature with evidence from Zambia, where a growing demand for meat has stimulated growth of the soybean industry. We use nationally-representative panel survey data from Zambia to explore the welfare effects of smallholder engagement with soybean traders and processors in non-contractual arrangements. The analysis uses fixed effects and instrumental variables estimation techniques to address the endogeneity of the smallholder decision to sell to large-scale traders and pro-cessors. We find significant positive crop income effects of selling to soybean large-scale traders and pro-cessors on all smallholders. However, the observed effects only translate into higher total household incomes and poverty reduction for medium-scale smallholders (operating 5 ha-20 ha) but not for small-scale smallholders operating less than five hectares. The positive crop income effects are mainly driven by the opportunity to sell more although small-scale smallholders receive a price premium from selling to large buyers. These results suggest that the recent expansion of the soybean industry in Zambia is benefiting smallholder farmers but not necessarily enough to move the smallest of these farmers out of poverty.

TI  - Knowledge, perceptions and effects of Ebola virus disease outbreak on the pig value chain in the agro-pastoralist district of Luwero, Central Uganda
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreaks have a significant impact on the health and wellbeing, and livelihoods of communities. EVD response interventions particularly affect the food value chain, and income security of pig farmers in agro-pastoral communities. Despite the enormous effort of EVD response interventions, there is paucity of information towards EVD among those involved in the pig value chain, as well as the effect of EVD outbreaks on the pig value chain. This study therefore, assessed the knowledge, perceptions on the occurrence of Ebola and its effects on the pig value chain in the agro-pastoral district of Luweero, Central Uganda. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted in two parishes of Ssambwe and Ngalonkulu, Luwero district. A total of 229 respondents were included in the study. Structured questionnaires, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were conducted to collect data. Quantitative data was analysed using SPSS version 22 while qualitative data was analysed using thematic content analysis. Results Of the 229 respondents, 95.6% could recall the occurrence of the last EVD outbreak in their locality. About 24.5% associated EVD with touching pigs or eating pork. Regarding knowledge, 194 (84.7%) correctly associated EVD with handling Ebola infected persons, 191 (83.4%) with migration of people from endemic areas, 148 (64.9%) eating monkey meat, 127 (55.5%) with eating bats, and 198 (64.9%) with conducting public meetings where there is an Ebola infected person. Out of 142 farmers, 55 (38.7%) believed that Ebola outbreaks affected demand and sale of pigs. The EVD outbreak significantly led to a reduction in the average number of pigs sold (P = 0.001), the average number of pigs bought by traders (P = 0.04), and the number of pigs sold/ slaughtered by butcher men at pork eating places (P = 0.03). Conclusion This study showed that EVD outbreak negatively affected the pig value chain i.e., the demand and supply of pigs and pork. Therefore, there is need to sensitize the stakeholders in the pig value chain on EVD in order to minimize the negative economic impacts associated with EVD outbreaks.

TI  - Agri-food system dynamics of small-holder hill farming communities of Uttarakhand in north-western India: socio-economic and policy considerations for sustainable development
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - The small-scale ecological farming methods of Uttarakhand hills are key to ensuring resilience to climate change as these are based on enhancing diversity, thereby increasing options to respond to climate instability. Beside eco-nutrition, local community-level economic incentives are also considered important for sustainability of traditional hill farming and food systems. Feasibility of integrating four local marketing initiatives to traditional hill farming, i) promoting community-supported organic/biodynamic agriculture (CSA), ii) linking traditional farming with school meal (MDM) programs, iii) enhanced market access and value chain development for local plant food resources, and iv) creating off-farm employment opportunity at community level for rural youths, among others, are explored in the present study. The need of re-assessing existing food and nutrition-related health and agriculture policy, and developing cross-sectoral implementation strategies on food and livelihood security, nutrition, and health was also addressed. The outcomes are expected to set priorities for state policy for a more profitable local level agriculture and regenerative food system.

TI  - Resilience through risk management: cooperative insurance in small-holder aquaculture systems
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Aquaculture is a booming industry. It currently supplies almost half of all fish and shellfish eaten today, and it continues to grow faster than any other food production sector. But it is immature relative to terrestrial crop and livestock sectors, and as a consequence it lags behind in terms of the use of aquaculture specific financial risk management tools. In particular, the use of insurance instruments to manage weather related losses is little used. In the aquaculture industry there is a need for new insurance products that achieve both financial gains, in terms of reduced production and revenue risk, and environmental wins, in terms of incentivizing improved management practices. Here, we have developed a cooperative form of indemnity insurance for application to small-holder aquaculture communities in developing nations. We use and advance the theory of risk pools, applying it to an aquaculture community in Myanmar, using empirical data recently collected from a comprehensive farm survey. These data were used to parameterize numerical simulations of this aquaculture system with and without a risk pool. Results highlight the benefits and costs of a risk pool, for various combinations of key parameters. This information reveals a path forward for creating new risk management products for aquaculturalists around the world.

TI  - Food access and pro-poor value chains: a community case study in the central highlands of Peru
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - Pro-poor value chains intend to integrate smallholding farmers into high value markets to contribute to poverty alleviation and food security. Although income benefits of pro-poor value chains have been found, scant evidence exists regarding the potential for these markets to enhance food security. This study focuses on components of food access-dietary diversity, physical and financial access, and social acceptability-among households that participate in pro-poor value chains and non-participating households in the central highlands of Peru where development interventions have created high value market niches for the native potato varieties that smallholding farmers have conserved for thousands of years. Using a mixed methods approach, this study assessed dietary diversity among households that participate and do not participate in pro-poor value chains, as well as their perceptions of their food access. Findings indicated that households that participate in value chains have higher dietary diversity than non-participating households but that these differences are likely due to pre-existing differences in socioeconomic status rather than any causal effect provided by value chains. The study also concluded that while participation in pro-poor value chains sometimes enhance the purchasing power of participating households, they may also weaken financial access, important for both purchasing food and travel to make those purchases. Community perspectives also indicated concerns with the acceptability of diets, which cannot likely be comprehensively addressed by pro-poor value chains. Collectively, the findings from this study cast doubt on the assumption that a linear flow exists between pro-poor value chains and enhanced food access.

TI  - Pro-poor? Inclusion and exclusion in native potato value chains in the central highlands of Peru
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Including smallholding farmers in high value markets has emerged as a pro-poor development strategy. Through a case study of a project that intended to incorporate native potato growers in the central Peruvian highlands into corporate potato chip value chains, this study investigates social differentiation among participants and nonparticipants, as well as reasons for households' inclusion or exclusion. Household surveys and semi-structured interviews in one of the communities where the project was implemented provided the data. Results suggest that value chain participants generally have higher economic status and actively exclude lower-resource households in the community. However, non participation is not necessarily viewed negatively by all non-participating households. Some deliberately choose not to participate to pursue other livelihood strategies or because of risks involved in participating. These findings indicate that participation in value chains is not necessarily beneficial. For such programs to have broad social benefits, policies and other institutional arrangements are needed to minimize risks of participation in such value chains and to provide support for other market outlets.

TI  - Impacts of improved sorghum varieties intensification on household welfare in the mid-Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - Attaining food and income security is a persistent challenge among small holder farmers of Southern Africa. Improved sorghum varieties are widely regarded as a panacea to extreme poverty. The paper uses endogenous switching regression to determine impacts of improved sorghum varieties intensification on household welfare. Household dietary diversity score and household food insecurity access score were used as outcome variables and proxies for food security. Cross-sectional data were generated in the Mid Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe in 2016 from 380 households in a survey conducted with five purposively selected wards. Social association groups, average weighted market prices, household income, age of principal decision maker, dependency ratio, ownership of draught power and storage facilities have significant (p < 0.01) implications on the adoption decision. Counterfactual analyses shows that farmers who allocate more land towards improved sorghum varieties are relatively better off in food diversity and food access. Intensifying improved sorghum varieties can increase dietary diversity by 35% while reducing food insecurity by 29-34%. Social networking can be strengthened through local, government and private partnerships to facilitate generation and efficient dissemination of sorghum production and marketing information. Improving the market prices can increase market size and enhance efficiency along strategic value chain nodes.

TI  - Social networks, rice value chain participation and market performance of smallholder farmers in Ghana
T2  - AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
AB  - This paper examines the impact of rice value chain participation and social networks on smallholder farmers' market performance outcomes (paddy price, quantity of paddy traded, and net returns), using data from a recent survey of 458 smallholder rice farmers in northern Ghana. We employed a treatment effects model to account for potential selection bias associated with observable and unobservable factors. The empirical results reveal that smallholder farmers' participation in a rice value chain is associated with increased paddy price, quantity traded, and net returns. We also find that value chain participation decisions and market performance are positively and significantly influenced by social networks. The empirical results also suggest that sex, farm size, mobile phone ownership, and access to credit significantly increase paddy prices, quantity traded, and net returns of smallholder rice farmers in the value chain.

TI  - Vertical farming: tin mining andagro-minerosin Bolivia
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - Throughout Bolivia, collectives of small-scale miners known as 'mining cooperatives' have developed a reputation for cutthroat extractive practices that were shaped by neoliberal restructuring starting in the 1980s. Charting a history that starts at the turn of the twentieth century, this paper argues that cooperative mining in the tin belt of Northern Potosi has emerged as averticalinstantiation of small-holder farming practices that migrated, along with miners themselves, from surrounding indigenousayllus. In the subterranean, however, these practices interacted with the legacies of tin mining, which was characterized by labor hierarchies that corresponded with vertical variation in ore quality. New social striations crystallized as small-holder farming customs settled into the subterranean structure, creating sharp social differentiation across these subsoil 'family farms.' The class composition of mining cooperatives at the national level has been shaped by these entangled underground histories, with implications for the country's economic and environmental futures.

TI  - Innovations in financing of agri-food value chains in China and India Lessons and policies for inclusive financing
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to synthesize lessons from the agricultural value chain models and their associated financing mechanisms in China and India as to provide policy recommendations on how best to facilitate development of efficient and inclusive value chains.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper builds on a review of the existing literature on agricultural value chains and their financing mechanisms, and draws lessons from it for strengthening interface between product and financial markets in order to enable smallholders capture benefits of the value addition.
   Findings - From the comparative review of value chain financing mechanisms and current policy contexts the authors find dominance of internal financing of value chains (in terms of provision of inputs, technology and services) in both the countries. Value chain finance from commercial banks and other financial institutions is limited and mainly through tripartite agreements among the financing institutions, lead firms and farmers.
   Practical implications - The lessons drawn from various value chain models and their financing mechanisms provide feedback to financial institutions and policymakers to take measures to strengthen value chain finance in smallholder agriculture.
   Originality/value - The paper undertakes a rigorous review of the existing value chain models and their financing mechanisms in light of the most recent research on emerging innovations and development strategies, in order to glean key lessons for policy recommendations on strengthening linkages between financial and product markets.

TI  - Gender dimensions in the local chicken value chain in northern Uganda
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The study was conducted to explore gender dimensions in the local chicken value chain in northern Uganda. Specifically, it focused on characterizing local chicken value chain actors, ascertaining level and determinants of gender participation as well as relationships between gender, access and control over income from local chicken enterprises. Primary data were collected using structured questionnaires administered in a cross-sectional survey of 200 randomly selected local chicken value chain actors. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 10 and StataSE 13 software from which simplified gross margins, descriptive statistics, correlations and a Logit regression model were estimated. Results revealed that majority of value chain actors were aged 20-48 years and males were dominant across most segments in the value chain. Men participated more in input supply, house construction, marketing and barbequing while women participated in production and stewing local chickens. Among actors, processors (UGX 1,911,274) and farmers (UGX 159,691) had the highest and least annual gross margin respectively. The Logit model revealed that age, education level, marital status and income control positively influenced (Pr=0.00) gender participation. Men had more control over income than women. An engendered innovation platform could be established for training and empowerment of local chicken value chain actors.

TI  - Moving smallholders up rice value chain: a system dynamics approach
T2  - BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose Paddy farmers form the backbone of food security. However, poverty plagues them despite having linked them to the rice value chain. To overcome this, the concept of involving smallholders in post-farm value chain stages is promoted. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of upgrading smallholder involvement in rice value chains through the adoption of a sustainability standard. Design/methodology/approach The authors built a system dynamic model to capture both conventional and certified sub-value chains. The latter deviates from the conventional one and capitalizes on compliance to a sustainability standard. Findings When compared to conventional farm gate sales methods, the simulations revealed obvious profitability of direct marketing with respect to certified sustainable rice. Although coupled with productivity growth, the simulations indicated the shift to standard adoption would likely to be both limited and slow. Originality/value The findings suggest that the profitability of a certified rice value chain will remain fettered. In order to enhance both farmer livelihood and food security, given the limited prospect of moving smallholders up that chain, the authors conclude that national policy should be rationalized and concentrated on the possibility of diversifying the end-use of rice through research, development and subsequent commercialization.

TI  - Unpacking policies for the development of agricultural growth poles in West Africa
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES-REVUE CANADIENNE D ETUDES DU DEVELOPPEMENT
AB  - This paper investigates public policies implemented in Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali and Senegal to support the agricultural growth pole model. We critically assess assumptions regarding expected positive spillover effects through vertical coordination and tenure formalisation. Using a comparative analysis based on a typology informed by public economics, we show that policies centre on tax exemptions and land tenure, providing only limited support to coordination of actors along the value chain - through agricultural extension services or access to funding. The ongoing implementation of agropoles in West Africa, therefore, exacerbates the risk of the model, bearing negative impacts for smallholders.

TI  - Primary Sector Value Chains, Poverty Reduction, And Rural Development Challenges In The Philippines
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW
AB  - The insertion of Philippine agriculture and fisheries into global value chains has not contributed significantly to rural poverty reduction, in contrast to several other Southeast Asian countries. While there are pockets of downstream export successes, upstream actors face persistent precarious conditions. This comparative investigation of the relationships between value chains and rural development fills a gap in the literature on the Philippines. An analysis of four important products affecting at least 3 million households illustrates the need to focus more on upstream value-chain governance and pro-poor rural development interventions. This article shows that the integration of livelihoods and value-chain analyses has the advantage of fleshing out upstream challenges that are relevant for agri/aquabusiness performance, socio-spatial policies, and refinements of rural development theories. It is unlikely that horizontal coordination/social capital as well as associated upgrading efforts will be effective without a stronger emphasis on vertical coordination and human-capital formation.

TI  - What role can a livelihood strategy play in addressing climate change? Lessons in improving social capital from an agricultural cooperative in Ukraine
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Increasing support to small-holder farmers plays an important part in meeting the climate and development challenges of agriculture: realizing global food security under increasing climate variability, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and conserving natural resources. Cooperatives offer a well-established livelihood strategy and means to support small-holders. This case study examined a Ukrainian cooperative using the sustainable livelihoods framework (SLF) to understand the role cooperatives play in addressing climate change, and the process by which capacity is used to adapt and/or mitigate climate change. Climate change does not prompt cooperative formation and climate change mitigation might not be a planned outcome in a livelihood strategy. However, modifying the SLF to include climate change outcomes provides a means of understanding the process by which building capacity results in mitigation and adaptation. Cooperative members and stakeholders outside of the cooperative participated in semi-structure interviews. Social capital emerged as a theme with interviewees from all backgrounds. Initially closed networks and distrust prevented members from joining the cooperative. As the cooperative built new networks, the benefit of joining became apparent to members. Information gained through networks improved access to other capitals, improved livelihood outcomes and addressed climate change. Social capital fulfils key roles in the process of capacity building and implementation of sustainable measures; thus improving social capital could arguably be the chief benefit of cooperatives.

TI  - Financial returns for different actors in a teak timber value chain in Paklay District, Lao PDR
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The Government of the Lao PDR has a range of policies, including the promotion of domestic processing and discouraging the export of unprocessed wood, aimed at generating a greater share of benefits to all actors in the value chain. There are however, limited studies of the structures, operations and effects of policies on, value chains. This study aimed to compare financial returns to three different types of actors (growers, traders and a sawmilling and wood products manufacturing company) in a teak value chain in Paklay District of Xayabuly Province. The data were collected from two groups of growers on different site types, two timber traders and an integrated sawmill and wood products manufacturer. These data were triangulated with, and supplemented by, formal and informal interviews with other forest stakeholders in the district and province. Two silvicultural regimes were compared, with a single thinning at 11 years and clearfell at 18 years on good riverside alluvial sites, and 24 years on poorer, hillslopes sites. All sites were profitable for growers, as indicated by internal rates of return. The net returns per cubic meter of final product for the manufacturer is 7.3-20.3 times higher than net returns for the growers. Traders' profits were considerably less than for the two other parts of the chain. Prices for others in the chain are largely controlled by the manufacturer and collaboration and co-innovation between the three actors is unlikely in the current environment. Possible options for increasing growers and traders' incomes and improving value chain links are discussed.

TI  - Integrating the soybean-maize-chicken value chains to attain nutritious diets in Tanzania
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - In Tanzania, diets are dominated by starchy staple crops such as maize, levels of malnutrition are high and largely attributed to lack of dietary diversity. We employed fuzzy cognitive mapping to understand the current soybean, maize and chicken value chains, to highlight stakeholder relationships and to identify entry points for value chain integration to support nutritious diets in Tanzania. The fuzzy cognitive maps were constructed based on information gathered during household interviews with 569 farming households, followed by a participatory workshop with 54 stakeholders involved in the three value chains. We found that the soybean, maize and chicken value chains were interconnected, particularly at the level of the smallholder farming systems and at processing facilities. Smallholder farming households were part of one or more value chains. Chicken feed is an important entry point for integrating the three value chains, as maize and soybean meal are the main sources of energy and protein for chicken. Unlike maize, the utilization of soybean in chicken feed is limited, mainly due to inadequate quality of processing of soybean grain into meal. As a result, the soybean grain produced by smallholders is mainly exported to neighbouring countries for further processing, and soybean meal is imported at relatively high prices. Enhancing local sourcing and adequate processing of soybean, coupled with strengthening the integration of smallholder farmers with other soybean, maize and chicken value chain actors offers an important opportunity to improve access to nutritious diets for local people. Our method revealed the importance of interlinkages that integrate the value chains into a network within domestic markets.

TI  - Value Chain Approaches in a Stagnant Industry: The Case of Furniture Production in Jepara, Indonesia
T2  - BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - This article assesses impacts of the Jepara Furniture Value Chain (FVC) project, which was intended to address challenges faced by small-scale furniture producers in Jepara, Indonesia. The assessment focuses on the effects of membership in the Jepara Small-Scale Furniture Producers Association (APKJ), a body started as part of the FVC project. Propensity score matching was used to compare differences in outcome variables between association members and matched non-members. A limited, positive impact of APKJ membership was found. Members improved their marketing, allowing them to retain more value than non-members. APKJ members were also more likely to have obtained certificates of timber legality. However, APKJ membership did not significantly affect firm profit and there was little evidence of an industry transformation. The paper also critiques the indiscriminate use of a value chain approach.

TI  - Do intermediary institutions promote inclusiveness in PES programs? The case of Costa Rica
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - Payments for environmental services (PES) are often promoted on the basis of a purported win-win scenario in terms of accomplishing dual environmental and social policy objectives. Yet, it has been observed that PES programs tend to exclude small land-owners due to relatively high and largely scale-independent transaction costs. This study seeks to shed light on the role of local intermediaries in PES programs and how they may bring the reality of PES closer to the win-win scenario. This is done through an investigation of three intermediaries in the Costa Rican PES program; an NGO, a producer cooperative, and a county agricultural center. Based on interviews, household surveys, and reviews of PES contracts, the study examines differences in the inclusion of small-holders in the PES program between the three organizations and focuses on understanding the underlying reasons for any observed differences. The results reveal that the cooperative and the agricultural center are more inclusive of small-holders than the NGO. The ability to include small-holders is influenced by the organizations' level of running operational costs, but also by their pre-existing portfolio of activities and relationships with landowners, as well as the land development history of the local area. Finally, the role of intermediaries is highly influenced by the framing of their working conditions by the PES program. This study thus shows the importance of considering the factors that condition the role of intermediaries in securing inclusive and low-cost provision of ES. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Agricultural Value Chain Extension: A panacea for Agricultural Transformation in Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION
AB  - The study examined the effectiveness of value chain extension using some field activities among smallholder farmers in Nigeria and beyond and some farm projects that have adopted value chain extension approach. It revealed that the impact of a value chain extension approach if adopted include increased productivity, better post-harvest management, guaranteed and more remunerative market among others. The study also revealed that quite a number of problems constraining farmers from transforming into agribusiness could effectively be managed using the agricultural value chain extension approach. It was therefore recommended that agricultural value chain extension approach be piloted in selected states in Nigeria with a plan for gradual up-scale, as associated teething problems are being identified and appropriately managed to achieve desired outcomes.

TI  - An analysis of the smallholder farmers' cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) value chain through a gender perspective: the case of Dak Lak province, Vietnam
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - Many rural women, who are faced with the challenges of low rural incomes and gender inequality, improve their role in the farming system based on participation in the agricultural value chain thus enhancing agricultural productivity, household income and sustainable development. This study investigates the factors which affect participation in the production of cassava in Dak Lak Province and decisions in relation to the cassava value chain from a gender perspective. Data were obtained through a questionnaire-based survey of 300 household farmers, in-depth interviews with key informants, and focus group discussions. Probit and ordinary least squares regression models in a two-stage Heckman model were adopted to determine the factors affecting females' decisions to participate in cassava cultivation, their level of participation and their participation in other stages of the cassava value chain. The survey results show that men are prominent in all stages of cassava production but there is a more equal gender dynamic in both cassava production participation decisions and decisions relating to the quantity of cassava to be supplied for commercial purposes. This article draws attention to the continuing role challenges of female smallholder farmers, but also shows how women's empowerment is contingent on equity dynamics in the household as well as social norms in the community and wider society.

TI  - Shaping, adapting and reserving the right to play: Responding to uncertainty in high quality cassava flour value chains in Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explain why the high quality cassava flour (HQCF) value chain in Nigeria has not performed as well as expected. The specific objectives are to: analyse important sources of uncertainty influencing HQCF value chains; explore stakeholders' strategies to respond to uncertainty; and highlight the implications of different adaptation strategies for equity and the environment in the development of the value chain.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors used a conceptual framework based on complex adaptive systems to analyse the slow development of the value chain for HQCF in Nigeria, with a specific focus on how key stakeholders have adapted to uncertainty. The paper is based on information from secondary sources and grey literature. In particular, the authors have drawn heavily on project documents of the Cassava: Adding Value for Africa project (2008 to present), which is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and on the authors' experience with this project.
   Findings Policy changes; demand and supply of HQCF; availability and price of cassava roots; supply and cost of energy are major sources of uncertainty in the chain. Researchers and government have shaped the chain through technology development and policy initiatives. Farmers adapted by selling cassava to rival chains, while processors adapted by switching to rival cassava products, reducing energy costs and vertical integration. However, with uncertainties in HQCF supply, the milling industry has reserved the right to play. Vertical integration offers millers a potential solution to uncertainty in HQCF supply, but raises questions about social and environmental outcomes in the chain.
   Research limitations/implications The use of the framework of complex adaptive systems helped to explain the development of the HQCF value chain in Nigeria. The authors identified sources of uncertainty that have been pivotal in restricting value chain development, including changes in policy environment, the demand for and supply of HQCF, the availability and price of cassava roots, and the availability and cost of energy for flour processing. Value chain actors have responded to these uncertainties in different ways. Analysing these responses in terms of adaptation provides useful insights into why the value chain for HQCF in Nigeria has been so slow to develop.
   Social implications Recent developments suggest that the most effective strategy for the milling industry to reduce uncertainty in the HQCF value chain is through vertical integration, producing their own cassava roots and flour. This raises concerns about equity. Until now, it has been assumed that the development of the value chain for HQCF can combine both growth and equity objectives. The validity of this assumption now seems to be open to question. The extent to which these developments of HQCF value chains can combine economic growth, equity and environmental objectives, as set out in the sustainable development goals, is an open question.
   Originality/value The originality lies in the analysis of the development of HQCF value chains in Nigeria through the lens of complex adaptive systems, with a particular focus on uncertainty and adaptation. In order to explore adaptation, the authors employ Courtney et al.'s (1997) conceptualization of business strategy under conditions of uncertainty. They argue that organisations can assume three strategic postures in response to uncertainty and three types of actions to implement that strategy. This combination of frameworks provides a fresh means of understanding the importance of uncertainty and different actors' strategies in the development of value chains in a developing country context.

TI  - The African Indigenous Vegetables Value Chain Governance in Kenya
T2  - STUDIES IN AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Increasingly, food security interventions in developing economies are adapting value chain approaches to facilitate the integration of smallholders into high margin value chains. In Kenya, the resurgence of African Indigenous Vegetables due to their medicinal value and rich micronutrients is a case in point. The vegetables are cultivated by smallholders, and the supply has not matched the demand in the high margin markets among urban consumers. Access to such high margin markets necessitates that smallholders gain entry or upgrade into the networks of those buyers who possess considerable control of these value chains. There is limited value chain scholarship on chain governance and its implication for smallholder participation in Kenya. This study investigated how value chain governance influences farmer participation in vegetable markets and food security in Kenya. This study employed exploratory case study design to provide chain architecture, isolate primary actors, their roles, relations, constraints and opportunities for upgrading by smallholders. A mixed method approach involving a multi-stage sampling technique of 339 respondents was employed to bring to the surface insights on chain architecture, market margins and governance structures and their implications as regards upgrading trajectories for small-scale farmers in Kenya. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. Spot market relations were found to dominate traditional value chains in rural areas while peri-urban areas exhibited both traditional and coordinated value chains. The value chains are characterised by very weak linkages between upstream actors and downstream partners, where wholesalers and supermarkets play the role of leading firms in traditional and coordinated value chains, respectively. The study recommends the inclusion of famers in market management committees and the establishment of binding contractual arrangements with supermarkets.

TI  - Analysis of pearl millet market structure and value chain in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the market structure and value chain of pearl millet grain and fodder in India. There is a decline in demand for human consumption, with an increase in demand for non-food uses like cattle and poultry feed, raw material for starch and breweries industry. This paper explores alternative channels, uses and value chains of pearl millet grain and fodder. The paper examines in what ways small farmers can benefit from the evolving alternative uses for pearl millet grain in cattle and poultry feed industry, breweries and starch industry. The paper also analyses the impact of aggregators in increasing the efficiency of the value chain.
   Design/methodology/approach The study collected primary data from farmers, traders, commission agents and exporters and importers with innovative marketing channels with aggregators (Self-Help Groups) and without aggregators to analyze the prospects for improvements in marketing channels and value chain.
   Findings Given that the production of pearl millet is scattered and thin, there is a lot of scope for market aggregators to increase scale economies to reduce market costs to supply in bulk to food and industrial uses. Although there was some demand for human consumption high-quality grain, most of the future demand will come from cattle and poultry feed industry, breweries and starch industry. To tap these larger potentials, farmers need to aggregate their produce and ensure regular supply in bulk quantity at least to compete the cost with alternative grains like maize and broken rice.
   Research limitations/implications The research is based on the field-level data collection and observations obtained from Western India. This paper provides insights how the value chain of pearl millet is working and what improvements are needed to make value chain more efficient and inclusive. Although the results are applicable to similar neglected crops and area, more caution is needed.
   Social implications Through the formation of farmer aggregators, farmers can enhance their bargaining power vis-a-vis industry.
   Originality/value Till now, there is no study that explored the pearl millet value chain in detail in India, and the paper tries to fill this literature gap.

TI  - Supermarket-Led Development and the Neglect of Traditional Food Value Chains: Reflections on Indonesia's Agri-Food System Transformation
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The rapid expansion of modern food retail encapsulated in the so-called supermarket revolution' is often portrayed as a pivotal driving force in the modernization of agri-food systems in the Global South. Based on fieldwork conducted on horticulture value chains in West Java and South Sulawesi, this paper explores this phenomenon and the concerted efforts that government and corporate actors undertake with regard to agri-food value chain interventions and market modernization in Indonesia. The paper argues that after more than 15 years of supermarket revolution' in Indonesia, traditional food retail appears not to be in complete demise, but rather adaptive and resilient to its modern competitors. The analysis of local manifestations of supermarket-led agricultural development suggests that traditional markets can offer certain advantages for farmers over supermarket-driven value chains. The paper further identifies and discusses two areas that have so far been neglected by research and policymaking and which warrant further investigation: (i) the simultaneous transformations in traditional food value chains and their relation to modern markets, and (ii) the social and environmental performances of modern vis-a-vis traditional food value chains.

TI  - Inclusive innovation for ventage development in value chain of potato in the Andean
T2  - REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE LA PAPA
AB  - Despite the increasing use of innovation systems and development approaches based on value chains to stimulate the growth of rural incomes, poverty reduction and greater gender equality there is little systematic knowledge about how to operationalize the value chain approaches in different contexts, and how to extend their benefits. This article considers the development of the value chain in competitive terms, as a type of intervention that promotes the development of competitive advantages and contributes to the reduction of poverty, by improving the links between small farmers, merchants, processors and consumers within of a value chain. Participatory Market Chain Approach (PMCA) is described as a flexible approach involving value chain actors researchers and other service providers in a collective process that explores the potential business opportunities for the benefit of small farmers and other actors in the chain. This approach was developed and applied first in Peru, and then, through knowledge exchange, it has been validated by CIP and local organizations in Bolivia and Ecuador in the Andean region. Experiences about its implementation and adjustment of the approach in these contexts are described as well as the conditions that have allowed the promotion of innovations as a basis to develop competitive advantages. The document concludes with lessons on implementation that contribute to improving the design of interventions and the promotion of value chain approaches in different contexts.

TI  - Negotiating the Value Chain: A Study of Surplus and Distribution in Indian Markets for Food
T2  - LAW AND SOCIAL INQUIRY-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN BAR FOUNDATION
AB  - To enhance the welfare of smallholder farmers, development agencies increasingly promote "value chain agriculture" where farmers partner with more powerful entities, such as corporations and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), to create new sources of economic value. Via a qualitative study of how small farmers negotiate with the buyers of retail and agribusiness corporations in India, this article explores why the promise of value creation can appear so elusive on the ground. It makes two primary contributions. For global value chain scholars, it illustrates how studying value chains "below" the level of the firm illuminates complex ways in which new pathways for economic development are constrained by actually existing local economies-and how these local economies, rather than easily replaced, shape what counts as a source of value for small farmers. For negotiation scholars, it illustrates how, in some contexts, an equitable distribution of risk and social relationships may need to precede anything we call value creation.

TI  - Impact of traditional versus modern dairy value chains on food security: Evidence from India's dairy sector
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - The Indian government has made significant efforts to promote dairy cooperatives to link the milk producers with consumers. Despite this, milk marketing is still dominated by traditional outlets. This paper examines the impact of modern dairy value chains on food security indicators such as net returns from dairying and consumption expenditures. Using a large, national, farm-level dataset from India and a multinomial endogenous switching regression model, results reveal that Indian dairy farmers' integration with the modern dairy value chain has a positive and significant impact on their food security (measured by net returns and household consumption expenditures). Participation in modern milk-marketing outlets significantly increases net returns per year, regardless of whether farmers choose one outlet or a combination.

TI  - Conditions for participation of marginalized households in shrimp value chains of the coastal region of Bangladesh
T2  - AQUACULTURE
AB  - Although shrimp aquaculture generates considerable employment opportunities at different levels, marginalized households are not necessarily able to participate in shrimp value chains due to lack of land and access to other required resources. This study aims to investigate the conditions and determinants of marginalized households' participation in shrimp value chain using both qualitative and quantitative data obtained from 270 households in South-western coastal Bangladesh. We find that marginalized households are engaged in shrimp value chains mostly as labourers. Both the participant and non-participant marginalized households show their keen interest to become shrimp farmers. The study shows that financing, leasing land, attending training for technical knowledge, self-initiative and mental strength are the major conditions for becoming shrimp farmers. The results confirm some previous findings that household income, gender, larger family size with better access to market and required capital are the determinants of participation in shrimp value chain activities. Those who participate in shrimp value chain as respective actors have higher monthly household income than those who do not participate. They are mostly male and they have larger family size than non-participants.

AB  - Turkey needs tobacco production and price policies with carefully determined objectives and tools that are never changing by political tendencies and all decisions taken and to be taken should be applied under no pressure as the policies point out. The purposes of this paper were performing an economic analysis of oriental tobacco or "Turkish Tobacco" production under the contract farming, and provide a guide for oriental tobacco producers budgeting specific cost categories and estimating a net return the production In Turkey to evaluate tobacco production and price policy. Cost, yield and price data were analyzed to determine the profitability. Net return obtained from tobacco growing 0.49 $/kg. The paper finds that tobacco is lowly profitable cash crop for growers. Many commercial growers have diversified sources of income, and most small hold tobacco growers only small amount of tobacco, and grow other crops (olive and cereals), specifically to lessen their dependence on tobacco.

TI  - Dynamics and Determinants of Participation in Integrated Aquaculture-Agriculture Value Chain: Evidence from a Panel Data Analysis of Indigenous Smallholders in Bangladesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - This study examines the dynamics of integrated aquaculture-agriculture (IAA) value chain participation and assess the determinants of participation (non-participators, continuing participators, and leavers) using three wave panel data obtained from small-scale indigenous farm households in Northern and North-eastern region of Bangladesh. We employ panel estimation strategies to control for omitted variables and endogenous regressors. The results confirm some previous findings that educated, larger family size with better access to extension, market information and community-based organisation (CBO) are more likely to participate and continue in IAA value chain activities. Importantly, farm size and farm income does not matters for IAA value chain continuous participation, suggesting that IAA value chain activities are appropriate for resource-poor households who are only able to afford low-input technology. The results also indicate that the factors influencing continued participation and dis-participation of the IAA value chain activities especially for up and downstream activities are different.

TI  - Value Chain Upgrading and the Inclusion of Smallholders in Markets: Reflections on Contributions of Multi-Stakeholder Processes in Dairy Development in Tanzania
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Increasingly, value chain approaches are integrated with multi-stakeholder processes to facilitate inclusive innovation and value chain upgrading of smallholders. This pathway to smallholder integration into agri-food markets has received limited analysis. This article analyses this integration through a case study of an ongoing smallholder dairy development programme in Tanzania. Value chain upgrading and innovation systems perspectives were combined in an analytical framework to interpret the findings, which show that multi-stakeholder processes enhance horizontal and vertical coordination but limit process and product upgrading. The main conclusion is that, although such processes may catalyze smallholder market inclusion, their effects are largely bounded by existing value chain structures (e.g. production system, fragmented markets), timeframe and how prevailing institutional constraints are addressed, which may constrain the intentions of such collaboration action. This calls attention to the starting points of value chain interventions and the socio-political dynamics that are part of multi-stakeholder processes.

TI  - When agricultural commercialization fails: 'Re-visiting' value-chain agriculture and its ruins in northern Ghana
T2  - GLOBALIZATIONS
AB  - Commercialization via value-chain agriculture, under which small farmers often collaborate with big companies, has become a prominent development strategy across Africa. Often framed in win-win terms, the dark sides of such projects (e.g. project failure, related losses) are often sidelined in both academic and practitioner discourses on agricultural commercialization. Informed by a collaborative ethnography of a failed value-chain agriculture project in Ghana, this paper seeks to contribute to a better understanding of how farmers, agribusiness companies, and development organizations engage with and shape commercialization processes, and how those most affected - farmers and their communities - experience often risky and conflict-prone ventures. In contrast to the win-win-rhetoric adopted by funders and corporate partners in such projects, we foreground the uneven distribution of risk and sacrifice/losses between farmers, communities, and corporate partners; the socially and materially disruptive nature of commercialization projects for host communities; and the clashes between a planner's view of the world and the environmental realities of commercialization.

TI  - Value chain analysis of banana in Bench Maji and Sheka Zones of Southern Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - Banana is produced by the highest number of farmers in Bench Maji and Sheka zones of the Southern region of Ethiopia. Even though the zones have high banana production potential, several constraints hamper the development of the banana sector along with the value chain. Therefore, this study was intended to analyze banana value chain in these zones of Ethiopia. Data from 180 banana producers were collected and analyzed by using descriptive statistics, marketing margin and econometric Heckman two-stage model. The result showed there is a weak relationship between banana value chain actors. The marketing margin result showed that collectors from the traders' side received the highest profit share in the banana value chain. The econometric regression result showed that extension contact, type of varieties utilized, the area allocated for banana production, distance to the nearest market, total income and education level are significantly determining factors of banana market participation. In addition, lack of an organized market, low demand during the production season, expensiveness of improved varieties and disease were top identified problems by banana producers. Thus, the concerned stakeholders and government need to give attention to increasing improved banana varieties access and improving the technical knowledge of banana producers on using best practices by arranging cross visits and field trips to areas with best banana production practice. In addition, the promotion of value addition practices and the establishment of banana cooperatives to overcome the marketing problem are also suggested.

TI  - Commercialization pathways for climate services for small holder farmers in the global South
T2  - CLIMATE SERVICES
AB  - Climate change disproportionally affects many countries in the Global South where smallholder farmers make up the majority of the agricultural sector. Weather and Climate Information Services (WCIS) bridge the gap between smallholder farmers and scientific weather forecasts to create actionable knowledge to assist farmers to make optimal agricultural decisions. Over the past years there has been a spur in WCIS initiatives targeting smallholder farmers. However, many projects fail to commercialize and create a long-term impact. The current study addresses this issue by studying potential commercialization pathways of WCIS for smallholder farmers in the Global South. WCIS representatives and experts were interviewed to reach a deeper understanding of the barriers and opportunities of different, potential commercialization pathways.The results indicate that there are multiple commercialization pathways for WCIS for smallholder farmers in the Global South. Projects may employ a wide variety of business development activities, partnerships and revenue models to sustain their business. Many WCIS rely on donor money, which poses a threat to the market and the commercialization process. The results suggest that a revenue model where a third party absorbs costs to the end-user is most promising, whereas a user-pay model seems to have the least potential. There are several possibilities for future scenarios for WCIS in the Global South such as to seek collaboration with the National Meteorological Departments, integrate with a partner in the value chain of smallholder farmers or to create an academic spin-off and become a service platform for smallholder farmers.

TI  - Integrated Value Chain Development: Evidence from Bangladesh
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Agricultural productivity and farmer welfare in developing countries is constrained by a multitude of market imperfections. Value chain development (VCD) is receiving much attention as a market-based policy instrument that can potentially address multiple of these constraints simultaneously. This paper provides a conceptualization of VCD and discusses how VCD can be used as a policy instrument. As an illustration, the paper describes the VCD project "SAFAL," which uses an integrated approach to directly intervene in aquaculture, horticulture, and dairy value chains in South-West Bangladesh. The strategy is to first identify a demand downstream in the value chain and then to identify and reduce the constraints experienced by value chain actors upstream to meet this demand. Using a matched difference-in-difference methodology, this paper estimates farm household participation in SAFAL increases farm income and shortens the hungry season.

TI  - Public-private strategies to establish a successful avocado export cycle: cases from Colombia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this research is to study the Colombian avocado export industry, identify key insights associated with creating and sustaining the avocado value chain, and to understand the impact of the public policies affecting this industry.
   Design/methodology/approach - The approach consists of two case studies to shed light on the opportunities and challenges of developing a sustainable avocado value chain in Colombia. One case deals with a vertically integrated business (Arcangel Miguel) while the other focuses on an association of small growers (Asohass). The analysis was informed by a series of interviews with key actors along the avocado supply chain to uncover the business strategies to move avocados to destination markets. The authors compare and contrast approaches to business development, international expansion, and role of public policies.
   Findings - The authors found that the strategies followed by these organizations differ in means but aim for the same objective: maximize profits, improve environmental performance, and enhance the social wellbeing of growers. The authors found that each type of business model requires distinct public policies to succeed and different strategies to appropriately allocate efforts. The findings are relevant to other high-value crops and other Latin American countries with similar geographical and social characteristics.
   Research limitations/implications - These insights underscore the need of public policies tailored to the specific needs of the different actors in the value chain. The current emphasis on certifications and export markets works well for large agribusinesses, but smallholder growers need policies tailored to new investments in physical, human, and social capital.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature on avocado value chains in Latin America, emphasizing the challenges faced by the emergent Colombia avocado sector, a country that only began exporting this commodity in 2010.

TI  - From Farmers to Entrepreneurs-Strengthening Malta Orange Value Chains Through Institutional Development in Uttarakhand, India
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Malta orange (Citrus sinensis) is an important cash crop in the mountain state of Uttarakhand, India. Smallholder farmers growing it face multiple challenges due to unorganized and inaccessible markets; they are forced to sell to intermediaries at very low prices. In response, the government of Uttarakhand introduced a minimum support price for Malta oranges; however, this failed to address farmers' problems due to poor implementation. This paper presents the results of an action research project with farmers in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand to develop farmers' resilience by upgrading their position in the Malta orange value chain, targeting production, processing, and marketing through community-based enterprise development. Information was collected before and after the intervention by various means, including stakeholder meetings, focus group discussions, and interviews with farmers and value chain facilitators. Activities supported by the research have contributed to increased productivity and farmer incomes. Farmers became better organized, and their bargaining power improved considerably. The enterprise-based upgrading process brought about an inclusive and pro-poor Malta orange value chain system with improved terms of engagement for smallholder farmers. The research results show that policy change, improved provision of technical and financial services, establishment of common facility centers, and strengthening of farmers' institutions are imperative to enable smallholder farmers to engage in value chains and thus increase their resilience.

TI  - Integrative and Exclusionary Roles of Trust in Timber Value Chain in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania
T2  - FORUM FOR DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - Contract and trust are the two main governance mechanisms that influence actors' integration into value chains. Nevertheless, most studies treat trust as a complement to formal contract, paying less attention on the circumstances in which trust becomes a sole mechanism of governance. The aim of this article is to examine how trust shapes integration in the non-industrial timber value chain in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. Timber, which is the pillar of the districts' revenue in the area, contributes significantly to the income of smallholder households. The study adopted an exploratory cross-sectional study design whereby data were collected mainly through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with actors of the timber value chain. The findings showed that spot market and relational governance were the two main linkages in the timber value chain. Spot market linkage is characterized by absence or little trust, while some trust is present in relational linkage. In relational linkage, trust helps integration of actors in the value chain through enabling them access market information, capital in the form of credit, technology for processing timber, and coordination and collaboration among the actors. However, trust is associated with some challenges and to some actors, it plays an exclusionary role. The study recommends for the promotion of trust along with other social control mechanisms such as social knowledge in order to address these challenges.

TI  - Paying more to make less: value degrading in the coffee value chain in eastern Uganda
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Value upgrading through processing has been a core tenet of value chain interventions focusing on improving smallholder farmer welfare improvements. However, assessing the quality of processed agricultural products may be more difficult than unprocessed products. The resulting information asymmetry between producer and the buyer may lead to perverse outcomes for agrarian households. Using primary panel data collected from over 1500 coffee growing households in eastern Uganda and employing fixed effects approaches, we show that grower-level post-harvest processing has characteristics of a market for lemons and is associated with lower coffee income compared with unprocessed coffee production. Activities aiming at moving growers up the value chain should thus be integrated with relevant characteristics of the value chain, such as quality assurance. We add to the literature by presenting a clear description of the pathway from supply chains with asymmetric information over produce quality to diminished farmer welfare with a novel focus on post-harvest processing.

TI  - Unlocking the Household "Black Box': A Gendered Analysis of Smallholder Farmers' Participation in the Cassava (Manihot esculenta crantz) Value Chain in Tanzania
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Women in developing countries are often omitted from key parts of the agricultural value chains. We used household survey data in bi-probit and ordinary least squares regression models to estimate the determinants of women's participation in cassava cultivation and marketing in Tanzania. Land size and region, among other factors, were significant determinants of household decisions to grow cassava. Policies for improving women's land rights and infrastructure would help to promote their participation in cassava production, processing and marketing. Improved methods of delivering extension information would also improve women's participation in the cassava value chain markets. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Women's empowerment and gender equality in agricultural value chains: evidence from four countries in Asia and Africa
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Women play important roles at different nodes of both agricultural and off-farm value chains, but in many countries their contributions are either underestimated or limited by prevailing societal norms or gender-specific barriers. We use primary data collected in Asia (Bangladesh, Philippines) and Africa (Benin, Malawi) to examine the relationships between women's empowerment, gender equality, and participation in a variety of local agricultural value chains that comprise the food system. We find that the value chain and the specific node of engagement matter, as do other individual and household characteristics, but in different ways depending on country context. Entrepreneurship-often engaged in by wealthier households with greater ability to take risks-is not necessarily empowering for women; nor is household wealth, as proxied by their asset ownership. Increased involvement in the market is not necessarily correlated with greater gender equality. Education is positively correlated with higher empowerment of both men and women, but the strength of this association varies. Training and extension services are generally positively associated with empowerment but could also exacerbate the inequality in empowerment between men and women in the same household. All in all, culture and context determine whether participation in value chains-and which node of the value chain-is empowering. In designing food systems interventions, care should be taken to consider the social and cultural contexts in which these food systems operate, so that interventions do not exacerbate existing gender inequalities.

TI  - Welfare implications of participating in agri-value chains among vegetable farmers in Northern Ghana
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - This study investigates the welfare implications of agri-value chain participation utilizing data collected from 423 smallholder vegetable farmers in northern Ghana. The endogenous switching regression (ESR) model estimates the determinants of agri-value chain participation and their associated impacts on farmers' welfare, measured by household income and consumption expenditure. The ESR model accounts for selectivity bias associated with observed and unobserved factors. We find that agri-value chain participation improves vegetable farmers' welfare. Participation significantly increases household income and consumption expenditure by about 22% and 40%, respectively. Our results also reveal that agri-value chain participation is significantly determined by education, household size, mobile phone ownership, irrigation, farm size, farmer group membership, and extension visits. Variables such as education, access to irrigation, farm size, access to credit, farmer group membership, and extension are the significant determinants of farmers' welfare [EconLit Citations: D24, Q12, Q18].

TI  - The river basin game as a tool for collective water management at community level in South Africa
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
CP  - 8th WaterNet/Warfsa/GWP SA Symposium
AB  - Water scarcity in semi-arid catchments presents challenges on achieving equitable sharing of available water resources and avoiding social tensions among small-holder farmers. This paper explores the implementation of a river basin game as a tool to facilitate negotiations and rules of equal access among upstream and downstream irrigation water users in Ga-Sekororo, Olifants river basin in South Africa. The various stages of the game playing methodology are presented in a progressive manner and the outcomes are discussed. Through the application of this game, farmers were able to better relate to their catchment and accepted the board's schematic representation of their reality. They were able to understand top-tail inequities of water supply and to appreciate that solutions lie in the community. The coming together of the small-holder farmers to share knowledge and set agreements on equitable water sharing results in higher benefits such as community harmony, transparency, acceptance of operating rules and improved knowledge to the community as a whole. The collective negotiation exercise produces more acceptable water allocation rules, thereby improving the security of water supply to the irrigation schemes. The paper concludes that local level management of tensions and conflicts through participation as facilitated by the river basin games can be sustainable provided there is proactive support from higher level institutions such as water committees, government and research.

TI  - Functioning of farm-grown timber value chains: Lessons from the smallholder-produced teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) poles value chain in Southern Benin
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The study examined the functioning of the smallholder-produced teak poles value chain in Southern Benin from an analytical perspective combining the governance structure, the institutional environment, and the distribution of consumer price among chain actors. The objective was to identify bottlenecks militating against improved functioning of the farm-grown timber value chains. A fieldwork was carried from August 2008 to September 2010, to identify the agents and the organisations involved in the value chain. Data were collected on the functions performed, the costs borne and the income received by each category of agent, the marketing channels within the value chain, the interactions among agents, the consumption of the product, and the role of the organisations connected to the value chain. This was done by combining semi-structured interviews, focus group meetings, and structured interviews. In addition, data were collected on the institutional environment from both primary and secondary sources. The following agents were involved in the value chain: nurserymen, planters, local intermediaries, brokers, traders, and consumers. The forest service was the main governmental organisation involved in the functioning of the value chain. The governance structure in the value chain was driven by a mixture of government and the market. Various weaknesses were found in the forest policy, the forest regulation and their implementation. Planters' share of consumer price was lower than traders' return. The relevant policy options to address these issues were discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Analysis of cassava value chain in Ghana: implications for upgrading smallholder supply systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose Commercialization of cassava is increasing because of increased urban demand for processed products and increased recognition of the industrial potential of the crop. This study aims to examine the cassava value chain in Ghana and its implications for upgrading. Design/methodology/approach A combination of purposive, simple random and snowball sampling methods was adopted to select key actors in the cassava value chain. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data. Analysis of the data was largely descriptive, except for profitability of cassava production in selected regions, which was examined by employing gross and net marketing margin analysis. A comprehensive value chain map was generated to show the different product pathways for cassava from the farm gate to the final consumer, and roles of key value chain actors and their relationships were summarized through simple narrations. Findings Evidence has shown chains of more than four different channels through which fresh cassava roots move from the farm gate to final consumers. Production of cassava in Ghana is profitable, generating positive net marketing margins across major producing centres. Processing of cassava has both dry and wet/fresh value chains depending on the derived products for the final consumer. There is weak governance system in the cassava value chain in Ghana as majority of actors use spot market transactions in dealing with trading partners. The use of standardized grading and weighing system is very limited in the chain, and limited access to credit is a critical constraint to value chain upgrading. Research limitations/implications With the exception of results from the profitability analysis of producers, the findings on marketing margins of other value chain actors may not be generalizable. Future studies could determine the profitability associated with cassava value-adding activities like processing into various forms and explore the possibility of converting waste from processing into energy. Practical implications The study includes implications that focus on product and process upgrading efforts by smallholders in the cassava value chain. This paper recommends innovative financing models for smallholders to improve access to microcredit via internal and external funding sources. Originality/value This paper reveals specific intervention areas in which smallholders can direct efforts in an attempt to improve the cassava value chain through product, process and functional upgrading.

AB  - Several studies have shown that traditional vegetables have high market potential and contribute substantially to household incomes and nutrition. Until recently however, the scientific and donor community often give less attention to research on traditional vegetable crop value chains. The resurgence of traditional vegetables' importance in human nutrition is accompanied by a need to understand the interactions among various actors in their value chain to determine ways to add value to produce and improve marketing efficiency. Based on a multistage cross-sectional survey of 240 respondents in Malawi and Mozambique, this study employed participatory evaluation and market research to identify potential outlets and target crops, and define value chain processes, including choice of market outlets and mode of farmer-buyer linkages. Traditional vegetable sales contributed about 35% and 30% of smallholders' income in Malawi and Mozambique respectively. Linkages between value chain actors were found to be weak; mostly based on spot market transactions, except for those between retailers and supermarkets, which were based on relationship marketing.

TI  - Sugar-Cane and Oil Palm Expansion in Guatemala and its Consequences for the Regional Economy
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE
AB  - Corporate-owned sugar-cane and oil palm plantations in Guatemala are expanding at the expense of smallholder agriculture. Land control grabs are not only having consequences for local communities and ecosystems, but also for regional economies. The present study compares the value chains of smallholder products with those of sugar and palm oil. Primary data were collected from agricultural producers and their backward and forward sectors in the agricultural regions where the plantations are most prominent. The results show that on a regional level, sugar and palm oil generate fewer jobs in comparison to the products of small-scale agriculture, which have important forward linkages to small and medium trading and processing sectors. In addition, the wealth created by small-scale farming remains within the regions, whereas profits from the sugar and palm oil industries are being transferred out of them. Therefore, to achieve inclusive regional development, smallholder agriculture should be strengthened rather than promoting monoculture expansion.

TI  - When Agronomy Flirts with Markets, Gender, and Nutrition: A Political Ecology of the New Green Revolution for Africa and Women's Food Security in Burkina Faso
T2  - AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW
AB  - Advocates of the Green Revolution for Africa (GR4A) argue that the best way to address malnutrition is to incorporate smallholders into the global food economy via value chains involving the use of improved inputs, production technologies, and access to markets. Moseley and Ouedraogo critically assess these tactics using a feminist political ecology lens to analyze GR4A efforts in southwestern Burkina Faso which target female rice farmers. They examine the nature of the GR4A rice value chain, the degree to which a GR4A project is impacting the nutrition of participating women, and the influence of gender roles on GR4A rice project outcomes.

TI  - African swine fever control and market integration in Ugandan peri-urban smallholder pig value chains: An ex-ante impact assessment of interventions and their interaction
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - Pig production in peri-urban smallholder value chains in Uganda is severely constrained by impact of disease, particularly African swine fever (ASF), and the economic consequences of an inefficient pig value chain. Interventions in the form of biosecurity to control ASF disease outbreaks and pig business hub models to better link smallholder farmers to pig markets have the potential to address the constraints. However, there is a dearth of evidence of the effects of the interventions on performance and distribution of outcomes along the pig value chain. An ex-ante impact assessment utilising System Dynamics model was used to assess the impact of the interventions in peri-urban pig value chains in Masaka district. The results showed that although implementation of biosecurity interventions results in reduction of ASF outbreaks, it also leads to a 6.3% reduction in farmer profit margins per year but more than 7% increase in other value chain actors' margins. The pig business hub intervention alone results in positive margins for all value chain actors but minimal reduction in ASF outbreaks. When biosecurity and the pig business hub interventions are implemented together, the interaction effects of the interventions result in positive outcomes for both the control of ASF and improvement in farmers' margins. Farmers may therefore be unwilling to adopt biosecurity practices if implemented alone to control ASF outbreaks unless there is a corresponding financial incentive to compensate for the high costs. This has implications for policy or developing institutions to facilitate cost sharing arrangement among chain actors and/or third party subsidy to provide incentives for producers to adopt biosecurity measures.

TI  - A Study on Milk Value Chains for Poor People in Bangladesh
T2  - IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - Child and maternal undernutrition is still prevalent in Bangladesh and poor dietary diversity is one of the major causes. While milk can contribute to nutritional requirements, currently availability in Bangladesh is 126ml/person/day, whereas recommended consumption is 250ml/person/day. This case study was conducted to identify existing milk value chains and the milk consumption behaviour of poor people. Priority was given to women and children as they are the most vulnerable in both rural and urban areas. It was observed that both formal and informal value chains coexist where milk collectors and chilling centres have a lead role. At the household level, milk purchase decisions are usually taken by men in rural areas, whereas in urban areas women take part equally in the process. Government and private sector initiatives can play a role in increasing milk production and consumption through greater investment. Behavioural change communication is also vital to build awareness of milk consumption.

TI  - Promotion of beekeeping: Insights from an empirical analysis of three honey value chains in Benin
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
AB  - Beekeeping is increasingly promoted in developing countries as a promising option for income diversification in rural areas while contributing to poverty alleviation. Unfortunately, the development of the value chains of its most known and marketed product (honey) is still in its beginning stages. Little is known about the honey value chain environment and entry points for its development. Through interviews with 406 informants, this study investigated three honey value chains - "honey harvested in wild," "honey from traditional beekeeping" and "honey from semi-modern beekeeping." Data was collected on their operation, profitability, and long-term perspectives. The following agents were involved in the value chains: input suppliers, honey producers, middlemen, transporters, and consumers. Farmer's associations, government, non-governmental organizations, quality control organizations, and financial organizations were also involved in the operation of the value chain of honey from semi-modern beekeeping. In the case of the value chains of honey harvested in the wild and honey from traditional beekeeping, only a government department and financial organizations were involved in its operation. Networks were the main coordination mechanism in the value chain of honey from semi-modern beekeeping. There was a low representativeness of market coordination in the three value chains. The value chain of honey from semi-modern beekeeping had the highest value-added. All of the value chains were financially profitable, but various weaknesses prevented the efficiency of the value chains. Relevant policy options are discussed to address these issues.

TI  - Cost-benefit analysis of prioritized climate-smart agricultural practices among smallholder farmers: evidence from selected value chains across sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Prioritization of adaptation options is complex. This study presents a multi-dimensional framework to evaluate how to allocate resources among competing alternatives. The main objectives of the study were to identify the prioritized climate-smart agricultural practices adopted among smallholder farmers in different value chains across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and to assess the economic feasibility of the practices using Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) to develop a portfolio of viable and cost-effective options. This study focused on selected five SSA countries and selected value chains. 153 smallholder farmers and stakeholders were interviewed. The Climate Smart Agriculture Prioritization Framework was applied for the assessment of economically viable adaptation options. The prioritization was based on standard ranks on the ability of the practice to improve productivity, increase resilience, and mitigation. Spearman's rank-order correlation was used to assess the independence of the ranks. A CBA was conducted as the final step. Smallholder farmers in the study areas prioritized the adoption of improved seed, good agricultural practices, and conservation agriculture practices. In the sweet potato value chain in Kenya, good agricultural practices was viable with an NPV of US$ 28,044, an IRR of 328%, and a one-year payback period. This is in comparison to the improved seed varieties (US$ 8,738, 111%, and two years payback period) respectively. In Nigeria, the most viable option was the improved seed in the potato value chain and good agricultural practices in the rice value chain. In Malawi, Ethiopia, and Zambia, the most viable practices were improved seed, and conservation agriculture in the soybean, faba beans, and peanut value chains respectively. The NPV was highly sensitive to changes in the discount rate, moderately to price, yield, and practice lifecycle, and least to changes in annual labour costs. The results elaborate on the most feasible adaptation practices that enable smallholder farmers to increase productivity and be economically efficient. The use of the CSA-PF consecutively with the CBA tool allows for the proper identification of best-bet CSA options.

TI  - Digital connectivity at the upstream end of value chains: A dynamic perspective on smartphone adoption amongst horticultural smallholders in Kenya
T2  - COMPETITION & CHANGE
AB  - Driven by the rapid adoption of Internet-based technologies amongst producers in the Global South, the question of how and whether global value chain arrangements are reconfigured remains open to debate. This article addresses the changing practices of export-oriented smallholders accompanying the transition from simple phone towards smartphone use. Our dynamic approach compares cross-sectional survey data from 2013 and 2017 to answer to what extent Kenyan smallholders have adopted the Internet, which digital practices in relation to agricultural value chains they use and how this affects the inter-firm coordination between smallholders and subsequent actors. Smartphones have gained broad importance for smallholders as they are used for digital practices in value chains. Contrary to the debated dark sides of Internet connectivity, we can however not confirm sweeping digital control or value appropriation by lead firms. So far, long-established, analogue practices widely persist in arrangements between smallholders and exporters. Nevertheless, smartphones are used to nurture multilateral knowledge networks of unprecedented reach and size and further allow for incipient experiments with marketing strategies on digital marketing platforms devoted to domestic markets. We argue that these practices resemble strategic niche seeking that has to be interpreted in relation to captive export arrangements. With qualitatively and quantitatively increasing options to access and share knowledge and to market commodities, the Internet can serve to navigate the multiplicity of chain alternatives (domestic production, informal export production). Such niches should be considered as creating leverage against the take it or leave it deal of captive export production.

TI  - Forage seed value chain analysis in a subhumid region of Zimbabwe: perspectives of smallholder producers
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE
AB  - In smallholder systems, farmers are increasingly becoming aware of the need to improve livestock productivity through production of quality fodder. This is in response to scarcity of feed, particularly in the dry season, associated with seasonal variations, land degradation and the need to meet increases in demand for livestock products. The study investigated forage seed production, marketing, challenges faced and opportunities along the value chain in Zimbabwe. Data were collected from 414 smallholder farmer households through a survey, four focus group discussions and 12 key informants. Results show that forage seed is mainly sourced from development organisations. Actors include farmer producers, seed companies, research and extension institutions, and NGOs. Seed is disseminated through sales to other farmers and organisations, sharing, seed exchanges and payment for services. Challenges include unavailability of seed, under-developed markets, weak or non-existent linkages between seed suppliers and farmers, limited knowledge on seed production and marketing, and low market prices. Forage seed have comparatively higher gross margins (US$611.61 for mucuna and US$644.14 for cowpea) compared with conventional seed such as maize (-US$382.70). Opportunities arise from the growing demand for animal products, which is associated with expanding populations and the need for improved nutrition.

TI  - Governance of agricultural value chains: Coordination, control and safeguarding
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - The governance of agricultural value chains other than those that are export oriented has not been well understood. A case in point is agricultural value chains in India, which are characterized by the dominance of the informal sector, lack of standardization, and local policy dynamics. The complex interactions among actors in such value chains are not explained in the existing literature, which focuses on standardized, cross-border trade. The nature of coordination, control, and interdependence in local agricultural value chains is distinct, varies with the commodity, and is closer to a network system. A study of six commodity-specific sub-sectors, namely milk, rice, poultry meat, cotton, potato, and sugarcane, found that all consisted of relatively informal markets and were non-retailer-trader-driven. Governance of these value-chains is often riddled with overlapping and contradictory roles of actors. However, with the increasing trend of markets being controlled by organized players, a shift towards a buyer-driven market is expected in the future. In such a context, policy-makers should safeguard the interests of smallholder producers.

TI  - How to enhance the sustainability and inclusiveness of smallholder aquaculture production systems in Zambia?
T2  - AQUACULTURE
AB  - Fish is a key source of income, food, and nutrition in Zambia, although unlike in the past, capture fisheries no longer meet the national demand for fish. Supply shortfalls created an opportunity to develop the aquaculture sector in Zambia, which is now one of the largest producers of farmed fish (Tilapia spp.) on the continent. In its present form, the aquaculture sector exhibits a dichotomy. It comprises, on the one hand, a smallholder sector that mainly produces for and supplies within local markets, and on the other hand, a burgeoning larger-scale commercial sector consisting of a small number of pioneering lead firms who are (re)shaping how the value chain supplies domestic, mainly urban, markets. A notable challenge confronting the development of the aquaculture value chain in Zambia is ensuring that the larger-scale commercial sector can continue to grow and generate economic benefits for the country, while simultaneously safeguarding inclusive and sustainable growth of smallholder production systems. An in-depth, mixed-methods aquaculture value chain study was carried out in Zambia in 2017 that aimed at providing relevant stakeholders with pertinent information on the value chain's contribution to economic growth and its inclusiveness, as well as its social and environmental sustainability aspects. In this article, we present some key findings from the study to shed light on how the sustainability of smallholder production systems could be enhanced while preserving the growth trend of larger producers in an inclusive way. The study found that the value chain is contributing positively towards economic growth in the country. Smallholder farmers classified as "semi-subsistence" and "commercial" face several albeit somewhat different constraints to production, thus influencing their "sustainability" status. Semi-subsistence smallholders achieve positive (yet negligible) profit margins, and their production system is not environmentally sustainable and the value chain that supports them performs sub-optimally on several social markers. The "commercial" smallholder system is more economically viable and environmentally sustainable. The study juxtaposes these findings with those from the analysis of larger pond and cage-based systems to point to a set of key options Government, research, and development organisations could consider to support smallholder farmers and enhance the sustainability of the semi-subsistence smallholder production system in particular, without overlooking the whole system.

TI  - Multi-stakeholder platforms for linking small farmers to value chains: evidence from the Andes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Value chains linked to urban markets and agro-industry present new opportunities for adding value and raising rural incomes. Small farmers, who produce small volumes, struggle to enter these markets. A lack of trust among value chain actors increases transaction costs and short-circuits innovation. This paper explores how multi-stakeholder platforms have been used to address these problems in potato-based value chains in Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador. It uses the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework to understand how platforms work. Differences in characteristics of the value chains, the participating actors and institutional arrangements have led to the emergence of two types of platforms. The first type brings traders, processors, supermarkets and others together with farmer associations and research and development (R&D) organizations to foster the development of new market opportunities through commercial, institutional and technological innovation. The second type is structured around geographically delimited supply areas, meshing farmers and service providers to address market governance issues in assuring volumes, meeting quality and timeliness constraints and empowering farmers. Evidence from these cases indicates that platforms that bring stakeholders together around value chains can result in new products, processes, norms and behaviours that benefit poor farmers, which could not have been achieved otherwise.

TI  - Large investments, small farmers: A financialisation perspective on value chains in a development corridor
T2  - DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB  - Development corridors have recently gained momentum as territorial tools to attract flows of global capital into agricultural value chains. As this includes the controversial blending of public with private funding for investments into farmland, the integration of smallholders in large-scale operations is increasingly promoted as legitimatory practice. With this article, we discuss the role of finance in shaping such value chain arrangements. Using a spatially sensible financialisation perspective, we present two investment cases that have touched ground as reaction to the promotion of the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT). We assess how finance unfolded along territorial (corridor region and investment origin) and relational (investment chain and value chain) spatialities, to scrutinise the tensions and fragile outcomes that were co-constituted by mixed financial and moral investment imperatives. This helps to understand whether, why, and with what consequences smallholders can benefit from corridor-related investments.

TI  - Environmental Factors Influencing the Sustenance of the Camel Milk Value Chain in Isiolo County, Northern Kenya
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
AB  - Dryland areas in northern Kenya experience challenges due to various factors, including environmental degradation associated with unstable weather conditions and climate change. These and related risks and stressors are threats to the sustenance of camel milk production for many of Kenya's northern communities. We conducted a study among the pastoral communities in Isiolo County whose principal source of livelihood is dependent on camel production. In this paper, we discuss the drivers of the environmental factors influencing the resilience and sustainability of the camel milk value chain in Isiolo County, northern Kenya. We analyzed (i) the internal factors that influence the system, which includes: the categories and economic contributions of livestock-based value chains, the occupation of the camel milk value chain micro players, and land-use practices in Isiolo County, and (ii) the external factors influencing the system: the climatic variability (2014-2017) and its effect on the camel milk value chain, and the vegetation condition index (VCI) indicating drought trends for Isiolo County (2002-2020). The study adopted a field survey through interviews with randomly selected households involved in the camel milk value chain by using a survey questionnaire and a survey guide for focus group discussions (FGD) and key informant interviews (KII). The results from the study showed camel milk as a dominant value chain among the livestock-based value chain products in Isiolo County, the variations in quantities of camel milk supplied due to changes in seasonality, and we show that the current system is not sustainable. We conclude with recommendations to establish a modernized camel milk value chain based on improved natural resources management for a resilient and sustainable system.

TI  - Chained to Development? Livelihoods and global value chains in the coffee-producing Toraja region of Indonesia
T2  - AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER
AB  - A popular rural development strategy in recent years has been through the adoption of what has been widely called a 'value chain approach', where improved linkages between small producers in underdeveloped rural communities and 'lead firms' constitute the foundations for development interventions. Whilst the global value-chain framework can deliver insights into the broad structural processes shaping livelihood possibilities, the adoption of value chains as a development strategy tends to disregard the complexity of smallholder livelihoods that shape poverty alleviation pathways in different contexts. The relationships between global value chains, development interventions, and rural livelihoods are explored in this article through a case study of smallholder coffee farming in the Toraja region of Indonesia. In this case, value-chain interventions in the coffee sector are unlikely to significantly contribute to improved rural welfare due to the diversified reality of local livelihoods, the nuances of how coffee production is embedded within Torajan culture and economy, and excellent prevailing market opportunities. The livelihood framework, therefore, provides an important corrective for the sometimes excessive optimism presented by advocates of a value-chain approach to rural development.

TI  - Production system innovation to ensure raw milk safety in small holder economies: the case of dairy complex in China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Food safety becomes an important issue in fast developing economies when a large growing market is supplied by many small producers through a prolonged supply chain. China is facing such a serious problem with its growing dairy market seeing serious food safety scandals. In this article, we examine a new organizational structure recently promoted by Chinese government, dairy complex, and its effects on farmers' behaviors related to safe production and the effectiveness of such behavior on the raw milk safety, using a joint production function under risk theoretical framework. Results show that farmers' production practices such as basic production environment and hygienic condition, disease prevention, and source and use of feed all contribute to the food safety of raw milk. Complex is an important factor contributing to farmers' adoption of such safety production practices, together with the supervision by government, production scale, contracts with processors, and price of raw milk. We, thus, found that dairy complex as an organization structure can influence the safety of raw milk indirectly through its impacts on farmers' production behaviors. Another important finding is that unsafe milk is a result of uncertainty when less strict production practice is used by risk lover producers, and the complexes work well for such farmers by pushing them to take more conservative safety measurements. This innovative production system can be a good measure for developing economies with similar small producer problems.

TI  - Building value chains for indigenous fruits: lessons from camu-camu in Peru
T2  - RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Governments and NGOs have enthusiastically promoted value chains for lesser-known indigenous fruits in the pursuit of poverty reduction and other development goals. This paper examines experiences in Peru in building the value chain for camu-camua fruit native to the Amazon that is in the process of being domesticated. We look at interventions to build the chain, the environment in which the chain operates, the implications of chain development on livelihoods, and prospects for future chain development. Information was collected from gray literature as well as from primary data from household and key informant interviews. The results of this study suggest that the emergence of the camu-camu chain has led to higher farm income without generating large trade-offs in livelihood activities or the environment. However, the results also demonstrate an unrealized potential to achieve greater impact at scale due to gaps in services and inputs, limited coordination among farmers and chain actors, and a risky business environment. Building value chains for lesser-known fruits will require more than a techo-managerial focus on smallholder production. Greater attention is required to build stronger public-private collaboration to expand and diversify markets, with particular attention on strengthening institutions and growing local markets for high-value products.

TI  - Global value chains and traditional supply chains: Evidence from Guatemala
T2  - DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW
AB  - Global value chains have been at the centre of recent research, but traditional supply chains have been given much less attention. However, quantitative data on both chain types is scarce. Therefore, it remains unclear how much smallholders, formal and informal sectors in traditional and global value chains contribute to gross domestic product (GDP), employment generation and income distribution. This article, by using a broad primary data set of 28 value chains in Guatemala, evidences that traditional chains contribute substantially to the national economy and that the income generated is much more equally distributed than in global value chains.

TI  - Killing the goose? The value chain for sorghum beer in Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The decision by the Government of Kenya in 2013 to increase tax revenue by imposing excise duty of 50 percent on sorghum beer resulted in economic losses for smallholders, the brewery, and the government itself because it effectively killed the value chain. In 2015, the government reversed the policy decision and reduced excise duty to 10 percent. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of this policy decision on the value chain, adaptation by growers and the brewery, and the rationale for this policy change and its reversal.
   Design/methodology/approach The author analyzes this episode using a conceptual framework derived from complex adaptive systems, focusing on four properties of such systems: sudden, endogenous shocks, interacting agents, and adaptation.
   Findings The author shows how the nature of politics in Kenya exposed the value chain to endogenous shocks as the result of conflicts between interacting agents, where smallholder farmer organizations were important for successful adaptation. Conflicts between development and political objectives in neo-patrimonial states are sources of complexity and uncertainty in smallholder value chains.
   Research limitations/implications Complex adaptive systems proved a useful framework to understand decision making by government and business actors in the value chain.
   Originality/value The paper applies a novel conceptual framework to the analysis of an important value chain in Kenya.

TI  - Sustaining Upgrading in Agricultural Value Chains? State-Led Value Chain Interventions and Emerging Bifurcation of the South Indian Smallholder Tea Sector
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The Global Value Chain (GVC) approach has emerged as a novel methodological device for analysing economic globalization and international trade. The suitability of the chain metaphor and strategies for moving up the ladder of GVCs ("upgrade") is widely echoed in international development agencies and public agencies in the Global South. Most of the existing GVC studies focus on new forms of firm-to-firm relationships and the role of lead firms and chain governance in defining upgrading opportunities. This paper examines the role of the state and local institutional initiatives in promoting upgrading in agricultural GVCs originating in rural areas of the Global South. The paper draws on research conducted in the South Indian smallholder tea sector. The paper argues that successful forms of state-led chain interventions not only contribute to upgrading of the smallholder-brought leaf factory strand of the GVC originating in the South Indian tea sector, but might also result in increasing bifurcation of smallholders integrated into high-margin markets through prominent bought leaf factories and a mass of "others" outside this tightly coordinated strand of the tea value chain.

TI  - Formal versus informal: Efficiency, inclusiveness and financing of dairy value chains in Indian Punjab
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Using a unique set of household-level data from the Indian state of Punjab, this paper assesses the performance and financing of dairy value chains at their upstream. We find co-existence of formal value chains driven by dairy cooperatives and private processors including multinationals and informal value chains driven by vendors or local traders and consumer-households. The resource-rich dairy farmers prefer partnerships with private dairy processors or vice versa. The small dairy farmers are more dependent on informal channels for the sale of their produce. Although, there is no significant difference in milk yield across herd sizes and value chains, the farmers associated with cooperative value chain earn more profit. The findings also indicate the practice of scale-based price discrimination in the formal segment, especially by the multinationals. Further, more than half of the dairy farmers finance their dairying activities borrowing from the formal as well as informal sources. The chain-based financing is restricted to the value chains driven by the local traders and private domestic processors. The financing by commercial banks is limited and is biased in favour of resource-rich dairy farmers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping cassava food value chains in Tanzania's smallholder farming sector: The implications of intra-household gender dynamics
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - A gendered mapping of the structure and coordination (functioning) of traditional cassava value chains is important for marginalized groups such as women in rural development. In contrast to global high value chains, traditional food value chains and associated gender relations as well as power dynamics within households have received little attention. We conducted a cross sectional study in Kigoma, Mwanza, the coastal region, and Zanzibar Island in Tanzania. Data were collected through structured interviews conducted with 228 farmers, combined with key informant interviews, direct observations, repeated household visits, and literature review. The results of the study revealed that there are weak linkages within the cassava value chain, which is highly gendered. While production and processing nodes of the chain, which commenced from villages, were dominated by women and children, women were not well-integrated within high value nodes such as marketing in urban areas and cross-border trading, which were dominated by men. Transportation of cassava to highly lucrative markets was also dominated by men. Cassava processing was conducted at the household level as well as within small-scale cooperatives, with the major portion of this work being done by women. Supporting institutions were found to be involved in the supply of planting material, training, and the provision of processing equipment. In general, men played a prominent role in the control of resources, marketing, and income. In conclusion, the mapping of cassava value chains could help to identify avenues for understanding of poverty, enhancing food security, upgrading capacities, reducing gender inequality, and enhancing women's participation in marketing and income control in the cassava value chains.

TI  - Factors determining upland farmers' participation in non-timber forest product value chains for sustainable poverty reduction in Vietnam
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The development of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) plays an active role in overall economic development and is considered a new direction for sustainable forestry development to help people escape poverty. From micro data collected by a survey of poor, rural households living in the mountainous region of Central Vietnam, a structural equation model (SEM) incorporating the six factors of household head characteristics, household characteristics, reputation statuses of households, forest characteristics, willingness to participate in NTFP value chains, and financial effects of NTFP value chains was established. An empirical study of the effects of farmers' behaviors on NTFP financial value chains was also conducted. The results showed that household head characteristics, household characteristics, reputation statuses of households, and forest characteristics were positively correlated with people's willingness to participate in NTFP value chains and increase the financial efficiency of the value chains. However, each factor has a different level of influence. Additional empirical factors affecting farmers' awareness of poverty reduction policies were investigated. It was found that the more farmers understand sustainable poverty reduction policies, the more willing they are to participate in the value chains. The willingness to participate in the value chains strongly affects the financial performances of the value chains. Farmers are expected to be willing to fulfill their obligations and their enthusiasm for participating in the value chains has increased the financial efficiency of the value chains. In the future, the government can cooperate with official financial institutions, policy finance institutions, and local rural intermediaries to increase public financial knowledge, poverty reduction policies and projects in poor areas, and the participation of poor farmers, as well as solve their credit problems. Meanwhile, in developing a financial model of new NTFP value chains, more attention should be paid to the needs of farmers and this model should be built with the aim of the sustainable development of NTFP value chains.

TI  - Beyond the 'Field of Dreams' model in smallholder forestry: Building viable timber value chains for smallholder tree growers in developing countries
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Many smallholder tree growers in developing countries and those advising them, hold a view that if they plant trees a market will materialize when the time is right. However, despite strong international demand for timber and potential for smallholders to supply this demand, this 'Field of Dreams' approach, i.e. if you grow it, buyers will come, is not generally a sound strategy. In this study, we aimed to identify the conditions that enable the development of viable timber value chains around smallholder tree growers in developing countries. We reviewed literature on the integration of small-scale producers into value chains, smallholder tree growing, and smallholder commercial forestry to identify conditions, and used four case studies in the Asia-Pacific Region to understand how these influence outcomes for smallholder tree growers in different settings. This analysis provided a basis for recommendations for policymakers and advising agencies on how to support timber value chains for smallholder tree growers. These included deeper understanding of biophysical suitability of locations for tree growing, smallholder capabilities and interests, and provision of clear land tenure, infrastructure, and streamlined regulations sympathetic to smallscale timber operations. Tree growing can generate financial value for smallholders in regions with high human population density, quality road networks and proximity to processing markets and ports. Careful policy design is required to make it 'fit for purpose' at local levels, as conditions vary widely even within a single country. This can identify catalytic interventions and work with existing or near-term market drivers and simplified regulations in the value chain to generate benefits for smallholders.

TI  - Value chain analysis of tomato: The case of Bure, Jabitehinan and North Mecha districts of Amhara regional state, Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH
AB  - Ethiopia is still in the early stages of implementing agricultural value chains in general, and the tomato value chain in particular. Tomato production in Bure, Jabitehinan, and North Mecha Districts has played a critical role in generating income and creating jobs for many smallholder farmers, resulting in poverty reduction. Tomato growers, on the other hand, faced numerous challenges, including lack of clear tomato value chain depiction, poor product value addition, frail value chain linkage, and the perishable nature of the crop itself. As a result of these issues, tomato growers experienced low product prices, a lack of market information, and market inefficiencies, all of which limited the potential benefit of tomato value chain actors. Therefore, this study was aimed to mapping tomato value chain actors, their roles and linkages; to identify the major tomato market channels, and analyzing the structure, conduct and performance (S-C-P) of tomato value chain in the selected districts. Data were collected from both primary and secondary sources. Primary data were collected from randomly selected 280 tomato producers and 60 traders. To improve the validity of the data, the researchers were used focus group discussion and key informant interview in two rounds with a total size of 10 participants per discussion and secondary data were included from published articles and unpublished district reports. A multi-stage random sampling procedure was applied to select tomato producers and random sampling for traders. Descriptive statistics was applied to analyze data and generate valuable information on market structure, conduct and performance of tomato value chain. The survey result shows that input suppliers, producers, rural collectors, retailers, wholesaler, processors and consumers were identified as core tomato value chain actors. From the survey result, only 40.7% of the total respondents stated that tomato value addition was implemented and practiced. The perishability nature of the product and the low value addition practice of producers were led to less beneficiary in the tomato value chain. Processors obtained 44.82% of the profit share, which is the highest amount of profit share among other tomato value chain actors. Result from analysis of market concentration indicated that tomato market characterized by oligopolistic market structure with the buyers' concentration ratio of 45.53%. Market conduct shows that 73.21% of the price of tomato was set by traders while producers were price taker. Regarding to the market performance analysis, the highest TGMM was registered in channel X which accounts the estimated percentage share of 75% of consumer price. This study recommended that the decision maker should take-up initiative for strengthening of tomato value chain performance by capacitating farmer association to increase their bargaining power and supporting actors involved in local tomato markets. In addition, it is recommended that the government of the region should developed a policy that reduce oligopolistic tendency of market structure so as to create competitive tomato market environment for all actor in the market.

TI  - Agricultural value chain development in Nepal: Understanding mechanisms for poverty reduction
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This analysis investigates the potential mechanisms and the practical significance of agricultural value chain development in a geographically challenging rural area of a developing country. Using data from a carefully designed primary survey administered in a hill and mountainous region in Western Nepal, we show that linking small-scale producers to regional and local traders can help increase income. Analysis of impact pathways shows that the positive impact on household income emerges through higher agricultural income, driven by higher sale volume at lower prices. Focusing on high value commodities in rural areas, where arable land is not always fully exploited or utilized, appears to lead to acreage expansion and some crop switching, contributing to higher supply albeit at lower prices. The positive impact on household income is practically significant; it helps improve household food security and asset accumulation. These findings are robust to alternative specifications. Targeted value chain interventions that strengthen and stabilize small-scale producers' access to markets can contribute to rural poverty reduction via increase in agricultural income.

TI  - ANALYSING CHALLENGES FACING SMALLHOLDER FARMERS AND CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE IN SOUTH AFRICA: A SYSTEM DYNAMICS APPROACH
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES
AB  - Smallholder farmers in South Africa find it challenging to participate in the modern economy. Most of these farmers have limited access to credit and insurance, and to markets in which to sell their produce. This paper reviews ethnographic research data and argues that smallholder farmers struggle to take part in modern agricultural value chains in South Africa. System dynamics modelling is used to understand the dynamics relating to agricultural value-chain participants, and to determine whether the ethnographic research data is sufficient to answer the question as to which value-chain participants potentially have the largest impact on smallholder farmers. The modelling results show that banks may have the potential to trigger an impact on smallholder farmers' productivity that could then attract other value-chain industries to take part in efforts to support these farmers. Smallholder farmers could become a long-term viable and sustainable option for increasing food security in South Africa. However, this study has its limitations. The data used from existing ethnographic research, conducted by way of semi-structured interviews with value-chain participants, is limited and is not able to answer questions such as: (i) how much each industry is prepared to engage with smallholder farmers in the event of other industries being prepared to do the same; and (ii) how long it will take each industry to react to a willingness to engage. Ongoing research is required to extend the interviewee base and data in order to answer these questions and for the model to be completed and used for policy guidance.

TI  - Impact of value chain participation on household food insecurity among smallholder vegetable farmers in Swayimane KwaZulu-Natal
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB  - South Africa has largely been characterized as food secure at the national level but food insecure at a household level. This paper explores the impact of value chain participation on food insecurity among smallholder farmers in Swayimane KwaZulu-Natal. Purposive sampling technique was used to sample 51 smallholder vegetable farmers who were value chain participants at various levels. The study uses the Household Food Insecurity Access scale (HFIAS) and the Instrumental Variable Poisson model to assess the household food security status and the factors that influence the food security status among the smallholder farmers. The results show that 66.7% of the farmers in the sample were food secure, 17.65% were mildly food insecure, 7.84% were moderately food insecure and 7.84% were severely food insecure. Value chain participation, age of the household head, marital status, formal education, farm income, lease rent on land, access to NGOs, access to agricultural agency, access to credit, access to television, access to extension services and access to an irrigation scheme were significant in impacting household food insecurity. The study concluded that participation in value chains was significant in reducing food insecurity among smallholder farmers in Swayimane and therefore, strategies focusing on enhancing value chain participation among farmers should be adopted along with interventions that enhance value chain participation among smallholder farmers. As empirically posited by the results of this study, the more households are involved in the vegetable value chain, the better the household food intake and food security they become.

TI  - Understanding the Coula edulis, Dacryodes buettneri and Irvingia gabonensis non-timber forest product value chains from Makokou, North-East Gabon from a gender perspective
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - Trade-in Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) in the Congo Basin is a source of cash income for stakeholders in their value chains, from harvesters to traders. However, gender-disaggregated data on the benefits of such trade in Gabon remains poorly captured and used by policymakers, despite a decree on women's empowerment enacted by the Republic of Gabon in 2017. This study assesses gender dynamics, reasons for entering the trade, economics, and perceived threats to Coula edulis, Dacryodes buettneri, and Irvingia gabonensis value chains originating in Makokou, Gabon. Data from field observations, key informants, and 79 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in three markets showed that activities in the value chains of these three NTFPs were highly gender-differentiated. Women dominate in all three chains, particularly in the two lower-value products. This was driven by women's vulnerability and men's preference for higher-value timber and NTFPs. Both men and women enter the trade mostly because they lack other ways to generate income and employment. The men involved in the chains tended to harvest slightly larger volumes and sell at higher prices. The NTFPs and their value chains were all perceived as threatened by climate change, deforestation, and unsustainable forest resources management, with both men and women aware of these threats. The importance of the NTFP trade for women suggested that policies and gender focus interventions, for example on domestication, cultivation, value-adding to improve and sustain their income, could contribute to more sustainable value chains and livelihoods.

TI  - Bringing more value to small farmers: a study of potato farmers in Pakistan
T2  - MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB  - Purpose Small farmers, being the primary producers of crops, are the key players in the food supply chain. Yet, they remain the most marginalized in the value chain. The marginalization of small farmers can affect food sustainability. The purpose of this paper is to identify opportunities for bringing more value to small farmers in an agricultural value chain. Design/methodology/approach This paper makes use of action research, studying the potato value chain, in a developing agricultural country Pakistan. The authors conducted an in-depth study of 37 farmers in four regions, each being a large potato growing ecosystem. The study examined the end-to-end decision-making processes, sources of input (both physical and information), cultivation and sales practices, cost structure, productivity and profitability of the farmers in potato farming. Findings Large variations exist in the crop yield, cost structure and profitability of farmers within each of and among the four regions due to differences in cultivation practices and approach to sales. There is a significant potential to lower costs, increase yield and enhance overall profitability by using the existing better processes. By addressing the issues faced by small farmers their profits can be potentially doubled. The paper also discusses potential means of recrafting and streamlining the value chain to bring more value to small farmers. Research limitations/implications The paper provides a detailed account of how different interventions can increase the value for small farmers. Since the current food supply chain and sustainability are under stress, worldwide, the findings of this study have implications for farmers as well as policy makers. Originality/value The literature on streamlining the agricultural value chain and enhancing the share of small farmers is scarce. Improving the value chain and reducing the marginalization of small farmers is an essential step toward increasing food sustainability.

TI  - The Future of Smallholder Farming in India: Some Sustainability Considerations
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The biodiverse, predominantly crop-livestock mixed-farming in India is key to ensuring resilience to climate change and sustainability of smallholder farming agroecologies. Farmers traditionally grow diverse crops as polyculture, and agriculture is mainly organic/biodynamic with spirituality in food systems deeply ingrained. Job-driven out-migration of rural youths, the family labor force, and globalization of contemporary food choices under corporate industrial agriculture both adversely affect sustainability of traditional farming landscapes and compromise the nutrition and health of rural farming communities. Besides documenting information on general agri-food system policy inputs, our paper presents the results of an exploratory study of four crucial community-level initiatives conducted in four distinct agroecological landscapes of India, aimed at bringing sustainability to traditional farming and food systems. The driving force for fundamental change in agri-food system, and in society, is the question of sustainability. The organic and local food movements are but specific phases of the larger, more fundamental sustainable agri-food movement. While it is very critical to increase farmer livelihood, it is even more important to increase overall rural economy. It was found that four important interventions viz. linking organic agriculture to community-supported agriculture (CSA) initiatives; linking small-holder farming to school meal (MDM) programmes; enhanced market access and value chain development for local agricultural produce; and creation of employment opportunities at community level for rural youths and reducing over-dependence of rural population on agriculture as source of income can make traditional farming more profitable and sustainable. The transition to more sustainable methods of farming by selling the farm produce "locally" helps both consumers and farmers alike and is considered a future strength of smallholder Indian agriculture.

TI  - Value Chain Development and the Agrarian Question: Actor Perspectives on Native Potato Production in the Highlands of Peru
T2  - RURAL SOCIOLOGY
AB  - Value chain development seeks to integrate smallholder farmers into competitive markets to promote economic and social development. This article, conceptually based on the agrarian question, considers how the perspectives of various value chain actors, with particular focus on smallholders, have important implications for the outcomes of these market-oriented initiatives. Utilizing Long's concept of social interface, we present a mixed-methods case study that analyzes how smallholders, an NGO, and agrifood corporations, including PepsiCo, partnered to establish value chains for native potatoes in the Peruvian highlands. We find that a thorough understanding of the various perspectives held by value chain actors provides important insight into why value chain initiatives have divergent trajectories. Based on the findings, we conclude that accounting for how actors are responding to development initiatives and one another helps explain development outcomes and that therefore the agrarian question remains relevant in current agricultural development discourse and practice.

TI  - Welfare effects of small-scale farmers' participation in apple and mango value chains in Ethiopia
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - This study examines the effects of participation in the fruit value chain on small-scale farmers' economic welfare in Ethiopia's Upper-Blue Nile Basin, focusing on apple and mango crops. This household economic welfare is measured by the consumption expenditure approach. Primary data were collected from a random sample of 384 households, 211 of which are fruit value chain participants and the rest are non-participants. The endogenous switching regression model was used to control for selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity. The study finds that the more apple and mango farmers join the value chain, the higher their consumption expenditure becomes. On average, the apple and mango value chain participation increased household consumption expenditure by about 17% and 18.5%, respectively. Overall, the results indicate a positive economic welfare effect of small-scale farmer participation. Hence, supporting small-scale farmers is imperative and a reasonable policy approach to improve their economic welfare in rural Ethiopia.

TI  - Value-Chains in the Andes: Upgrading for Ecuador's Blackberry Producers
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We apply a value chain approach to examine how blackberry producers in Ecuador can improve production and marketing practices to obtain more favorable prices. Results show that general upgrading actions are associated with improved producer prices, and specific activities, such as seeking information from reputable sources can lead to substantial welfare improvements. The paper goes beyond most value chain studies which treat participation in a 'modern' value chain as a discrete state. Ecuador's blackberry industry is evolving incrementally with no clearly discernible 'modern' market chains. Instead, producers incrementally make improvements in multiple dimensions. Relatively low-cost practices, many of which do not imply substantial risk or investment, are associated with price improvements. Obstacles to participation in incremental value chain upgrading activities are not insurmountable. In particular, scale of production is not a limiting factor: small-scale producers are not precluded from adopting improved practices and they do not suffer in terms of price received.

TI  - Beyond the vertical? Using value chains and governance as a framework to analyse private standards initiatives in agri-food chains
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - The significance of private standards and associated local level initiatives in agri-food value chains are increasingly recognised. However whilst issues related to compliance and impact at the smallholder or worker level have frequently been analysed, the governance implications in terms of how private standards affect national level institutions, public, private and non-governmental, have had less attention. This article applies an extended value chain framework for critical analysis of Private Standards Initiatives (PSIs) in agrifood chains, drawing on primary research on PSIs operating in Kenyan horticulture (Horticulture Ethical Business Initiative and KenyaGAP). The paper explores the legislative, executive and judicial aspects of governance in these southern PSIs highlighting how different stakeholders shape debates and act with agency. It is argued that governance is exercised 'beyond the vertical' in that one can identify wider horizontal processes of governance, including how the scope of key debates is constructed (especially in legislative governance) but analysis of executive governance emphasises the dominant role of the lead buyers.

TI  - Qualitative analysis of the risks and practices associated with the spread of African swine fever within the smallholder pig value chains in Uganda
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - A study was undertaken between September 2014 and December 2014 to assess the perceptions of smallholder pig value chain actors of the risks and practices associated with the spread of African swine fever (ASF) disease within the pig value chains. Data was collected from 136 value chain actors and 36 key informants through 17 group discussions and two key informant interview (KID sessions respectively using Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools.
   Results from this study revealed that according to value chain actors and stakeholders, the transporting, slaughtering, and collecting/bulking nodes represent the highest risk, followed by the inputs and services (feeds and drugs) supply nodes. The processing, whole sale and consumption nodes represented the lowest risk. Value chain actors are aware of the disease and its consequences to the pig industry, however biosecurity measures are poorly implemented at all nodes. As for the causes, value chain actors pointed to several factors, such as inadequate knowledge of mechanisms for the spread of the disease, poor enforcement of regulations on disease control, and low capacities of actors to implement biosecurity measures, amongst others. Although traders, butchers and veterinary practitioners accepted that they played an important role in the spread of the virus, they did not perceive themselves as key actors in the control of the disease; instead, they believed that only farmers should adopt biosecurity measures on their farms because they keep the pigs for a longer period. Most of the recommendations given by the value chain actors for controlling and preventing ASF disease were short term, and targeted mainly pig producers. These recommendations included: the establishment of live pig collection centres so that traders and brokers do not have to directly access pig farms, capacity building of value chain actors on application of biosecurity, enactment and enforcement of by-laws on live pig movements and establishment of operational outbreak reporting mechanism at district level. Long term recommendations included the development of a vaccine, as well as pen-side diagnostic tests. This study suggests that interventions to control ASF disease through application of biosecurity measures should target all value chain nodes, while putting more emphasis on post-farm nodes especially the trading.

TI  - Linking climate forecasts to rural livelihoods: Mapping decisions, information networks and value chains
T2  - WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES
AB  - Climate variability is a key source of livelihood risks faced by smallholder farmers in drier environments in many developing countries. Climate information provided on seasonal time-scales can sometimes improve agricultural decision-making. However, there are many barriers to the effective dissemination, communication and use of such information on farm and across the value chain. We used a case study in southern India to explore ways of overcoming some of these barriers such as those limiting access to information and effective communication of probabilistic forecast information. Firstly, we used social network analysis at the village level to identify particular individuals, groups or/and institutions who are central in information networks so as to be able to support them to increase the efficiency, effectiveness, equity and robustness of information transfers. This allowed us to identify potential opportunities and challenges around access, communication and forecast use. Close linking of formal and informal networks appeared to be a common, positive influencing factor. Secondly, we used value chain analysis to assess how pre-and post-farm decision-makers could use seasonal climate forecasts (SCF) in their own businesses and how this may propagate up and down the value chain. We found that the motivation for using SCF varied across the value chain and was likely of limited use to smaller, off-farm value chain players who take a short-term adaptive management approach to planning. However, it was seen as having significant potential for larger businesses who take a more strategic approach. This identified a possible risk of increased competitive inequality between businesses of different sizes. Thirdly, we addressed the challenge of translating probabilistic climate forecast information into support for decision making by using decision analysis with intermediaries enabling them to structure clearly problems with embedded climate probabilities. The construction of decision-trees enabled farm advisers and local researchers to explore the potential value of SCF by using the decision trees as a "boundary object" around which farmers and other decision makers, agricultural scientists, climate scientists, economists, social scientists and policy-makers could have thoughtful discussion leading to useful strategies to better manage climate risk. This paper outlines approaches and outcomes associated with these three activities as a way of exploring effective application of seasonal climate information and identifies additional research to enhance applicability.

TI  - Value chain analysis of potato in Farta District of South Gondar Zone, Amhara National Regional State of Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Potatoes are the worlds most important root and tuber crop. It is grown in over 125 countries and consumed by over a billion people daily. Millions of people in impoverished countries rely on potatoes product to their survival. Today, developing countries are the worlds major producers and distributors of potatoes and potato products. Potato can be effective produce for allowing smallholder families to achieve their food security. Ethiopia has probably the maximum prospective country for potato production. However, in Ethiopia, various factors influence potato production and commercialization. It is the main tuber crop produced in Earta District. Potato production and value chain status are not studied well. Hence the main aim of this study was to evaluate the value chains of potatoes in the Farta district, Ethiopia. 123 sample potato farmers were chosen using a two-stage random sampling technique in four kebeles. Descriptive, inferential, value chain approach and econometrics analysis were employed. In addition, Heckman's two-stage selection econometrics model was employed to analyze the determinants of potato market participation and sales quantity. Producers, traders, chain supports, chain enablers, and final consumers were the main value chain actors for potato in the study area. Wholesalers control the potato value chain due to their finances advantage. Probit model estimation result provides that: distance to the nearby market, family size, oxen owned by farmers, market information, land size allocated for potato production, and quantity of inorganic fertilizer were the significant variables affecting the decision to market participation positively except family sire. The OLS estimation result provides that: the education level of the farmers, farming experience, the number of extension contact, the land size allocated for potatoes, and the quantity of inorganic fertilizer is the significant variables influencing the amount of potato market supply positively. The main constraints for potato production and commercialization in study area were: Shortage of improved seed, lack of capacity building training to the post-harvest management approach, price fluctuation, shortage of market information, absence of policy framework in price-setting strategy was produced and marketing constraints of potatoes. Therefore, the study suggests that; increasing access to farm inputs, introducing new and improved crop varieties, establishing suitable post-harvest management facilities. In addition, follow up misconduct practice for price-setting strategies, strengthening market information service, facilitating conditions that can promote the smallholder farmers for participating in the market and minimize those constraints which impede the complete value chain in potato production and development.

TI  - The Windmill Approach Combining transaction cost economics and farming systems theory to analyse farmer participation in value chains
T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - A common theoretical approach for understanding smallholder farmers' choice of sales arrangements is transaction cost economics (TCE), which usually focuses on a single transaction. However, farmers produce different crops and participate in several value chains simultaneously. Based on two case studies in central Mozambique, the authors propose an analytical framework that pays attention to both the production and the transaction strategies of farmers. This Windmill Approach acknowledges that farmers decide on participating in various value chains on the basis of multiple objectives and aspirations. Farmers prioritize the allocation of available resources towards the sustainability of the whole farm. Policy to support smallholder farmers' market access should not focus on single transactions, but on the combination of farming system and value chain costs and benefits.

TI  - Analysis of smallholder pig value chains in Ghana
T2  - DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE
AB  - This article examines the pig value chain in the Kassena Nankana East District of Ghana using data from 108 pig value chain actors. The empirical results revealed that the pig value chain actors added a considerable amount of value, of which processors added the highest value. Processors were perceived to be the most important actors in the governance of the value chain with respect to profit and bargaining power, whereas the producers governed the value chain in terms of information concentration and protection from competition. The results have key policy implications for the production and marketing of pigs in Ghana.

TI  - Broiler production in South Africa: Is there space for smallholders in the commercial chicken coup?
T2  - DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB  - It is agreed that agriculture provides avenues for impoverished households to produce and trade their way out of poverty. However, this requires market access and value chain integration of small-scale farmers. This paper explores the possibilities for integration of small-scale farmers into the mainstream commercial broiler value chain in South Africa. Production costs of small-scale producers are evaluated within the context of their commercial counterparts, with a case study approach. It revealed that small-scale producers pay more for inputs but also receive a substantial premium for sales of live birds in the informal market. This results in attractive gross margins for small-scale producers. There is, however, a production ceiling, due to demand and production considerations, associated with small-scale broiler production. This ultimately results in a dualistic industry with an informal (live sale) value chain at the one end of the spectrum and a sophisticated large-scale commercial value chain at the other. Given the salient production features and investment requirements associated with large-scale broiler production, organic growth from the small-scale value chain into the commercial value chain seems improbable. The dual nature of this industry should therefore be considered when developing policy geared towards development, poverty alleviation and value chain integration.

TI  - Telephone farmers and an emerging ecosystem are unlocking the hidden middle of agricultural value chains in Kenya through innovation
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose This article explores the potential of an emerging group of farmers in Kenya, namely the growing segment of urban-based medium-size farmers, often called "telephone farmers". To what extent do they benefit from an emerging ecosystem to support them in operating their farms, and what does that mean for the Hidden middle of agricultural value chains, the actors between the farmers and consumers? Unlocking the potential production of telephone farmers will require more services from collectors, traders, transport firms, the storage facilities, wholesalers and processing units and retailers. Ultimately, optimized telephone farm production benefits the business of Hidden middle value chain actors, increases incomes and jobs and improves food security. Design/methodology/approach Based on a survey and in-depth interviews a profile of the telephone farmers is given and their role as innovators is analyzed. The Latia Resource Centre (LRC) provides assistance to medium-size farmers, like the telephone farmers, helping them to prepare business plans and use modern technology and contributing to an emerging ecosystem providing support to all farmers. Findings The article analyzes the medium-size telephone farmers. It documents the contributions of this new agricultural actor to developing value chains and a dynamic ecosystem. The paper profiles the telephone farmers first and then identifies what they need and the support they receive. The emerging innovative ecosystem impacts agricultural productivity and production and hence the development of value chains. Small farmers gain access to opportunities offered by telephone farmers, working for them as outgrower or farm worker. Research limitations/implications The authors used a small sample of 51 farmers and covered only a two-year period. Social implications Small farmers are being helped through the emerging eco-system and farm labor acquire skills, which they can also you on another or their own farm. Originality/value Based on the analysis an even more effective ecosystem is suggested and policy recommendations are formulated before the conclusion is drawn that these medium-size farmers contribute to innovation diffusion, inclusive value chain development and food security and are becoming part of this expanding, innovative ecosystem. Following the debate on food security the results suggest to pay more attention to the development of telephone farmers given their role in developing agricultural value chains and innovative ecosystems.

TI  - OVERCOMING SMALL HOLDER FARMERS' FINANCIAL EXCLUSION USING ANCHOR BORROWERS' PROGRAMME IN YOLA NORTH AND YOLA SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS, ADAMAWA STATE, NIGERIA
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Rural areas in Nigeria are the centres of agriculture-based economic activity and fuel the livelihoods of 70% and contribute over 22.30% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It is estimated that Nigerian agricultural output would increase if farmers were able to access the finance they need to expand both the quality and quantity of their produce. The limited level of Agricultural credit is considered an important factor for increased agricultural production and food security because, it enhances productivity and promotes standard of living by breaking the vicious cycle of poverty of small scale farmers. The study was conducted on Overcoming Small holder Farmers' Financial Exclusion using Anchor Borrowers' Programme in Yola North and Yola South Local Government Areas, Adamawa State, Nigeria. Data were collected using structured on 94 farmers randomly selected. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in the analysis of the data collected. Descriptive analysis revealed that respondents were relatively young with a mean age of 40 years, a mean family size of 6 people who are mostly small holder farmers with the mean farm size of 3.21 hectares and are experienced with a mean experience of 10 years. Logit result with Diagnostic statistics and VIF test results indicated that the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test indicating that our model fits the data well. The model also correctly predicted 73.68 % of the dependent variables. The estimated VIF suggested that the explanatory variables specified in the model do not cluster together or exhibit multicollinearity tendencies. This implies that the estimates of the model to an appreciable extent are consistent and unbiased, stable over time and there was also no problem of multicollinearity. Furthermore, the result showed that membership of cooperative society, age, primary occupation, income and training were statistically significant and increases the probability of access to agricultural credit. Government policies that would encourage young people to go into agriculture should be sustained by the government at all levels in areas of credit supply, training and supply of basic production inputs to boost production, increase food security and reduction in poverty. Farmers should be encouraged to form cooperative societies to maximize the economics of scale.

TI  - GENDER INFLUENCE ON PARTICIPATION IN CASSAVA VALUE CHAINS IN SMALLHOLDER FARMING SECTORS: EVIDENCE FROM KIGOMA REGION, TANZANIA
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
AB  - When the agricultural value chain involves profit making, it results in changes in the production and distribution relationships among men and women in terms of access to and control of markets, resources and benefits emanating from product value chain participation. This affects not only individual incomes but also gender equality. This study examined gender relationships in the cassava value chain in the Kigoma region of Tanzania. The aim was to assess gender participation in the cassava value chain. Multi-stage sampling was used to select the respondents in four districts. A structured questionnaire was administered to 384 randomly selected household heads. A chi-square test was used to test for significant relationships among the variables. Results indicated that gender was significantly related to socio-economic characteristics. About 34% of the women participating in the cassava value chain were young, some below 17 years of age. There were significant relationships between gender and access to resources (land, extension services and markets), control over resources (land, house and household assets) and benefits (revenue) generated from cassava value chains. Overall, there was gender disparity in participation along the cassava value chain. These results suggest that any intervention in the cassava value chain should consider gender relations to benefit men and women and alleviate household poverty.

TI  - Forging alliances: Coffee grower and chain leader partnerships to improve productivity and coffee quality in Papua New Guinea
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC VIEWPOINT
AB  - Partnership discourse is making advances in development dialogue as a means to improve the livelihoods of the agrarian populace. In Papua New Guinea, productive partnerships flourished during the early growth of the coffee industry. After the demise of plantations and rural mills in the lead up to political independence, the support services that plantations used to provide to smallholders, including centralised processing, have ceased as have price incentives for quality. Consequently, smallholders began to produce coffee of inconsistent quality and their productivity has also declined. However, coffee value chain partnerships have the potential to reverse the present decline of coffee production and increase the productivity of coffee farmers and address the inconsistency and the supply of low-grade coffee. Using two case studies of farmer cooperatives, we investigate collective action and also assess partnerships among present value chain actors. The case studies were supported with interviews of value chain actors to gain further insights into partnerships with farmer groups. This paper illustrates that through collective action and partnerships, coffee farmers can improve coffee production and quality, enhance governance systems in grower groups, attract community development services and diversify into other entrepreneurial activities.

TI  - Landscapes of Social Inclusion: Inclusive Value-Chain Collaboration Through the Lenses of Food Sovereignty and Landscape Governance
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Value-chain collaboration (VCC) aims to increase smallholder productivity and market integration. Higher productivity, better incomes and innovations have been documented, but also exclusionary trends and loss of biological and dietary diversity. New forms of VCC 'beyond the chain' hope to tackle this through collaboration with non-chain actors. Drawing on territorially embedded VCC, food sovereignty and landscape governance theories, this article presents a conceptual framework to analyse whether and how inclusive VCC, greater farmer autonomy and sustainable landscapes can be achieved. Key elements of our approach are knowledge of smallholders' various livelihood trajectories and selective value-chain engagement; multi-stakeholder definition of the sustainability choice space; and smallholder inclusion in adaptive learning and empowerment processes that bring together and integrate different and oft-competing knowledge systems and governance levels. This approach will support further action research in learning platforms in Ghana and South Africa. The article discusses the link with the broader inclusive development debate.

TI  - Gender differentials in value addition and lean season market participation in the grasshopper value chain in Uganda
T2  - FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY
AB  - Gender gaps in agrifood value chains are manifested in differential access to and control of productive resources, upgrading activities, market participation, farm productivity and food security among women and men. These gender gaps threaten economic development in sub-Saharan Africa. With low-resource requirements, edible insects have emerged as a promising agrifond value chain with income opportunities for women and men. However, it is not clear how gender gaps are manifested in the participation in value addition and lean season market of the edible insect value chain with a potential to improve household welfare. In this paper, we analyse the gender gaps of retailers' participation in value addition and lean season market in the grasshopper value chain in Uganda. Multivariate probit and tobit models are used in the empirical analyses. We find that women are 15% more likely to participate in primary value addition. However, there are no gender gaps in the participation in secondary value addition and the lean season market. The study also shows that grasshopper business is an important source of income for many retailers. Therefore, the development of the grasshopper value chain, especially the aspects of value addition and lean season market, could contribute to gender equality and improvement of livelihoods of women and men.

TI  - Promoting Food Safety in Local Value Chains: The Case of Vegetables in Vietnam
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Background: Food quality and safety concerns in low- and middle-income countries are often addressed using stringent standards and formal contracts between farmers and buyers. Many studies have investigated the welfare implications of these control mechanisms for small-scale farmers in modern value chains, including exports and supermarkets. Conversely, few studies have focused on the potential of certification and contracts to tackle food safety issues within local traditional value chains. Methods: This study uses a discrete choice experiment to explore the preferences of vegetable farmers (n = 301) in northern Vietnam for different types of certification schemes-including third-party certification and participatory guarantee systems-and contracts. Results: Farmers are willing to accept a 49% lower price per kilogram for their vegetables to enter into a contract with a buyer, provided that pesticide use restrictions are feasible and the buyer is fully committed and trustworthy. However, they are strongly averse to organic farming, as they would require a 40% premium per kilogram to produce organically. They would also request a 21% premium to accept selling to an unknown buyer. Farmers highly value contracts that entail large purchase quantities, long duration and pesticide provision. Although the estimated willingness-to-accept values may seem very large, they make sense in the context of highly perishable produce. Conclusion: Our findings urge both policy makers and researchers to not only focus on modern value chains but also on local traditional value chains to tackle food safety issues in low- and middle-income countries, as we show that farmers are willing to produce safe vegetables for the local market when trading with buyers under beneficial conditions.

TI  - Designing interventions in local value chains for improved health and nutrition: Insights from Malawi
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Despite the strong interest on the role of agri-food value chains in advancing health and nutrition goals, guidance on how to actually design and assess related development programming has only recently emerged. This paper begins with a brief review of research on nutrition-sensitive value chains in developing countries. It then presents the Value Chains and Nutrition framework for intervention design that explores food supply and demand conditions across a portfolio of local value chains that are relevant for improving nutrition outcomes. We explore the framework in a case study on rural Malawi. Available evidence highlights the dominance of maize in diets, but also the willingness of rural households to consume other nutritious foods (e.g. leafy greens, tree fruits, dried fish) during the year. Addressing the supply constraints (e.g. low productivity, seasonality) and demand constraints (e.g. low income, preference for maize) along local value chains will require carefully sequenced interventions within and across value chains. Strategies for achieving nutrition goals in this context will require stronger collaborative ties between NGOs, government agencies and the private sector and deeper learning among stakeholders than has typically been the case. We conclude with recommendations for future work on frameworks and tools for supporting the design of value chain interventions with potential to advance health and nutrition goals.

AB  - The commercial opportunities for sengon (Paraserianthes falcataria L. Nielsen) are expanding rapidly in Indonesia, but there remains a lack of supply for the processing industry of the desired volume and quality of timber for processing from this fast-grown tree. This article discusses recent analysis of the value chain of sengon in Indonesia to determine (i) who the stakeholders were and how each added value, and (ii) how the benefits were distributed among stakeholders. Information was collected from a mix of farmers (as tree growers) and other actors involved in the value chain. The research revealed two broad types of value chains for 'engon-`direct' and 'traditional', with the potential increased income for farmers being as high as 35% when they use the direct approach, compared to the traditional approach. As expected, the further 'downstream' the position of the stakeholder in the value chain, the greater the monetary value added to the sengon timber and subsequent products. If farmers were to acquire a greater understanding of the market dynamics for sengon, they could better target the sale of their forest products to specific market segments and make forestry a more profitable enterprise. While village traders in the traditional value chain play an important role connecting small-scale tree growers to commercial markets, the sustained viability of their role is uncertain if more farmers adopt the 'direct' approach.

TI  - Is contract farming an inclusive alternative to land grabbing? The case of potato contract farming in Maharashtra, India
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - In the recent explosion of attention given to the land grabbing phenomenon, contract farming has been identified as a potentially inclusive alternative for smallholders to outright acquisition of farm land by agri-business capital. This paper responds to these claims by resituating contract farming as an equally important form of land control. The focus of the paper is a case study of potato contract farming in Maharashtra, India. While there is 'nothing new' about contract farming as a mode of agriculture production in India, its influence on patterns of agrarian change is poorly understood. Adopting an agrarian political economy-informed livelihoods approach, the paper argues that rather than an inclusive alternative to land grabbing, contract farming in the study site represents another way that capital is coming to control land in rural India, with just as important implications for agrarian livelihoods. While some individual households have improved their livelihoods through participation, the contract scheme acts to reinforce already existing patterns of inequality. In particular, the unequal power relations between firm and farmer skew the capture of benefits towards the firm, and render participating households vulnerable to indebtedness and loss of autonomy over land and livelihood decisions.

TI  - Commercialization and upgrading in the aquaculture value chain in Zambia
T2  - AQUACULTURE
AB  - After decades of government and donor-run programs that sustained extensive aquaculture systems, Zambia has experienced market-led capital investments that have facilitated significant growth in production. The emerging commercial sector is characterized by investments in intensive cage and pond-based aquaculture of mostly nonnative tilapia species, which today makes up the bulk of annual production. To better understand this transformation we used a Global Value Chain (GVC) analysis to examine evidence of upgrading trajectories and various forms of coordination that govern the chain. A quantitative survey of smallholder farmers in Northern Province (n = 223) was designed to surface insights on the productivity of small-scale farmers and evaluate their position of strength within the chain. The survey reveals the extensive nature of rural, small-scale fish farming and suggests that farmers produce mostly for subsistence purposes and in isolation from the commercializing value chain. We also provide data from 22 key informant interviews with lead firms and stakeholders in the aquaculture sector to provide insights on upgrading and the forms of coordination between nodes and firms. Our findings show that upgrading in value chains is taking place in all its forms, i.e. through investments in high value products, improvements in operations that produce more efficiently, adopting upstream or downstream chain functions, and utilizing competencies from different chains into aquaculture-related operations. Much of this is possible because of increasing vertical integration of operations and tighter contractual relationships between firms and nodes. The value chain and markets in Zambia are thus dichotomized, where on one side there is an extensive smallholder sector, supported by government-run services, and little access to inputs and markets; and on the other side, a burgeoning commercial sector with a few pioneering lead firms who have shaped the commercial value chain and who dominate total production. Finally, we combined various government statistics to reveal the growing fish supply per capita rate between 2004 and 2014. We also provide data on fish imports to locate the Zambian aquaculture value chain in the larger global picture and present some insights into what many key informants in the industry feel is an increasing obstacle facing the sector. Analyzing upgrading and coordination trends is critical in understanding the emerging aquaculture value chains in sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Multi-stakeholder partnerships in value chain development: A case of the organic pineapple in Ntungamo district, Western Uganda
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that agricultural commodity value chain development using multi-stakeholder partnerships (MSPs) can fast-track improvement in the livelihoods of rural farming households. With the view that such partnerships can raise farmers' incomes, the study uses the case of the organic pineapple (OP) value chain in Ntungamo, Western Uganda, to understand the governance features that hold the value chain partners together, to analyse the costs and margins to the participating farmers, to identify opportunities for demand-driven upgrading of the farmers' skills and knowledge, and the role that partnerships play in such upgrading.
   Design/methodology/approach The study uses the qualitative tools of value chain analysis: value chain maps of stakeholders, processes and support services of the OP value chain, and a quantitative tool to analyse costs and margins to the participating farmers. Interviews were conducted with key informants from the OP innovation platform, and survey data collected for the planting season, February-July, 2014, across three farmer categories of certified organic, conventional, and farmers not participating in the innovation platform.
   Findings Careful selection of partnerships to develop the value chain is found to be critical. Partners to involve should be those that enable the upgrading of farmers' knowledge, skills and technologies to position them for better markets. Partners should also include those that enable the improvement of margins to the farmers and efficiency of the value chain. The strategic MSPs should be bound by formal contracts, to ensure stable relationships in the value chain and hence sustainable market access for the farmers.
   Research limitations/implications Although carried out on a specific value chain in a specific local context, this is not likely to limit the applicability of the findings to commodity value chains in a range of local contexts.
   Originality/value The study fulfils the need to highlight the role that stakeholder partnerships can play in value chain development and how they can be sustained by governance and institutional arrangements.

TI  - Use of Blue-Greenish Yellow Fluorescence Test on Feeds and Its Association with Aflatoxin M-1 Contamination in Bulk Tank Milk
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION
AB  - The objectives of this study were to use the blue greenish yellow fluorescence (BY) test for aflatoxin M-1 (AFM(1)) contamination in bulk milk and to examine the association between AFM(1) contamination and environmental and feed management factors. The study was conducted March to May of 2011 with samples from 82 small holder dairy farms belonging to a single dairy cooperative in Chiang Mai province, Thailand. On the day of milk sample collection, samples of all feed used for milking cows and data on feed characteristics, feed management, and environmental factors also were collected at each farm. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine AFM(1) concentrations in milk samples, and samples with AFM(1) concentrations above the limit of detection were considered AFM(1) contaminated. Fisher's exact tests were used to determine the association between AFM(1) contamination in milk and farm management factors, feed management factors, and fungal contamination in feeds (as determined with the BY test). A multilevel logistic regression model was used to create the final model of factors associated with AFM(1) contamination in milk. Feeds with fungal contamination (as determined by the BY test), high levels of cracked particles of commercial concentrate pellets, sunlight in the feed storage room, storage of commercial concentrates on the farm for more than 1 month, and more than 5% difference in relative humidity between the feed storage room and the barn holding lactating cows were associated with AFM(1) contamination in milk. The BY test was useful for screening cattle feed for fungal contamination, and the results of this test in conjunction with other factors can be used to monitor and prevent AFM(1) contamination in milk on small holder dairy farms.

TI  - Enhancing innovation in livestock value chains through networks: Lessons from fodder innovation case studies in developing countries
T2  - SCIENCE AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB  - Fodder scarcity is a perennial problem for many smallholder farmers in developing countries. This paper discusses how fodder technologies and knowledge have been introduced and integrated in diverse livestock production systems in Ethiopia, Syria and Vietnam. A synthesis of lessons learnt shows that fodder innovation is triggered and diffused by actors interacting and learning in networks, and on farms. Fodder innovation, being only one element of livestock value chains, is sustainably enhanced when linked to other innovations and market-oriented activities that optimize productivity gains. Yet innovating smallholder farmers face systemic constraints to access markets, and need to organize in groups to exploit opportunities. The paper concludes that rather than treating innovation systems and value chain approaches to agricultural development as separate tools, the integration of their complementary features enhances smallholders' innovation and market success.

TI  - Factors affecting the choice of governance structure along the vegetable value chain in Bangladesh
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Analyzing governance structure is considered important when designing development interventions in the value chain. The objective of this paper was to explore the governance structure (GS) in cauliflower and tomato value chain, specifically the types of GS followed by the farmers and factors behind these choices. The two-stage random sampling procedure was used to collect data from 100 farmers whereas 60 traders were surveyed purposively for this study. Multinomial logit model was used to analyze the factors affecting farmer's choice of GS. Trader's perceptions regarding internal and external governance as well as good governance indicators were assessed by utilizing non-parametric test. Cauliflower and tomato farmers were involved in practicing spot market, relational, farmer's association and outgrowing scheme-based GS. The results showed that the probability to choose relational, outgrowing scheme and farmer's association-based GS were significantly affected by education of farmers, distance to the nearest market, access to extension services, access to price information, trust commitment, transaction specific investment, preferences of diversification, farm size, transactional uncertainty, and access to producer's cooperative. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-U test established trader's dissimilation towards governance indicators. The study suggests that smallholder farmers need to be well organized and coordination mechanisms among all stakeholders should be increased.

TI  - Correlates and consequences of women's participation in the cowpea value chain in eastern Zambia
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - This paper analyses the link between gender differences and different activities along the cowpea value chain as well as food security and asset-based poverty using a recent cross-sectional data set of over 120 farm households in Eastern Zambia. We used the endogenous switching probit regression model to account for both observed and unobserved heterogeneity. Results show that women's participation in the cowpea value chain significantly increases cowpea production, marketing and adoption of improved cowpea varieties. It also reduces both food insecurity and poverty. However, women's participation in the value chain is limited by low levels of education, access to extension, credit, village markets, and improved agricultural technologies. Policies to address these constraints that limit women's participation in the cowpea value chain have the potential to reduce gender disparities, food insecurity, and poverty.

TI  - Uncertainty in milk production by smallholders in Tanzania and its implications for investment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - The study evaluates the impact of risk on enterprises of male, female and young farmers operating in the formal and informal smallholder dairy value chains in Tanzania. It also examines the effect of uncertainty on the decision to invest in milk production in the two value chains. Results indicate that youths in the informal dairy value chain face the greatest level of risk followed by men in the formal value chain, and then men in the informal value chain. Women in both value chains and youths in the formal value chain face relatively low risk. Overall, milk production in the informal value chain is found to be substantially riskier than production in the formal chain. Optimal investment triggers are found to be much larger than the conventional triggers and are sensitive to volatility of returns. The results' managerial and policy implications for inclusive dairy industry development in Tanzania are highlighted.

TI  - Power Relations and Upgrading in the Cashew Value Chain of Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
AB  - Development organizations are increasingly adopting market-based approaches to reducing rural poverty and food insecurity in the global South. The value chain approach is particularly popular. Aid donors, governments and non-governmental organizations are applying value chain concepts originally designed for promoting industrial production to smallholder agricultural production. Cashew development in Cote d'Ivoire illustrates this new approach to rural development in which upgrading' the production and processing links are top priorities. A core assumption informing this approach is that improvements in product quality at the producer level will yield higher producer prices and incomes. This article examines this assumed quality-price relationship through a comparative analysis of cashew quality and prices in Cote d'Ivoire. The research reveals a disconnect between nut quality and producer prices. The case study demonstrates that power relations are more important than quality in setting producer prices for raw cashew nuts.

TI  - Asset building in response to value chain development: lessons from taro producers in Nicaragua
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Value chain development (VCD) dominates discussions on how to address poverty through engagement with the private sector. In the rural sector, interventions often focus on building mutually beneficial linkages for production, and marketing of agricultural and forest products. However, the poverty impacts of VCD remain an open question. This research examines the impacts of interventions in Nicaragua for the development of a taro value chain involving smallholders, a cooperative and exporters. Poverty impacts are assessed at the household level based on changes in the endowments of five livelihood assets. Data collection concerned changes in asset endowments for 127 households from 2007 to 2009. The results suggest that the poverty impacts of VCD varied considerably based on production technologies, but that, in general were limited due to households low levels of pre-existing asset endowments, the limited nature of the VCD interventions and a less-than-enabling market and institutional context. Greater attention to the heterogeneous needs of the rural poor is necessary. Policy makers must also assume some responsibility for the external environment affecting private sector and NGO interventions to address poverty reduction goals through VCD.

TI  - How standards compete: comparative impact of coffee certification schemes in Northern Nicaragua
T2  - SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose - Smallholder farmers are increasingly subject to different types of standards that offer specific conditions for their market incorporation. The proliferation of private and voluntary (civic) standards raises questions regarding their impact on farmers welfare and their role in the upgrading of value chains. This paper aims to address this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on extensive fieldwork and careful matching of 315 farmers in Northern Nicaragua who produce coffee under Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance and Cafe Practices labels or deliver to independent traders, the effects on income, production and investments are compared. Moreover, the implications of different contract conditions for risk behaviour, organizational force, loyalty and gender attitudes are assessed.
   Findings - The paper finds that Fair Trade provides better prices compared with independent producers, but private labels out-compete Fair Trade in terms of yield and quality performance. While Fair Trade can be helpful to support initial market incorporation, private labels offer more suitable incentives for quality upgrading.
   Research limitations/implications - Civic standards exhibit major effects on local institutions' and farmers' behaviour, while B2B standards are more effective for improving production and management practices. Dynamic improvement standards may bridge the gap between both. Practical implications - Fair Trade standards are useful to provide initial market access to small-holders, but private standards offer better prospects for subsequent quality upgrading.
   Originality/value - This is the first large-scale comparative impact assessment of coffee standards that delivers unbiased empirical results.

TI  - Analysis of banana value chain in Ethiopia: Approaches to sustainable value chain development
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - Banana is an important commercial fruit crop for smallholder farmers in Arba Minch, southern Ethiopia. However, its sector is experiencing many constraints and limited attention given to productivity and marketing. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the banana value chain in order to identify constraints on productivity and marketing, and possibilities of improvements towards a sustainable value chain in Arba Minch. Data were collected through a survey, key informants' interviews, and focus group discussions. Different analytical and statistical tools were used for data analysis. Results describe actors, supporters, and influencers of the existing banana chain. The current banana chain has three different distribution channels in Arba Minch. The channel that connects with rural consumers has the highest value share for farmers while the channel that includes traveling traders has the lowest value share for farmers. The marketing cooperative channel has an intermediate value share for farmers in the chain. Poor agronomic practice, diseases, pests, and climate change were the major constraints for the banana yield while limited market information, lack of cold store and refrigerated trucks, poor post-harvest handling, lack of alternative markets, and weak capacity of cooperatives were the main constraints for banana marketing in Arba Minch. Economic, social and environmental indicators have a moderate sustainability performance within the Ethiopian context. The chain has an advantage in terms of profitability, employment, emission of air pollutants and constraints in terms of coordination, value share, profit margin, market diversity, product and market information, transportation, waste management, and safety and hygiene.

TI  - The grower-trader relationship: experiments with coffee value chain actors in Uganda
T2  - OXFORD DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - In this study, we explore the nature of the relationship between smallholder growers and local traders in the coffee value chain in Eastern Uganda. Analysing the results of two lab-in-the-field experiments (trust and dictator games), we highlight the complex relationship between these two value chain actors. We develop three competing hypotheses: (1) coffee growers will send more to fellow growers than local traders due to social identity and fairness motives as well as because of past opportunistic behaviour of traders (2) coffee growers will send more to traders to curry favour, and (3) growers will send growers and traders the same amount because in a relatively competitive market setting there is little room for opportunistic trader behaviour. We fail to reject our third hypothesis. Our results highlight the importance of fully understanding value chain actor relationships and contexts to better design interventions to improve rural markets.

TI  - A value chain analysis of Malaysia's seaweed industry
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY
AB  - A global shortfall in protein supply from capture fisheries has motivated the Malaysian government to revise its aquaculture strategy, focusing on three commodities: seaweed, fish and marine shrimp. However, the performance of the Malaysian aquaculture sector, particularly seaweed production, is poorly documented. This is the first empirical study to undertake a value chain analysis (VCA) of the Malaysian seaweed sector using stakeholder perceptions and secondary data that encompass members of seaweed farming cooperatives (the Semporna Area Farmers' Association and the governments' flagship Seaweed Cluster Project). Fieldwork was conducted between April and June 2015 among seaweed stakeholders involved in the value chain using a mixed methods approach-in-depth interviews with key informants, focus group discussions, household surveys, personal observation and secondary data. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from both upstream (seaweed farming, marketing structure and the Malaysian Good Aquaculture Practices [MyGAP] certification programme) and downstream (seaweed processing) activities involving farmers, intermediaries/middlemen (buyers), processors and officials. Kappaphycus spp. was sold in two forms: (1) dried seaweed to be used as raw materials in carrageenan processing (approximately 90% of total harvest) and (2) fresh seaweed to be used as a source of seedlings (approximately 10% of total harvest). The value chain ended with the carrageenan form, which is exported to international markets. The price of dried seaweed varied according to a combination of seaweed quality, the strength of farmer's relationships with intermediaries and processors and in response to demand from the carrageenan industry. The prices obtained by Malaysian farmers for dried seaweed and carrageenan remained low, US$ 0.60 and US$ 4.43 per kg, respectively, despite efforts by the government to enhance the value chain by imposing seaweed standards (via MyGAP) for farm management, dried seaweed and semi-refined carrageenan. The VCA was a useful tool to identify and map the market, with the results providing a better understanding of the seaweed sector, which could be helpful in supporting further aquaculture development in Malaysia.

TI  - Determinants of postharvest losses along smallholder producers maize and Sweetpotato value chains: an ordered Probit analysis
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Postharvest loss reduction throughout commodity value chains is an important pathway to food and nutrition security in sub-Saharan Africa. However, lack of understanding of the location and share of the losses and associated factors along the postharvest value chains remains a major challenge to operationalizing postharvest loss mitigation strategies. This paper assesses the determinants of postharvest losses at each postharvest stage of maize and sweetpotato (white fleshed and orange fleshed) value chains for smallholder farmers using our cross-sectional field survey data from two districts in Uganda. An ordered probit model estimation reveals that self-reported perceptions of the level of quantitative postharvest losses at different stages of commodity value chains are influenced by socio-economic factors as well as existing postharvest handling and storage practices. Increased years of education and training received on postharvest management are related to lower perceived levels of postharvest losses at key stages of value chains. Lower perceived postharvest losses are also associated with: at transport to homestead the use of sacks and bicycles as opposed to the use of baskets or transporting by trucks; at drying the use of tarpaulins as opposed to use of plastic sheets; shelling using bare-hands as opposed to beating cobs in sack with sticks; storage in a brick and mortar store as opposed to storing in living room in the house.

TI  - Value chains, partnerships and development: Using case studies to refine programme theories
T2  - EVALUATION
AB  - Partnerships between companies and non-governmental organizations that aim to incorporate smallholder farmers into value chains are increasingly being promoted as a way of pursuing development goals. This article investigates two case studies of such partnerships and the outcomes they achieved in order to refine the rationale underlying such interventions. In two case studies in Uganda and Rwanda, we documented the sequences of events within such partnership interventions, their context, and the intermediate outcomes, identified as the new rules and practices that generate institutional change. By portraying both the configuration of events within a partnership intervention and the contextual factors, these case studies reveal how the interventions produced outcomes that were situated in changing contexts, such as changes in market demand, government policy or business strategy. The research approach made it possible to disentangle partnership interventions and contextual processes, and to give participants a firmer idea of the potential and limitations of value chain partnerships to achieve developmental targets.

TI  - A Value Chain Approach to Forest Landscape Restoration: Insights from Vietnam's Production-Driven Forest Restoration
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
AB  - According to FAO figures, over 129 million hectares of forests have been lost globally since the 1990s, mainly in the tropical Global South, where agriculture acts as the main driver of forest conversion. International commitments, such as the Bonn Challenge, aim to reverse this trend through the application of forest landscape restoration (FLR) as an integrated and inclusive restoration approach. Beyond the discourse level, however, FLR implementation lags behind expectations due to insufficient funding and a disconnection with local implementation. We argue that, instead of relying on public resources for conservation driven restoration, increased private sector engagement may point the way out of the funding impasse. However, this requires a shift towards production-driven FLR, which includes the livelihood needs of communities and smallholders as agents of landscape transition. For achieving the dual purpose of connecting landscapes with markets and promoting sustainable landscape restoration, we ascribe value chains and their economic, social and ecological configurations a key role in production-driven FLR. Drawing on Vietnam's forest restoration pathway as an illustrative case, we examine how production-driven forest restoration, smallholder engagement and value chain upgrading can stimulate positive landscape transitions. We conclude that, depending on their configuration, value chains can have negative or positive social and ecological impacts at the landscape level. Furthermore, regulated, progressive and high-value commodity chains may perform better in the areas of integrated FLR objectives landscape integrity, ecological functionality and human well-being.

TI  - Private Business-Driven Value Chains and Nutrition: Insights from India
T2  - IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - Despite rapid economic growth, undernutrition rates in South Asia remain among the highest in the world. It is also seen that both rural and urban populations in developing countries are increasingly dependent on markets for food. This makes examining the potential of different agri-food models to deliver nutritious foods relevant. This article examines the value chains of two fortified foods manufactured by private sector business in India using the conceptual framework in Maestre, Poole and Henson (2017), to understand their potential to reach economically poor households. We find that both value chains have potential but are unsuccessful in reaching nutritionally vulnerable populations. In both cases, a favourable institutional environment can enable them to have a pro-nutrition and pro-poor focus. A proactive state role and regulation are called for to provide the necessary institutional environment to ensure that private business-led value chains focus on enhanced intake of nutritious food by low-income households.

TI  - Income inequality and distribution patterns in the cassava value chain in the Oyo State, Nigeria: a gender perspective
T2  - BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose This study analyses income inequality and distribution patterns among key actors in the cassava value chain. The study also identifies factors that influence profit of key actors in the cassava value chain. Design/methodology/approach The study was conducted in Oyo State, Nigeria, using primary data from 620 actors, consisting of 400 farmers, 120 processors and 100 traders in the cassava value chain. The Gini coefficient was used to estimate income inequalities within and between actors. Multiple linear regression was applied to identify factors that influence the profit of the actors in the cassava value chain. Findings The result shows a gender pattern in the participation in the cassava value chain: men dominate in the production, whereas women mostly engage in processing and marketing of processed cassava products. We also find that incomes are unequally distributed among actors, favouring traders and processors more than farmers in the value chain. Women are better off in processing and trading of value-added products than in the raw cassava production. Spatial differences also contribute to income inequality among farmers in the cassava value chain. An increase in farmers and processors' incomes reduces inequality in the value chain while an increase in traders' income widens inequality. Age is significantly negatively correlated with actors' profit at 1%, while educational level significantly increases their profit at 5%. Processors and traders with large households have a higher profit. We also find that farm size, experience and labour input have significant positive effects on farmers' profit only at 5%. Membership in an association increases farmers and processors' profit at 1 and 10%, respectively. Practical implications The study recommends that agricultural policies that promote agrifood value chains should aim at minimizing income inequality by targeting vulnerable groups, particularly female farmers to achieve sustainable development in rural communities. Originality/value Existing studies recognise income inequality in agricultural value chains in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there are few rigorous quantitative studies that address this pressing issue. Our paper fills this knowledge gap and suggests ways to minimise income inequality in the agri-food value chain, using the example of the cassava value chain in Nigeria.

TI  - Producer organizations and contract farming: a comparative study of smallholders' market strategies in South India
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGRAPHIE
AB  - The fundamental restructuring processes of agri-food networks in developing and emerging markets have intensified the debate on how to improve the integration of smallholders into so called modern value chains. In this context, the company-driven contract farming model and the member-based model of producer organizations are discussed by practitioners and in the scholarly literature as alternatives to traditional market systems. This study compares the models' abilities to address economic challenges of highly fragmented and small-scale dominated agriculture on a household as well as on an aggregate level. It analyzes empirical data from the Indian floriculture sector with the global value chain approach. The study reveals that the smallholders perceive both contract farming and producer organization to be beneficial for their households' economic risk situation, while only the producer organization has a positive effect on the households' income. The contract farming benefits production and value chain efficiency, whereas the producer organization does not show an impact in these respects. We thus observe that the contract farming model increases value creation in the overall chain, but it does not raise the producer's value capture; while the producer organization model does not heighten value creation in the overall chain, but it lifts the producers' value capture. The organization's individual capabilities determine how each model addresses the economic challenges. Overall, the author argues that contract farming and producer organizations are supplementing, not competitive, strategies and should be applied in combination.

TI  - The contribution of frankincense to the agro-pastoral household economy and its potential for commercialization - A case from Borana, southern Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - Frankincense, gum arabic and myrrh are among the most valuable commercial non-timber forest products in the drylands of eastern Africa. This study examines the frankincense value chain and its contribution to the household economy in southern Ethiopia. The study applied a combination of sustainable livelihood and value chain framework to assess the values and the contribution of frankincense to household economies. Data were collected through a household survey, focus group discussions, key informant interviews and field observations. On average, the annual cash income generated from the harvest and sale of frankincense was estimated at 60 USD per adult equivalent unit (AEU) which was 35% of the total household annual cash income. Our analyses reveal that income from frankincense constitutes the second largest share of the total average household cash income after livestock, which accounted for 60%. The poorer households (44% of the sample) have a relatively higher reliance on frankincense income (49.8%), which is almost as much as the contribution from livestock and non-farm income combined (50.2%). Frankincense income functions as a supplementary source of income for the herders. The value chain analysis shows that the price increases from nearly 1 USD per kg at harvest sites to 5.5 USD per kg at the retail level. Nevertheless, despite the abundance of the resource and a growing domestic market demand, the marketed quantities are low, extraction practices are primitive and both local and national markets are poorly developed. Recommendations for researchers and development practitioners include improving harvesting and processing skills through training, introducing harvesting and post-harvest technologies, improving market access, providing credit services, and training to gatherers and local traders on value adding activities and marketing skills. These measures could improve the economic returns from frankincense extraction and sale and contribute to increased incomes and more sustainable livelihoods.

TI  - 'Plant, Sleep, Pick': Ambivalent Smallholder Market Engagement and Inclusive Value Chains in Northwest Nepal
T2  - DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
AB  - Inclusive value chain frameworks have been widely adopted by states and international development agencies as a strategy for addressing rural poverty. The approach aims to improve smallholder farmers' linkages to agricultural markets and to increase the value of their products within these markets. Inclusive value chain initiatives targeting apple producers in northwestern Nepal are illustrative of this development approach. This article examines apple production in Jumla District, which has expanded rapidly over the last two decades, and shows how value chain development interventions have sought to accelerate a shift towards commercial agriculture by linking producers to agribusiness partners and upgrading production. A central assumption of these interventions is that farmers will aim to maximize profits through entrepreneurial strategies within targeted value chains. However, as this article demonstrates, a closer investigation of the political ecology of apple production in the region calls this assumption into question. The article argues that the popularity of apples in Jumla District must be situated within processes of agrarian change and livelihood diversification that have informed labour-saving, risk-averse approaches to apple market participation. The findings lend support to calls for strategies that prioritize autonomy and long-term risk mitigation over competitive market integration.

TI  - The contribution of small-scale, privately owned tropical aquaculture to food security and dietary diversity in Bolivia
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - New aquaculture systems are emerging in new contexts around the world in part due to aquaculture's perceived development benefits. However, linkages between aquaculture and food security in these systems are unclear. This study investigated the impact of emerging small-scale, business-oriented fish culture in central Bolivia on the food security and dietary diversity of aquaculture producers (n = 40) and workers (n = 26) in the value chain and compared them to local non-aquaculture farmers (n = 40). Three pathways were investigated: fish consumption, household income, and women's participation. Food insecurity was widespread and did not vary in a statistically significant way between groups, but a trend toward greater food security amongst aquaculture producers was observed. Dietary diversity was highly homogenous, with the notable exception of high fish consumption amongst producers. Aquaculture was related to higher income, and income has a modest positive effect on food security for aquaculturists and non-aquaculture farmers, but not aquaculture value chain workers. Income did not have an effect on dietary diversity. Women's involvement in aquaculture was correlated positively to productivity, profitability, and size of operation, while male-only aquaculture was negatively correlated to these. The value chain generated employment, especially for women, but average wages were higher for men. The research provides important insight into aquaculture-food security linkages by showing that the introduction of small-scale business-oriented aquaculture systems can provide nutritious products for regional consumption and can have positive effects on food security but is not sufficient to change local dietary preferences more broadly.

TI  - CATASTROPHIC DROUGHT INSURANCE BASED ON THE REMOTELY SENSED NORMALISED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX FOR SMALLHOLDER FARMERS IN ZIMBABWE
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - Index insurance, which indemnifies agricultural producers based on an objectively observable variable that is highly correlated with production losses but which cannot be influenced by the producer, can provide adequate protection against catastrophic droughts without suffering from the moral hazard and adverse selection problems that typically cause conventional agricultural insurance programmes to fail. Using historical maize and cotton yield data from nine districts in Zimbabwe, we find that catastrophic drought insurance contracts based on the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be constructed whose indemnities exhibit higher correlations with yield losses than the conventional rainfall index. In addition the NDVI contracts can be offered within the 5 to 10 per cent premium range considered reasonably affordable to many poor smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe.

TI  - A Comparative Value Chain Analysis of Smallholder Burley Tobacco Production in Malawi-2003/4 and 2009/10
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE
AB  - Smallholders grow the majority of Malawi's main export crop - burley tobacco. We analyse this value chain segment for the 2003/4 and 2009/10 seasons. The comparison shows smallholder profits in 2003/4 were limited by two main factors: a cartel of leaf merchants at auction and inefficient marketing arrangements. In 2009/10, there was greater competition at auction, improvements in marketing, tighter state regulation (including minimum prices) and much more contract farming. The paper concludes by reflecting on aspects of the political economy of the tobacco industry at national and global levels.

TI  - Procedural Justice in Value Chains Through Public-private Partnerships
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This paper is about making agricultural value chains work for smallholder farmers, and the way that governments can achieve this aim through public-private partnerships (PPPs). Applied to agricultural value chains, PPP5 seek to catalyze new investments, support chain upgrading, or improve the performance of poorly functioning chains through joint activities that capitalize on the complementary resources and competencies of public and private partners. Smallholder farmers are frequently the intended beneficiaries. However, there is little understanding of how the terms of value chain participation affect farmer perceptions of and behavior within chains, or the role of the public sector in influencing these arrangements. This paper analyzes in-depth case studies from Ghana, Indonesia, Rwanda, and Uganda to better understand a surprising empirical finding: that farmers that experience strong PPP results in terms of productivity and incomes may nevertheless remain dissatisfied, while those experiencing much more modest gains can view the PPP favorably. At the heart is an analytical framework based on five attributes of "procedural justice". It finds that public sector actors, through PPP5, are able to shape governance within value chains, influencing the relative skills, knowledge, and resources which different actors possess, the way that farmers are organized to engage in the value chain, and the attributes of procedural justice reflected in chain arrangements. Where procedural justice is weak, farmers are more likely to exit or neglect the arrangements, leaving the value chain underperforming with sub-optimal outcomes for all: for farmers, for lead firms, and for government agencies. Government involvement in value chains should be premised on facilitating relationships that are more procedurally just than those which would be expected to arise through the market alone.

TI  - Does Participation in Agricultural Value Chain Activities Influence Smallholder Fruit Grower Production Performance? A Cross-Sectional Study of Apple Farmers in Shandong, China
T2  - HORTICULTURAE
AB  - The value chain comprises several factors and activities useful for strengthening production and distribution by connecting producers with suppliers, intermediaries, and marketplaces and collaboratively creating added value for products or goods. However, the values of agricultural products mostly depend on various factors and actors, which should be linked together for fostering added values. Thus, there may be strong ground for facilitating a smooth transition of the agricultural value chain (AVC) within the prospects of emerging countries. It could be a key means of promoting a profound connection between smallholder farmers and modern agriculture facilities. It could be especially crucial for the highly perishable and high-value product such as fruits. The main aims of the study are to evaluate the factors influencing smallholder apple farmers' participation in the agricultural value chain and determine whether participation in AVC improves farmers' production performance. The empirical setup of the study was chosen based on survey data of apple growers in Shandong, China. The propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) models were employed to craft the study's outcomes. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) Fruit farmers' gender, total household expenditure, housing value, planting scale, planting years, degree of specialization, days of family labour input, and total days of employment have significant effects on their participation in AVC activities. (2) Fruit farmers' usage of improved fertilizers and organization participation supports a higher yield and net income per acre. (3) Participating in two kinds of AVC can significantly improve the yield per acre and net income per acre compared with only using one type of AVC (improved fertilizer). Policy makers should improve the existing policy by eliminating institutional barriers and enhancing human factors for farmers to participate in high-value chain activities. Governments should extend technical support, and enhance training facilities, and comprehensively promote the AVC among smallholder farmers. Finally, farmers' organizations (e.g., cooperatives and credit organizations) should come forward to help facilitate the effectiveness of AVC.

TI  - The Welfare Effects of Trade in Phytomedicines: A Multi-Disciplinary Analysis of Turmeric Production
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - International trade in medicinal herbal products is growing, while value chains are becoming more complex and governed by a range of public and private standards. There is a debate over the extent to which phytomedicine production can be beneficial for farmers in low- and middle-income countries. More generally, there are varied views about the extent to which small farmers are disadvantaged by stringent public health and private consumer standards in northern markets for agricultural products. This paper proves a comparative analysis of value chains, using case studies of turmeric production in India. It marries a qualitative investigation of turmeric producing sites in India with an investigation into the chemical quality of various turmeric products. The aim of the paper is to understand the way that varied structure and governance of value chains changes the benefits to both producer and consumer. When production is for the organic northern market, we found evidence of a "captive" value chain, where the lead firm requires strict adherence to conditions of production and processing. Prices for farmers were relatively stable, at a reasonably high level. In contrast, where farmers were producing for local markets, including the major auction at Erode, prices were volatile and farmers bore considerable risk. We found that competition and volatility in the market-based chain can lead to turmeric adulteration and contamination, both intentional and unintentional. Our case study suggests that many small turmeric farmers would find it difficult to meet both public and private health standards, in contrast to some academic literature that argues that public health standards do not discriminate against small farmers. More than this, our study adds to the discussion of the impact of standards, suggesting clear consumer benefits in northern markets. However, there are also indications that only larger and more dynamic farmers can participate in the lucrative phytomedicine trade. As such, our study tentatively supports previous literature suggesting that the application of standards in northern markets lead to increasing farmer differentiation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Strategic Approach to Value Chain Upgrading-Adopting Innovations and Their Impacts on Farm Households in Tanzania
T2  - HORTICULTURAE
AB  - The level of agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa remains far below the global average. This is partly due to the scarce use of production- and process-enhancing technologies. This study aims to explore the driving forces and effects of adopting innovative agricultural technologies in food value chains (FVC). These enhancing FVC technologies are referred to as upgrading strategies (UPS) and are designed to improve specific aspects of crop production, postharvest processing, market interaction, and consumption. Based on cross-sectional data collected from 820 Tanzanian farm households, this study utilized the adaptive lasso to analyse the determinants of UPS. To measure the impact of their adoption on well-being, this study applied the propensity score matching approach (PSM). Results from the adaptive lasso suggested that access to credit, experience of environmental shocks and social capital were the main drivers of UPS adoption. In contrast, the engagement in off-farm wage employment impeded adoption. The results from the PSM suggested that UPS adoption has a positive and significant impact on well-being among sampled households, especially with respect to their total value of durable goods and commercialization. The paper suggests that the promotion of social capital and access to financial capital is pivotal in enhancing the adoption of innovative UPS in the farming sector.

TI  - Caprine milk as a source of income for women instead of a taboo: a comparative analysis of the implication of women in the caprine and bovine value chains in Fatick, Senegal
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD ECONOMICS
AB  - Domestic animals, especially small ruminants, are an important source of income for millions of smallholder farmers, particularly women, in Senegal. The aim of this study was to understand the place of the bovine and caprine milk value chains and to identify the role and challenges for women in the Fatick livestock production sector. A survey was conducted among a sample of 50 female producers, including 30 and 20 from the bovine and caprine milk value chains, respectively. Descriptive statistics were performed to compare the caprine and bovine milk value chains in terms of activities, products, and implications for household incomes while showing the place of women at different links of these value chains. The result of the study showed that the bovine milk value chain provided higher income compared to the caprine's, but the latter was found to be more diverse in terms of milk-derived products with increased income opportunities' potential. Remoteness, lack of equipment, and cultural biases were reported to be the main constraints in the caprine value chain, while milk price fluctuations were reported to be the biggest challenge for producers in the bovine milk value chain. Access to land and government subsidy programs and domestic time management were the main and specific challenges affecting women in the bovine and caprine value chains. Therefore, there is a need for the establishment of policies and interventions that consider the needs, opportunities, and complementarity offered by both the caprine and bovine milk value chains across smallholder women settings, while putting gender mainstreaming at the center of the discussions and reforms.

AB  - This article evaluates a hybrid seed contract between Indonesian smallholders and Pioneer Hybrid International. A transaction cost approach was used to analyse contract participation, total farm gross margins and labour and chemical use. The empirical results suggest: (a) the contract favours farmers with more irrigated land; (b) the contract improved returns to farm capital and was welfare improving; (c) the contract increased the demand for non-family labour, particularly female labour; and (d) the contract increased the intensity of chemical use. The success of the contract was attributed to the nature of the contracting process, which was between Pioneer and grower groups and not individual small-holders.

TI  - Digital platforms for smallholder credit access: The mediation of trust for cooperation in maize value chain financing
T2  - NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Maize production is of critical importance to smallholder farmers in Ghana. Various factors limit the productivity of smallholder maize farming systems undergirded by the lack of capital for critical investments both at the farm and at national policy levels. Using a value chain approach, this diagnostic study explains how a complex configuration of actor interaction within an institutionally and agro-ecologically challenged value chain leads to the enduring absence of maize farming credit support. We find a cycle of credit rationing resulting from value chain challenges such as agro-ecological uncertainties, inadequate GAPs training, weak farmer groups and market insecurity. This condition is sustained by an interplay between mistrust, insufficient information across the value chain and inadequate control strategies in the maize credit system. We argue that Digital Platforms (DPs) show potential to help overcome some information and communication gaps and related uncertainties that impede traditional value chain credit arrangements. This is promising in terms of aiding awareness and coordinated responsiveness to agro-ecological farm conditions and the development of farming records databases. Thus, DPs could generate new networks and forms of cooperation in the maize value chain in this regard. As a tool for mediating trust in value chain credit cooperation, strategic use of these DP contributions could help initiate an entry point for recalibration of trust perceptions. Significant considerations and improvements are however needed to harness DPs effectively in mediating trust for maize credit provision, not least being farmer digital inclusion in DP implementation, effective intermediation and network governance arrangements and digital contributions towards cost-effective agro-ecological controls in the erratic maize farming context. This approach to trust building should therefore not be viewed as a quick fix but as a process of trial and error, and learning by doing.

AB  - Value chain development (VCD) has emerged as one pro-poor market-oriented strategy targeting smallholder farmers. Emphasis has been placed on women smallholders, but few studies examine intra-household dynamics related to VCD opportunities. Through a case study on native potato value chains in the central highlands of Peru, this study draws on semi-structured interviews to explore intra-household decisions to participate in VCD, how household agricultural labour is organised, and barriers to women's involvement. Despite efforts encouraging women to participate, men dominated all aspects of the initiative. Thus, proactive efforts by development organisations need to address resource discrepancies and entrenched gender norms.

TI  - Value chain development of bay leaf in Nepal: an impact assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS
AB  - We assessed an impact of bay leaf value chain intervention programme on household welfare in mountain agroforestry context. We used primary survey data from project and comparison villages and propensity score matching for creating a valid counterfactual. Results indicate that households in the project villages planted 75 per cent more bay leaf trees, produced 170 per cent more bay leaves and sold more quality products at higher prices than households in comparison villages; per-capita household income increased by NPR 5000-7300, share of bay leaf income in total household income increased by 8-10 per cent and level of poverty declined by 6-8 per cent. Households with female respondents benefited more in some aspects but not so in others, especially in enrolling children in school.

TI  - Perspectives on Reducing the National Milk Deficit and Accelerating the Transition to a Sustainable Dairy Value Chain in Zimbabwe
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - The Zimbabwean dairy industry is massively underperforming, as evidenced by a reduction in milk yield from 262 million liters in 1990 to <37 million liters in 2009 and a steady but slow increase to 82 million liters in 2021. The current demand for milk in Zimbabwe stands at 130 million liters, and there is a national capacity for processing 400 million liters per annum. This study used literature, stakeholder inputs and expert knowledge to provide a perspective on practical options to reduce the national milk deficit and, simultaneously, accelerate the transition to a sustainable dairy value chain in Zimbabwe. Following a discussion on the key barriers and constraints to developing the milk value chain, we explored opportunities to improve the performance of the underperforming smallholder and medium-scale dairy farmers. Specifically, we discussed innovative management, creative policy instruments and alternative technological options to maximize milk production in Zimbabwe. We also highlight the need for an inclusive and creatively organized dairy value chain to optimize stakeholder linkages and improve information flow and equity. Examples of crucial investments and incentive structures for upgrading the existing value chain and monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and carbon uptake are discussed. Furthermore, the socio-economic effects (i.e., profitability, women empowerment and employment creation), milk quality, safety and traceability issues linked to a better organized and performing dairy value chain are highlighted.

TI  - Ambition meets reality: lessons from the taro boom in Nicaragua
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose Between 2006 and 2011, Nicaragua shipped an average of US$9.4 million per year of smallholder-produced fresh taro (Colocasia esculenta) to the USA; however, by 2016, the US market for Nicaraguan taro had effectively collapsed. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the short-lived taro boom from the perspective of complex adaptive systems, showing how shocks, interactions between value chain actors, and lack of adaptive capacity among chain actors together contributed to the collapse of the chain.
   Design/methodology/approach Primary data were collected from businesses and smallholders in 2010 and 2016 to understand the actors involved, their business relations, and the benefits and setbacks they experienced along the way.
   Findings The results show the capacity of better-off smallholders to engage in a demanding market, but also the struggles faced by more vulnerable smallholders to build new production systems and respond to internal and external shocks. Local businesses were generally unprepared for the uncertainties inherent in fresh horticultural trade or for engagement with distant buyers.
   Research limitations/implications Existing guides and tools for designing value chain interventions will benefit from greater attention to the circumstances of local actors and the challenges of building productive inter-business relations under higher levels of risk and uncertainty.
   Originality/value This case serves as a wake-up call for practitioners, donors, researchers, and the private sector on how to identify market opportunities and the design of more robust strategies to respond to them.

TI  - Linkages between tourism and agriculture for inclusive development in Tanzania A value chain perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM INSIGHTS
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how local agricultural communities are integrated into the tourism value chains and provide insights into how this can contribute to poverty reduction.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study employed the value chain approach to gain an understanding of the linkages between tourism and agriculture. Interviews involving local suppliers of agricultural products and tourism businesses (n = 195) were conducted in Lushoto, Tanzania. The livelihood portfolios (range of activities - farming, employment, tourism, etc.) were analyzed in terms of the resources (economic, natural, human, physical and social assets) available to individuals and households and how these are optimally used to achieve inclusive growth.
   Findings - The findings show that the form of tourism business ownership and the presence of specific social networks between tourism businesses and local suppliers dictate the mode of buying and the strength of supply chains. Community-based tourism is dominant in the area, allowing tourists to interact with agrarian rural communities. However, the optimal local linkages have been hampered by the quantitative and qualitative mismatch between locally supplied products and the tourism sector's requirements. The failure of many initiatives aimed at addressing the mismatch creates a need for empowering local communities to enable them to take the opportunities that tourism provides.
   Practical implications - Least developed countries need to build on the lessons learned from the development of tourism in their local settings, and pursue strategies which bring hope, confidence and real benefits to the majority of the struggling population. This study gives an insight on how inter-sectoral linkages could be embraced among the strategies or means of reducing rampant poverty.
   Originality/value -Linking local agricultural production to tourism has long been seen as a promising way to make tourism more economically inclusive. However, the use of value chain approach in studying the tourism-agriculture linkages for inclusive development, especially in the developing economies is not common. While employing Porter's value chains analysis, this study provides insights into how local farmers can be incorporated in tourism food supply chains in an ethical and beneficial way.

TI  - Additionality and Implementation Gaps in Voluntary Sustainability Standards
T2  - NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB  - Voluntary Sustainability Standards have become a popular private governance framework for more sustainable agri-food value chains. However, recent mainstreaming efforts have increased competition between standards and driven down price premiums. This study employs a dataset of 659 Honduran coffee producers to examine whether the most widely used standards in the coffee sector (4C, Fairtrade, Fairtrade/organic, UTZ Certified and Rainforest Alliance) represent effective solutions for improving the social, environmental and economic sustainability practices of smallholder farmers under such conditions. It presents 54 farm-level indicators, compared across five standard systems, and links field results to a discussion of the strategies and governance prospects of voluntary standards. We find that no scheme has managed to grow substantially while maintaining strong additionality: commercially successful standards show little impact, while stricter schemes create high entry barriers and unresolved opportunity costs. Successful mainstreaming would require better cost coverage of sustainability improvements by value chain actors .

TI  - Partnerships Blending Institutional Logics for Inclusive Global and Regional Food Value Chains in Ghana; with What Smallholder Effect?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - We witness a promotion of hybrid partnerships, where actors with different competences and resources collaborate for smallholder inclusive value chain development. To better understand the functioning of these partnerships, we used institutional theory and studied the context of a global and emerging regional food value chains in Ghana, the blending of logics by key actors in Innovation Platforms and Public Private Partnerships, and their effect on value chain relations of smallholder farmers. In the global value chain of cocoa, partnerships adhered to 'green revolution' and 'free-market' logics, and provided all farmers material support. In the more informally organised regional food sector, local executing partners selectively coupled their logics with those of poor smallholders, who rely on low-input agriculture and solidarity logics to make ends meet. This improved the position and transaction costs of smallholders to participate in the value chain. Hence, it is more likely for partnerships to create smallholder inclusive governance in informally organised regional food value chains, than highly structured global value chains controlled by international buyers. To gain insight in the variety of political effects this triggers in different social-historical shaped farmer communities, households and actors, we recommend complementary local research from a critical institutional perspective.

TI  - Making Smallholder Value Chain Partnerships Inclusive: Exploring Digital Farm Monitoring through Farmer Friendly Smartphone Platforms
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Value chain partnerships face difficulties achieving inclusive relations, often leading to unsustainable collaboration. Improving information flow between actors has been argued to contribute positively to a sense of inclusion in such partnership arrangements. Smallholders however usually lack the capability to use advanced communication technologies such as smartphones which offer a means for elaborate forms of information exchange. This study explores to what extent co-designing smartphone platforms with smallholders for farm monitoring contributes to smallholder ability to communicate, and how this influences smallholder sense of inclusion. The study uses an Action Design Research approach in engaging smallholders in Ghana, through multi-stakeholder and focus group discussions, in a reflexive co-design process. The research finds that co-designing a platform interface was significant in improving farmer ability to comprehend and use smartphone based platforms for communicating farm conditions and their needs with value chain partners. Farmers were however skeptical of making demands based on the platform due to their lack of power and mistrust of other actors. This highlights a need for adjusting the social and political dimensions of partnership interactions, in tandem with the advancement of digital tools, in order to effectively facilitate a sense of inclusiveness in partnerships.

TI  - LEGU-MED: Developing Biodiversity-Based Agriculture with Legume Cropping Systems in the Mediterranean Basin
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Environmental degradation and the decrease of ecosystem service provision are currently of major concern, with current agricultural systems being a major driver. To meet our future environmental and sustainability targets a transformation of the agro-food systems and current agricultural value chain are crucial. One approach to redesign farming systems is the concept of biodiversity-based agriculture (BBA) which relies on sustainable diversification of biological components and their natural interactions in farming systems to maximize fertility, productivity, and resilience to external perturbations. Despite minimizing anthropogenic inputs, BBA is not yet able to meet all beneficial environmental objectives. BBA applied in the Mediterranean basin requires urgent innovation in approaches, methodologies, and models for small-holder traditional farming systems to ensure a stable provision of ecosystem services and better resilience to environmental stresses linked to climate change. Legumes are the backbone of the Mediterranean agro-ecosystems from ancient times, but their unique and wide biodiversity was not sufficiently valorized, especially by North-African countries. Here, we present LEGU-MED, a three-year international project funded by PRIMA initiative 2019. An international consortium was established involving five universities, 5 research institutes, and one private company from 8 countries: Italy, Germany, Spain, Algeria, Tunisia, Turkey, Lebanon, and Croatia. The main objective of this project is to put forward an international and well-integrated plan to valorize the legume agrobiodiversity of the Mediterranean in biodiversity-based farming systems and consequently enhance agro-ecosystem functions and services in the Mediterranean basin. The successful completion of LEGU-MED will have the following impacts on Mediterranean legume-based farming systems: (1) improve water use efficiency, (2) reduce the use of anthropogenic inputs through the maintenance of soil fertility, (3) enhance pollination and improve ecological connectivity with flora and fauna, (4) protect close-by wildland ecosystems, (5) enhance other ecosystem services (e.g., pest, disease, and weed suppression), and (6) provide healthier and safer protein-rich food.

TI  - An economic evaluation of SPREAD on Rwanda's rural population
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - Sustainable Partnerships to Enhance Rural Enterprises and Agricultural Development (SPREAD) was a programme to enhance the value chain for commodities in Rwanda including coffee. The implicit concept was that improving the value chain would increase the incomes for smallholders and, hence, reduce the poverty rate. The results indicate that Rwanda coffee prices increased relative to an index price for traded coffee with the implementation of SPREAD. In addition, the results indicate that participation in the coffee market at this time was associated with higher household income and lower rates of poverty.

TI  - The Fine Line between Trusting and Cheating: Exploring Relationships between Actors in Ugandan Pineapple Value Chains
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Inclusive food value chain development is particularly challenging when numerous smallholders engage in production and trade of non-standardised food products within spatially dispersed systems. Drawing on the concept of human activity systems with an emphasis on purposefulness, we provide a situated account of the activities and relations that shape the pineapple value chain in Uganda. Based on semi-structured interviews with farmers, brokers and traders, we examined the creation and maintenance of business relationships as well as challenges faced. Findings show how trust unfolds to mediate exchange relations that structure chain organisation. Reflecting the uncertain business environment and vulnerability of actors, trustful relationships are simultaneously threatened by opportunities for short-term gain, referred to as "cheating''. Embracing the importance of trust-based relational exchanges for sustaining local economic systems can provide critical leverage for development that puts smallholder farmers and other small-scale value chain actors at the centre.

TI  - An empirical evaluation of policy options for inclusive dairy value chain development in Nicaragua: A system dynamics approach
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Achieving inclusive value chain development is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of interconnected value chains and their social, economic, and ecological dimensions. While many policies and intervention options exist to upgrade value chains, there are fewer methods that can be used to understand and quantify the multidimensional impacts that value chain policies and interventions may have throughout the value chain. This paper addresses this methodological gap by employing a system dynamics (SD) modeling approach. SD models allow us to model and quantify the processes and relationships inherent in the value chain through simulations, serving as a policy laboratory for the empirical assessment of intervention options. An SD model of the Matiguas dairy value chain in Nicaragua was developed and tested through a participatory modeling process. Our research tested and evaluated the short-, medium-, and long-term impacts of specific interventions and policies in the Matiguas daily value chain with the goal of strengthening the competitiveness and inclusion of small- and medium-scale producers. These interventions centered on improving the feeding system, which was identified by stakeholders as the critical constraint to competitiveness. The policy analysis reveals that both improved pastures and increased use of concentrates raise producer milk productivity by 5% and 11%, respectively in the long run, but are also expensive strategies for smallholder producers, leading to a reduction in profits relative to the baseline by 1% and 3%, respectively. Consequently, policymakers should identify strategies that help to reduce concentrate costs and support producers with investments in improved pasture, while also promoting training in pasture management skills. Indeed, in the long-run, model results reveal that investment and training in pasture management results in a 30% and 35% increase in milk production during the wet and dry season, respectively. Simulation results further highlighted that intensifying the feeding system to improve cow milk yields is mainly profitable in the long term, and thus requires a longer-term perspective by policymakers. The model provides a deeper understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of the Matiguas dairy value chain and the interactions between markets, coordination aspects, biophysical phenomena, and income. The system dynamics approach to value chain analysis further addresses a major analytical shortcoming in value chain analysis and provides decision makers with an improved platform for planning and policy formulation.

TI  - Delivery of iron-fortified yoghurt, through a dairy value chain program, increases hemoglobin concentration among children 24 to 59 months old in Northern Senegal: A cluster-randomized control trial
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Innovative strategies are needed to enhance the nutritional impact of agriculture. Value chain approaches, which use supply chains to add value (usually economic) to products as they move from producers to consumers, can be used to increase access to nutritious foods and improve nutritional status. This study tested whether a dairy value chain could be used to distribute a micronutrient-fortified yoghurt (MNFY) (conditional upon the producer supplying a minimum amount of cow milk/day) to improve hemoglobin and reduce anemia among preschool children in a remote area in Northern Senegal.
   Methods
   A cluster randomized control trial was used to compare 204 children (24 to 59 months of age at baseline) from households who received the MNFY coupled to a behavior change communication (BCC) campaign focusing on anemia prevention to 245 children from a control group (receiving BCC only) after one year. Randomization was done at the level of the family concession (households from the same family) (n = 321). Eligible households had a child of the target age and were willing to deliver milk to the dairy factory. Changes in anemia and hemoglobin between groups were assessed using mixed regression models.
   Key findings
   Anemia prevalence was very high at baseline (80%) and dropped to close to 60% at endline, with no differences between intervention groups. Hemoglobin increased by 0.55 g/dL, 95% CI (0.27; 0.84) more in the intervention compared to the control group after one year, in models that controlled for potentially confounding factors. The impact was greater (0.72 g/dL, 95% CI (0.34; 1.12)) for boys, compared to girls (0.38 g/dL, 95% CI (-0.03; 0.80)).
   Conclusion
   The dairy value chain was a successful strategy to distribute MNFY among pastoralists in Northern Senegal, and increase Hb concentrations among their children. This study is one of the first proofs of concept showing that a nutrition-sensitive agriculture value chain approach can contribute to improved child nutrition in a remote pastoralist population.

TI  - Indicators and Determinants of Small-Scale Bamboo Commercialization in Ethiopia
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Bamboo is an abundant resource in Ethiopia and has a great potential for commercialization, which can drive rural development. In view of these realities, this study analyzed the state and determinants of small-scale bamboo commercialization in Ethiopia. Data were collected from three major bamboo-growing districts (Awi, Sidama, and Sheka) and four urban centers (Masha, Hawassa, Bahir Dar, and Addis Ababa) via semi-structured interviews, group discussions, and questionnaire surveys with key actors along the value chain. Results revealed distinctive differences in proportion of cash income, value chain structure, and management engagement among the districts. Percentages of cash income were 60.15, 42.60, and 9.48 at Awi, Sidam, and Sheka, respectively. Differences were statistically significant between Sheka and both other districts (p = 0.05), but not between Awi and Sidama. The value chain structure showed that compared with Sheka, Awi and Sidama have a relatively large number of actors involved. The major factors explaining commercialization differences among regions were distance to market and presence of alternative forest products. Within Sheka, households with larger family size, higher education attainment, and access to training reportedly engaged more in commercial extraction. Therefore, we conclude that development of infrastructure for linking resource and consumer centers and expansion of extension education among producers may enhance the commercial engagement of producers and improve the accessibility of bamboo resources for commercial production.

TI  - Ex-ante evaluation of interventions to upgrade pork value chains in Southern Myanmar
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - CONTEXT: Myanmar has made rapid economic progress since the country began its transition to a more integrated market economy in the late 2000s. Although these gains are led by positive developments in the agricultural sector, agricultural productivity and profitability are among the lowest in Asia with high rates of poverty especially in rural areas. Small-scale farms dominate rural livelihoods in Myanmar, especially for the 87% of Myanmar's poor who live in rural areas. Hence, these small-scale farms are critical development leverage points as they are an important source of rural incomes to both farm and non-farm households. OBJECTIVE: This study is part of a larger, five-year agricultural research and development project intended to upgrade pork and rice value chains and strengthen rural livelihoods in southern Myanmar's Tanintharyi Region. We evaluated producer-focused interventions to upgrade the pork value chain using tools that consider the dynamic , complex nature of the chain. METHODS: This research used systems thinking and participatory methods to develop a system dynamics model of the pork value chain in southern Myanmar. The model integrated modules of animal production, marketing, investment, finance , collective action. Scenario analysis with the model guided recommendations for pro -poor interventions for implementation within the five-year development project. RESULTS , CONCLUSIONS: Simulation results indicated that a mix of technical interventions implemented by functional producer groups showed promise in delivering sustained financial benefits to the target community and outperformed the short-term gains generated by these interventions in the absence of collective action. The model also highlighted specific interventions, such as improved financial services, animal health workers, and training that enabled poorer households to benefit from pig livelihoods while reducing risks from environmental and economic shocks. Within complex agri-food systems such as the pork value chain in Tanintharyi, a multi -pronged intervention strategy is recommended to address problems faced by small-scale agribusiness value chain participants. SIGNIFICANCE: Development interventions tend to be implemented in complex environments, often with scarce data to inform decision-making. This research shows how system dynamics tools and spatial group model building processes could help overcome these inherent challenges by creating virtual laboratories where plau-sible project interventions can be tested and modified, bringing increased confidence to implementation choices.

TI  - Roaming through the Maze of Maize in Northern Ghana. A Systems Approach to Explore the Long-Term Effects of a Food Security Intervention
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Central to food security interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa stands the value chain approach. The underlying idea is that connecting farmers to input and output markets and sources of knowledge and technology will enhance their food security status. In spite of positive impacts measured in especially food supply, there is scant evidence of the long-term effects on food security. For a better grasp of the impacts of a maize value chain intervention in North Ghana, we have experimented with an approach that focuses on interactions and feedback loops between the value chain and its local context. Such approach allowed us to identify dynamics that affect food security in the long run. In the case of Northern Ghana farming systems, household income and diets are increasingly dependent on maize, which increases risk of food insecurity in case of climate setbacks or market shocks. The exercise reveals how a linear value chain approach obscures the dynamic effects cascading from the intervention that may actually hamper food security in the long run. A systems approach may help to better grasp the consequences of external interventions at the local level.

TI  - Twists, turns and trade: A new look at the Indian Screw tree (Helicteres isora)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: This is the first study of global trade in fruits of the widely used traditional medicine, Helicteres isora L. It is used in Ayurvedic, Siddha, Unani medical systems and/or local folk traditional medicines in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. The roots are used in Traditional Chinese Medicines in China and the fruits in jamu products in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. In addition, H. isora fruits are also used in "traditional" medical systems far beyond the natural distribution of this species, for example in Zulu herbal medicine (South Africa) and Kurdish herbal medicines (Iraq).
   Aims of the study: This study had three aims: (i) to assess the global trade in H. isora fruits; (ii) to study the H. isora trade from West Timor to Java in terms of actors and prices along the value chain and (iii) to get a better understanding of the potential of this species to improve household income in eastern Indonesia.
   Materials and methods: This study uses historical records, a contemporary analysis of global trade data (2014-2016) and field assessments of value chains and the biological factors influencing H. isora fruit production.
   Results: Globally, the major exporter of H. isora fruits is India, which exports H. isora fruits to 19 countries, far beyond the natural geographical distribution of this species. Over a 36-month period (January 2014- December 2016), India exported 392 t of H. isora fruits, with a Free-On-Board (FOB) value of Indian rupiah (INR) 18,337,000 (US$ 274,055). This represents an average annual export quantity of about 130,526 kg/year. Over this three year period, most of these exports (85.5%) were to Indonesia (346.58 t), followed by Thailand (6.85%). Indian H. isora exports are also used in many other medical systems, including Kurdish and Zulu "traditional" medicines in Iraq and South Africa. Formation of an Indian diaspora in Bahrain, Mauritius, South Africa, Tanzania and Trinidad and Tobago over the past 130 years is one of the drivers of H. isora fruit trade outside the natural geographic distribution of the species. In Indonesia, demand for H. isora fruits is supplemented by an intra-island trade in Java and an inter-island trade from East Nusa Tenggara. West Timor, for example, exports around 31-37 t of air-dried H. isora fruits per year to Java. At the farm gate, local harvesters in West Timor get 4000 IDR (c. 0.3 US$) per kg, with businesses in Java paying 25,000 IDR (c.US$2) per kg for H. isora fruits. This is similar to the price paid for H. isora fruits imported from India to Java.
   Conclusions: India is the major exporter of whole dried H. isora fruits, including to countries where this species has never been in traditional use. In Indonesia, H. isora fruit extracts are used in the cosmetic industry as well as in jamu herbal medicines, including "Tolak Angin", the country's most popular commercial "jamu" preparation. Indonesia also is the major importer of H. isora fruits from India. In eastern Indonesia, improved income to local villagers from the H. isora fruit trade could come from improved H. isora fruit quality due to better drying techniques. This would also reduce health risks along the supply chain from to mycotoxins that have been recorded on poorly dried H. isora fruits. There also is an opportunity for cultivation of H. isora in small-holder teak plantations in Indonesia, with harvest of H. isora fruits as well as the medicinal bark.

TI  - Thinking beyond collateral in value chain lending: access to bank credit for smallholder Vietnamese bamboo and cinnamon farmers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Using case studies of the bamboo and cinnamon value chains in rural areas of northern Vietnam, this paper contributes to the existing literature by analyzing barriers and suggests conditions under which value chain lending would be an effective tool for improving smallholder farmers' access to credit. A mixed method using both in-depth interviews with relevant stakeholders and a two-stage Heckman model is employed to explain the existing credit gap. Findings show that in both chains, bank decision-making on lending is typically limited to individual chain actors instead of considering the whole chain. Commercial banks predominately use conventional lending approaches heavily dependent on collateral which typically results in a shortage of credit available to the chain actors. Value chain lending is constrained by weak chain linkages and limited ownership of private bank accounts. Drawing from these cases in Vietnam, the article concludes by arguing that status quo value chain lending in lower-income countries merits considerable rethinking. The lending approaches of banks require innovation to 'think beyond collateral' in improving chain cohesion. Multi-stakeholder partnerships are important for successful value chain lending. In addition, farmer-based unions have the potential to address issues of information asymmetry in the credit market.

TI  - Cooperative membership and coffee productivity in Rwanda's specialty coffee sector
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - This study uses data from 1,024 coffee producing households to address two critical questions regarding the role of cooperatives in Rwanda's coffee sector: Does cooperative membership increase adoption of best practices and coffee productivity? and do cooperatives improve farm household welfare? Using a propensity score matching technique to account for selection bias, we find that cooperatives are a critical institution for building farmer capacity, promoting adoption of improved technologies and inputs, and increasing productivity. We discuss the role that cooperatives can play in increasing farmer welfare and reestablishing the coffee sector as a pillar of growth in the country.

TI  - Upgrading the smallholder dairy value chain: a system dynamics ex-ante impact assessment in Tanzania's Kilosa district
T2  - JOURNAL OF DAIRY RESEARCH
AB  - This paper examines ex-ante impacts of two policy interventions that improve productivity of local-breed cows through artificial insemination (AI) and producers' access to distant markets through a dairy market hub. The majority of cattle in Kilosa district in Tanzania are local low productivity breeds kept by smallholders and agro-pastoralists. Milk production is seasonal, which constrains producers' access to distant urban markets, constrains producers' incomes and restricts profitability in dairy processing. We developed and evaluated an integrated system dynamics (SD) simulation model that captures many relevant feedbacks between the biological dynamics of dairy cattle production, the economics of milk market access, and the impacts of rainfall as an environmental factor. Our analysis indicated that in the short (1 year) and medium (5-year) term, policy interventions have a negative effect on producers' income due to high AI costs. However, in the long term (5+ years), producers' income from dairy cattle activities markedly increases (by, on average, 7% per year). The results show the potential for upgrading the smallholder dairy value chain in Kilosa, but achievement of this result may require financial support to producers in the initial stages (first 5 years) of the interventions, particularly to offset AI costs, as well as additional consideration of post-farm value chain costs. Furthermore, institutional aspects of dairy market hub have substantial effects on trade-offs amongst performance measures (e.g. higher profit vs. milk consumption at producer's household) with gain in cumulative profit coming at the expense of a proportional and substantial reduction in home milk consumption.

TI  - Intensification and Upgrading Dynamics in Emerging Dairy Clusters in the East African Highlands
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Based on farmer and value chain actor interviews, this comparative study of five emerging dairy clusters elaborates on the upgrading of farming systems, value chains, and context shapes transformations from semi-subsistent to market-oriented dairy farming. The main results show unequal cluster upgrading along two intensification dimensions: dairy feeding system and cash cropping. Intensive dairy is competing with other high-value cash crop options that resource-endowed farmers specialize in, given conducive support service arrangements and context conditions. A large number of drivers and co-dependencies between technical, value chain, and institutional upgrading build up to system jumps. Transformation may take decades when market and context conditions remain sub-optimal. Clusters can be expected to move further along initial intensification pathways, unless actors consciously redirect course. The main theoretical implications for debate about cluster upgrading are that co-dependencies between farming system, market, and context factors determine upgrading outcomes; the implications for the debate about intensification pathways are that they need to consider differences in farmer resource endowments, path dependency, concurrency, and upgrading investments. Sustainability issues for consideration include enabling a larger proportion of resource-poor farmers to participate in markets; enabling private input and service provision models; attention for food safety; and climate smartness.

TI  - Value chain analysis of wheat in Duna district, Hadiya zone, Southern Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Wheat is a source of food and income for Ethiopian farmers in general, and the Duna district in particular. Despite the district's high wheat production potential, a number of constraints impede the wheat sector's and value chain's development. This study, thus, analyzed the wheat value chain in Duna district, Hadiya zone, Southern Ethiopia. Descriptive statistics, marketing margin, and a multiple linear regression model were used to analyze data from 149 respondents. The result showed that the actors in the wheat value chain have a shaky relationship. According to the findings, flour wholesalers had the highest market margin (18.36%), followed by flour processors (17.70%). The estimated multiple linear regression result revealed that wheat supply is influenced by the quantity of wheat produced, household education level, farming experience, frequency of extension contact, and lagged market price. Furthermore, wheat producers identified climate variability and low wheat prices as the top two problems in wheat production and wheat marketing, respectively. Hence, the government and other concerned bodies should focus on productivity increasing technologies in the study area in order to boost productivity and thus increase wheat market supply. In addition, to solve the marketing problem, the promotion of value-added practices and the formation of wheat cooperatives are suggested.

TI  - A multidimensional perspective on child labor in the value chain: The case of the cocoa value chain in West Africa
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The International Labor Organization (ILO) states that most agricultural work carried out by children occurs within the family unit, is generally unpaid and often hazardous in its nature and/or in the circumstances in which it is carried out. At the same time, some scholars nuance this view by positing that children who work in agriculture in the spheres of their own household are not necessarily exploited. Making progress in addressing (worst forms of) child labor by value chain actors necessitates unpacking the complex dynamics, context and interlinkages that connect firms and farms at the local community level. This study responds to this call by proposing a new multidimensional perspective on child labor based on comparing and contrasting Global Value Chain (GVC) literature and the Sustainable Livelihood Approach (SLA). Adopting such a perspective allows for an explanation of both vertical dynamics, including global inter-firm linkages and power distribution, as well as horizontal dynamics, such as local norms and values, access to capitals and livelihood trajectories that contribute to the occurrence of child labor. This framework is illustrated by a case study on child labor in the cocoa value chain in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire, based on information obtained from a variety of sources, including 38 key informant interviews, 12 focus group discussions and structural observations. This study shows that children are not only factors of production, but are socially embedded in family structures and local communities. Children participate in a wider range of rural and agricultural activities as part of rural upbringing and learning a livelihood, in which not only harms but also benefits can occur. These findings advance the discussion by moving away from a dichotomy on child labor as a good or bad practice and putting the development opportunities of children center stage.

TI  - Organic cultivation and sustainable value chain development for tea smallholders: Findings from Assam, India
T2  - SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB  - Tea smallholders forma significant part of the global tea industry. They support the rural economy in several tea-producing regions in the world. However, their limited role in the tea value chain and numerous other issues pose major challenges to promote sustainability in the smallholders' tea sector. Of late, it has been observed that the adoption of organic cultivation has encouraged some of the tea smallholders to involve in the processing and marketing of tea, enabling the development of an alternative value chain. Based on the premise that value chain development is crucial to improve the smallholders' situation, we follow a mixed methods research approach to draw upon the recent developments in the tea sub-sector in Assam, India. The findings indicate the potential for the development of sustainable and inclusive value chain for the tea smallholders. However, such progress would requisite encouraging more growers to participate in the value chain, and mobilizing and organizing them towards collective actions through suitable institutional arrangements like producer organizations. Further, policy measures focusing on better governance of the smallholders' collectives, building trust, and creating value networks through strategic collaboration would be crucial to empower the growers and promote sustainability in the smallholders' tea production sector.

TI  - Mapping Nairobi's dairy food system: An essential analysis for policy, industry and research
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Demand for dairy products in sub-Saharan Africa, is expected to triple by 2050, while limited increase in supply is predicted. This poses significant food security risk to low income households. Understanding how the dairy food system operates is essential to identify mitigation measures to food insecurity impact. This study aims to determine the structure and functionality of Nairobi's dairy system using a value chain mapping approach.
   Primary data were gathered through focus group discussions and key informant interviews with dairy value chain stakeholders in Nairobi to obtain qualitative information on people and products in the chains while describing their interactions and flows. Qualitative thematic analysis combined with flowcharts created by participants enabled identification of key food system segments and the development of chain profiles (or flow-diagrams) which together form Nairobi's dairy system.
   Seven chain profiles forming Nairobi's dairy value chain were identified. These were found to be dominated by small-scale individuals who operate largely independently. Our profiles for the urban and peri-urban farming systems were structurally similar in their downstream networks, obtaining inputs from similar sources. Upstream, the urban systems were shorter, supplying mostly to immediate neighbours or based on own consumption, while the peri urban systems supplied to a wider network and showed some affiliations to producers' associations. Two distinct profiles characterize the milk flow from traders belonging either to a Dairy Traders Association (DTA) or those not belonging to this association (non-DTA). DTA traders sell mainly to fixed retailers and non-DTA traders to mobile retailers (hawkers or roadside vendors). Profiles associated with medium and large cooperatives were driven by networks of collection centres, but with medium-sized cooperatives selling half of their production to large processing companies, and large cooperatives only to fixed retailers. Large processing companies' profiles indicated distribution of high volumes and value addition processing. They reported strategic milk collection arrangements with suppliers on long, medium - or short - term contracts and with well-established product distribution channels.
   We have identified numerous inter-linkages across dairy chain profiles in Nairobi's complex system, demonstrating significant interdependency among the stakeholders. Therefore, enhancing the system's efficiency requires a holistic, system-wide approach and any policy interventions should consider every segment of the value chain. This study provides a methodological approach for organizations and policy makers to understand and address structural and functional vulnerabilities within food systems more broadly. The insights from this study are relevant to other rapidly growing cities in the region.

TI  - Linking small-scale farmers to the durum wheat value chain in Ethiopia: Assessing the effects on production and wellbeing
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Food security and agricultural-led industrialisation are pivotal development objectives in Ethiopia. One of the main challenges this country faces is increasing agricultural productivity by integrating smallholder farmers into a high-value agricultural commodity supply chain. This paper examines an integrated project-the Agricultural Value Chains Project in Oromia (AVCPO)-that aims to improve the livelihoods of smallholders in the Bale Zone by involving them in the production of high-quality durum wheat and linking them to the pasta industry via farmers' cooperatives. Using primary data collected in 2014 and retrospective information, this paper investigates the AVCPO's effects on the quantity of cereal production, the share of cereals that have been sold through cooperatives, food security, and education. In order to account for potential violations of the exclusion restriction assumption, an instrumental variable approach is applied, together with three additional estimation strategies.
   The results suggest that the project has had a large and positive effect on gross and net values of cereal production per hectare, as well as on the share of production sold to pasta makers through cooperatives. These benefits accrue equally to land-rich and land-poor farmers. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the AVCPO has improved educational outcomes and reduced food insecurity, without affecting crop rotation practices. Overall, our findings point to the effectiveness of the project. Before replicating or scaling up this intervention, however, it is necessary to understand how to better involve poorer farmers and which adjustments are needed if the areas selected have a lower potential than Bale Zone.

TI  - Cereal-Legume Value Chain Analysis: A Case of Smallholder Production in Selected Areas of Malawi
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - This article analyses the cereal-legume value chain in Malawi through a comprehensive VC Map, a SWOT exercise and a policy analysis. VC participation entails a number of challenges for smallholders. Limited access to land, technology and inputs, inadequate knowledge of market functioning, insufficient access to credit and extension services, combined with more general problems of poor infrastructures, often prevent smallholder farmers from accessing profitable market opportunities. The effectiveness of national policies (e.g., public extension service support, inputs subsidy system) oriented to increase smallholders' market access is often constrained by inadequate financial capacity, an inefficient public extension services system and limited involvement of privates in the extension services scheme. VC interventions should distinguish between VC-ready farmers, namely those provided with the minimum conditions of external and internal factors, and non-value-chain-ready farmers. Market-based interventions (e.g., enhancing VC coordination) are needed for enhancing market access of value-chain-ready farmers. Conversely, while non-market-based interventions (e.g., investments in basic infrastructure, increasing extension services, credit and inputs access) prove necessary to build the minimum asset thresholds for non-value-chain-ready farmers' participation in the market. A smallholder-friendly VC development relies on the role played by VC actors and the need to harmonise and improve existing policies to remove inadequacies, conflicts and overlaps in the various institutions charged with implementation.

TI  - Climate change adaptation options in rainfed upland cropping systems in the wet tropics: A case study of smallholder farms in North-West Cambodia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - While climate change is confirmed to have serious impacts on agricultural production in many regions worldwide, researchers have proposed various measures that farmers can apply to cope with and adapt to those changes. However, it is often the case that not every adaptation measure would be practical and adoptable in a specific region. Farmers may have their own ways of managing and adapting to climate change that need to be taken into account when considering interventions. This study aimed to engage with farmers to: (1) better understand small-holder knowledge, attitudes and practices in relation to perceived or expected climate change; and (2) document cropping practices, climate change perceptions, constraints to crop production, and coping and adaptation options with existing climate variability and expected climate change. This study was conducted in 2015 in Sala Krau village near Pailin (12 degrees 52'N, 102 degrees 45'E) and Samlout (12 degrees 39'N, 102 degrees 36'E) of North-West Cambodia. The methods used were a combination of focus group discussions and one-on-one interviews where 132 farming households were randomly selected. We found that farmers were conscious of changes in climate over recent years, and had a good understanding of likely future changes. While farmers are aware of some practices that can be modified to minimize risk and cope with anticipated changes, they are reluctant to apply them. Furthermore; there are no government agricultural extension services provided at the village level and farmers have relied on each other and other actors in the value chain network for information to support their decision-making. There is a lack of knowledge of the principles of conservation agriculture that urgently require agricultural extension services in the region to build farmer ability to better cope and adapt to climate change.

TI  - Using a Value Chain Approach to Map the Pig Production System in Rwanda, Its Governance, and Sanitary Risks
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - Rwanda has a fast growing pig production sector projected to continue expansion, due to rising local and regional demand. We undertook a value chain analysis to establish the flows of pigs and pork in Rwanda and the roles of various actors involved, and to understand governance and sanitary risks in the value chain. Cross-sectional qualitative data were collected through focus group discussions and key informant interviews with farmers, brokers, butchers, abattoir managers, and veterinarians. Data were collected on pig production methods and inputs, the source and destination of live and slaughtered pigs, value-adding infrastructures (abattoirs and processing factories), the people involved and interactions between them, governance, and challenges. Pig production in Rwanda is dominated by smallholders, mainly as a source of supplementary income and secondarily for manure. Emerging medium-sized and large pig farms were also identified, located mainly around urban areas. Live pig markets are the main mechanism allowing various actors to buy/sell pigs. Brokers have an important role in pig transactions: they are key in setting prices at markets, examining pigs for disease, organising the supply of pigs for abattoirs and for export. Only a few formal pig abattoirs were identified, which mainly supply to pork processing factories based in Kigali and/or export to customers. Local consumers rely on informal slaughtering at farm or bar/restaurant backyards, with irregular veterinary inspection. Formal abattoirs were attended by a veterinary inspector, however a lack of record keeping was noted. Sanitary risks identified were a lack of biosecurity throughout the chain and poor hygiene at slaughter places. Lingual palpation was practised in pig markets to identify cysticercosis infection, however cyst-positive pigs were not destroyed, but were sold for reduced prices in the same market or later informally sold by the owner. There are few veterinarians attending farms, with most services provided by less qualified technicians or self-treatment of pigs by farmers. Overall, this production system is characterised by a high degree of informality at all nodes, combined with the rapid growth trajectory in the sector. These findings provide a basis to plan interventions tailored to vulnerabilities identified in the Rwanda pig value chain.

TI  - Prevention and Control of African Swine Fever in the Smallholder Pig Value Chain in Northern Uganda: Thematic Analysis of Stakeholders' Perceptions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is endemic in Uganda and considered a major constraint to pig production. In the absence of a vaccine, biosecurity is key for ASF prevention and control. To improve prevention and control on farm and community level there is need for more knowledge on current application of biosecurity practises, and better understanding of how pig value chain actors perceive prevention and control. To achieve this, a qualitative interview study involving focus group discussions (FGD) was conducted with actors from the smallholder pig value chain in northern Uganda. Six villages were purposively selected based on previous outbreaks of ASF, preliminary perceived willingness to control ASF, and the representation of several different value chain actors in the village. Results indicated that biosecurity practises such as basic hygiene routines including safe carcass handling, minimising direct and indirect contacts between pigs or between pigs and people, trade restrictions and sharing of disease information were implemented in some of the villages. Thematic analysis based on grounded theory revealed six categories of data relating to ASF prevention and control. Together these categories form a logical framework including both enablers and hindrances for ASF prevention and control. In summary participants mostly had positive perceptions of ASF biosecurity, describing measures as effective. Participants further possessed knowledge of ASF and its transmission, some of which was in line with known scientific knowledge and some not. Nevertheless, participants were hindered from preventing and controlling ASF due to biosecurity costs and a need to prioritise family livelihood over disease transmission risks, incompatibility of current biosecurity practises with local culture, traditions and social contexts and finally lack of access to veterinarians or, occasionally, low-quality veterinary services. The constraints could be addressed by applying participatory processes in designing biosecurity measures to ensure better adaptation to local cultural and social contexts.

TI  - Understanding fish production and marketing systems in North-western Nigeria and identification of potential food safety risks using value chain framework
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - Fish production systems in North-western Nigeria have a significant role in food, nutrition and income generations to families, yet an important setup for zoonotic disease transmission. The aim of this study was to provide a broad knowledge of the structure, activities and food safety risks of the fish value chains operating in North-western Nigeria using the value chain framework. A total of 16 focus groups and 8 key informant interviews were conducted to gather data from fish producers, fish sellers and fish processors in selected periurban and rural settlements in Kaduna State. In addition, 129 semi-structured questionnaires and observation checklists were used in this study to gather evidence-based data, such as demography of value chain actors, product characterization, and food safety risks.
   The fish value-chain in North-western Nigeria is characterised by four main stakeholders, namely, fish producers, transporters, as well as raw-and processed-fish-sellers (wholesalers, retailers). Two major sources were identified supplying farmed fish to North-western Nigeria: the distributors from the central and southern part of the country and the fish farmers within the North-western and North-eastern regions of Nigeria. Raw-fish wholesalers within the two major markets sold most of their high-value products to raw-fish-retailers, while low-value products were routed to raw-fish-retailers in the rural communities, processed-fish-retailers and household consumers in rural settlements. There were no large companies operating and no differentiation of chains between aquaculture and wild fishery. Raw fishes not sold and began to rot were sold to street vendors at a cheaper price and household consumers.
   Fish production and supply chains were characterised by poor structural and sanitary support for food safety and hygiene measures. Food safety risks identified were related to lack of biosecurity measures in fish farms, lack of cold chain and access to running water, poor hygiene practices by all handlers, lack of fish inspection at all levels, lack of use of protective clothing and limited health inspection of handlers.
   In overall, government control of activities in fish value chains was relatively poor leading to the absence of food safety regulatory enforcement characterised by lack of institutional goals on improving food safety measures in a chain-wide distribution. Hence, this study points the significant structural, sanitary and hygiene limitations along the fish value chain components. It provides a baseline for microbial food safety risk assessments, and information required for policy-making regarding implementation of disease control programmes, as the sector is fast-evolving in Sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - The Key Factors Affecting Tree Producer Associations Involved in Private Commercial Forestry in Kenya
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Formal tree producer associations are critical for the sustainable management of private commercial farm forests in Kenya. However, there is limited information on their current status and the key factors driving their operations in the country. This paper sought to address this informational gap by reviewing the existing literature in the country from the theoretical background of sustainable development and later validating the obtained findings with the current state of knowledge at regional and global levels. Results from document content analysis indicate that there are over 10,000 tree growing farmers organized into planting groups across the country after many years of piloting by the government and private sector players. At the national level, there are two associations. These include Kenya Forest Growers Association (KEFGA), mainly composed of large scale planters, and Farm Forestry Smallholder Producers Association of Kenya (FFSPAK), targeting small-holders. Besides these two, six major sub-national associations are seeking to improve members' welfare by enhancing the acquisition of livelihood assets. Further, various socio-cultural, economic, and political factors affect their operations in Kenya. These associations have deployed multiple strategies to benefit their members. However, the formation of savings and credit cooperative societies (SACCOs) seems to be their preferred mode of community empowerment. In conclusion, even though these associations are still at the infancy stage, their future remains promising in-view of the observed behavioral change in their governance, which appears to favor entrenched equality and equity towards sustainable development.

TI  - Evaluating the Impacts of Smallholder Farmer's Participation in Modern Agricultural Value Chain Tactics for Facilitating Poverty Alleviation-A Case Study of Kiwifruit Industry in Shaanxi, China
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Market-based initiatives like agriculture value chain (AVC) are becoming progressively pervasive to support smallholder rural farmers and assist them in entering larger market interventions and providing a pathway of enhancing their socioeconomic well-being. Moreover, it may also foster staggering effects towards the post-era poverty alleviation in rural areas and possessed a significant theoretical and practical influence for modern agricultural development. The prime objective of the study is to explore the effects of smallholder farmers' participation in the agricultural value chain for availing rural development and poverty alleviation. Specifically, we have crafted the assessment employing pre-production (improved fertilizers usage), in-production (modern preservation technology), and post-production (supply chain) participation and interventions of smallholder farmers. The empirical data has been collected from a micro survey dataset of 623 kiwifruit farmers from July to September in Shaanxi, China. We have employed propensity score matching (PSM), probit, and OLS models to explore the multidimensional poverty reduction impact and heterogeneity of farmers' participation in the agricultural value chain. The results show that the total number of poor farmers who have experienced one-dimensional and two-dimensional poverty is relatively high (66.3%). We also find that farmers' participation in agricultural value chain activities has a significant poverty reduction effect. The multidimensional poverty level of farmers using improved fertilizer, organizational acquisition, and using storage technology (compared with non-participating farmers) decreased by 30.1%, 46.5%, and 25.0%, respectively. The multidimensional poverty reduction degree of male farmers using improved fertilizer and participating in the organizational acquisition is greater than that of women. The multidimensional poverty reduction degree of female farmers using storage and fresh-keeping technology has a greater impact than the males using storage and improved storage technology. Government should widely promote the value chain in the form of pre-harvest, production, and post-harvest technology. The public-private partnership should also be strengthened for availing innovative technologies and infrastructure development.

TI  - Food value chain linkages and household food security in Tanzania
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - This article investigates smallholder market linkages in food value chains in sub-Saharan Africa, using Tanzania as a case study. Specifically, we analysed the status and drivers of market linkages among farmers, and their impact on agricultural income and food security. The analysis is based on nationally representative household survey data, using a combination of descriptive statistics and econometric approaches. Although most farmers in Tanzania are integrated into agricultural markets, their level of commercialization is very low, with an average of only 30% of their crop production sold. Around 15% of farmers who sell crops have access to potentially more rewarding market linkages (e.g. through cooperatives or contract farming). The econometric results show that, controlling for a number of confounding factors, farmers with market linkages are more commercialized, and receive significantly higher producer prices and crop income than those without such linkages. However, in spite of these positive results, we did not find significant differences in terms of household food security.

TI  - The political economy of agriculture for development today: the "small versus large" scale debate revisited
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - The role of agriculture in economic development and the development politics of promoting smallholder versus large-scale agriculture have both been at the center of a long-lasting and controversial debate. Using an innovative methodology which combines a value chain approach with input-output-analysis, the growth multipliers and productivity of both farm types in Guatemala are analyzed. Results show that smallholder agriculture has the same potential to stimulate output growth as large-scale agriculture. Smallholder value chains include mainly informal sectors and create more jobs than commercial agriculture. Therefore, a reorientation of agricultural and land policies toward small-scale food producers and within a comprehensive policy of integrated rural development is not only necessary in terms of social equity but also for boosting economic development.

TI  - The challenge of upgrading white shrimp production in central Vietnam and the potential of farming cooperatives
T2  - ERDE
AB  - Aquaculture in Vietnam expanded significantly over the past two decades and contributed to poverty alleviation among smallholders. Upstream value chains of shrimp farming in Vietnam are characterized by a high degree of informality, a high number of intermediate layers in trade and power asymmetries between farmers, suppliers and buyers. Input supply such as feed and fingerlings for shrimps account for 60% to 80% of overall cost in white shrimp production. Reducing the cost of input supply would therefore significantly improve income and welfare of farmers. Hence, this study focuses on the characteristics of business relationships between farmers and input suppliers and explores the possibilities of farmers to improve their bargaining position. In particular, the potential of horizontal coordination in the form of cooperatives is evaluated. Characteristics of business relationships and possibilities to (individually and collectively) improve their bargaining positions of farmers are evaluated within the conceptual frame of global value chains and upgrading. The paper argues that despite previous unsuccessful attempts to establish cooperatives, horizontal coordination is an important measure in order to counter high dependencies from supply agents. However, in order to be successful, attempts to coordinate need a clear value proposition for farmers, engagement and communication among farmers and government support in funding the necessary infrastructure.

TI  - Contingent spaces for smallholder participation in GlobalGAP: insights from Kenyan horticulture value chains
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Private standards initiatives (PSIs) in agri-food value chains raise questions of democratic governance and accountability relating to the voice and agency of those whom the standards are designed to benefit or whom they most affect. We employ the concept of 'spaces for participation' to analyse participation in a particular PSI, GlobalGAP, and assess how, and to what extent, it opens up a space for debate about what constitutes good practice in agri-food chains and for whom. We draw on focus groups with smallholders, together with semi-structured interviews and workshops held with actors at the national and international scales to examine PSIs operating in Kenyan export horticulture to examine good agricultural practice (GAP) standards. Our analysis suggests that despite public announcements that these initiatives promote the voice of the farmer, the direct participation of farmers is largely absent from these policy spaces at present. This is related to the way in which invitations to the spaces for participation are constructed, what is deemed to be appropriate subjects for discussion in PSIs as well as the practical challenges associated with the organisation of farmers across spatial scales. The spaces for participation are located largely at the international and national scales with few connections to the local scale. This paper contributes to an extension of value chain analysis that re-asserts the importance of institutional context and how value chains are embedded in particular socio-economic and political systems.

TI  - Smallholder Farmer Perceptions of Postharvest Loss and Its Determinants in Fijian Tomato Value Chains
T2  - HORTICULTURAE
AB  - The Fiji Islands, like many small Pacific island nations, are thought to incur high rates of postharvest loss. Little work has been undertaken to quantify the amount of loss within Pacific horticultural value chains, or identify the key determinants. This study sought to quantify postharvest loss within Fijian smallholder tomato value chains and to examine the relative importance of current on-farm practices as possible contributors to this loss. A semi-structured survey of 115 smallholder tomato farmers in Sigatoka Valley and eastern Viti Levu was undertaken, covering socio-economic and demographic parameters, production and postharvest handling practice, and postharvest loss based on farmer recall. On-farm postharvest loss for smallholder farmer tomato value chains was between 26.1% in Sigatoka Valley and 27.6% in eastern Viti Levu. This finding was consistent with quantification of postharvest loss in Fijian tomato chains by direct determination, but is relatively high when compared to smallholder tomato value chain loss in Sub-Saharan Africa. When Fijian tomato value chains were segregated according to specific postharvest handling practice, the contributors to postharvest loss were often associated with on-farm decision-making. Those value chains that only harvested once a week, or in the early morning (before 7 am) or mid-day onwards, stored harvest product in the field for more than three hours, did not sort or grade prior to on-farm ripening, or used packing sheds that had relatively open designs, all had consistently higher levels of postharvest loss. The prevalence of specific postharvest handling practice in both locations is further reported. While this study highlights the impact of current on-farm postharvest handling practices on tomato value chain loss, what remain unclear are the underlying drivers associated with current postharvest handling behaviour and the decision-making that shapes quality and logistic control activities.

TI  - Mobile money adoption, input use, and farm output among smallholder rice farmers in Ghana
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - Financial exclusion continues to be a major challenge to smallholder farmers' participation in agricultural value chains in developing countries. Digitizing procurements and other forms of transactions using mobile money technology among value chain actors is essential for ensuring financial inclusion and enhancing agricultural value chain transformation. This study examines the factors influencing the adoption of mobile money technology and the impact of the technology on production input use and farm output, utilizing data from a cross-sectional survey of smallholder rice farmers in northern Ghana. A linear regression with endogenous treatment effects method is employed to account for both observable and unobservable selection bias. The results reveal positive and significant marginal effect of mobile money technology on input use and farm output. Adopters of the technology applied 18% and 13% more fertilizer and herbicides, respectively than nonadopters. The output increased by about 4% for the adopters. The results also show that mobile money technology adoption, input use and farm output are significantly influenced by education, farmer-based organization (FBO) membership, access to credit, input prices, and location fixed effects. Expansion of mobile technology networks, increased investment in education, credit facilities, and FBOs can be quite relevant in promoting the adoption of mobile money technology in Ghana.

TI  - Is the marine finfish cage farming value chain in Cambodia inclusive?
T2  - AQUACULTURE
AB  - We undertook a gendered value chain analysis of marine finfish cage farming in Cambodia, interviewing 50 farmers and 11 other value chain participants, focussing on one of the key social concerns: inclusivity. The study used a modified participatory value chain mapping approach starting with the production/farming unit (household or a small producer company) and then 'snowballing' up and down the value chain. We specifically targeted participation of women, youths and minorities. The results showed that women and men were represented equally in several value chain nodes, namely: farmers, farm materials suppliers, and traders with special orders. Middle-aged men predominated as wholesalers and fingerlings traders, while women were predominant as 'trash' fish traders and local market traders of farmed fish. Only men, of all ages, were reported as fishers for the 'trash' fish supply. Youths of both sexes were present in feed (fishing or trading) nodes, and several of the local market traders were young women. In terms of the farming and the farm materials nodes, youths were present as offspring who were in the process of taking over the business over from the parents. This appears to be one of the few opportunities for youths to enter marine finfish cage farming, because the cost of farm establishment and selection of suitable farming sites were identified as barriers to entry to this industry. We found that most farms were perceived as being family owned, in contrast to literature reports that mariculture farmers as predominantly men. Our findings reinforce that information on inclusivity in aquaculture value chains is essential to planning any interventions aimed at improving returns and increasing efficiency.

TI  - Assessing Smallholder Farmer's Participation in the Wheat Value Chain in North-West Mt. Kenya
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Wheat is the second most important carbohydrate staple in Kenya and is produced by both smallholder and large-scale farmers. Smallholders are the majority, but produce <20% of the total national production. Compared to large-scale farmers, they have been considered to be less efficient producers and thus fail to benefit fully from their participation in the wheat value chain. This study aims at establishing the value accruing to smallholder and large-scale farmers participating in wheat production in north-westMt. Kenya. For comparative purposes and to explore the potential of smallholder farmers, a sample of 58 smallholder and seven large-scale farmers was selected for the study. We use budget analysis to determine the gross output, cost of production and gross margins attained by the smallholder and large-scale farmers. Further, an analysis of constraints to productivity is done to establish the factors hindering farmers from reaching high yield potential. Results of the study show that smallholder farmers obtain lower yields, have higher costs of production per bag of wheat and lower gross margins compared to large-scale farmers. High cost of inputs, low market prices, low bargaining power, high cost of machinery services, diseases and weeds were among factors excluding smallholder farmers from benefitting from their participation in the value chain. However, results also show that smallholder farmers can produce wheat profitably albeit with necessary support. Thus, interventions should consider these constraints and aim at improving smallholder farmers' horizontal and vertical integration in the value chain. We recommend continued investment in research and development on wheat, adoption of climate resilient agricultural practices, improvements in the fertilizer subsidy programme and creating or increasing participation in producer groups that will provide possibilities of increased bargaining power and reduction of costs through improved access to machinery services, markets and credit.

TI  - The integration of smallholders in agricultural value chain activities and food security: evidence from rural Tanzania
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - The integration of smallholders into agricultural value chains is considered an important pathway for raising the welfare of farmers, including their food security. Distinct from literature that has mainly dwelt on smallholder integration in high-value and export-orientated agricultural value chains (AVCs), we focus on domestic, traditional AVCs, which are relevant to the majority of smallholders. Using primary household data from Kilosa and Chamwino districts in rural Tanzania, we examined the nature and extent of smallholder participation in traditional AVC activities and their associated welfare effects, focusing primarily on household food security. Cluster analysis was used to explore different smallholder livelihood activities and the extent of participation in traditional AVCs while propensity score matching and inverse probability weighted regression adjustment approaches were employed to analyze food security effects of various AVC activities. Results revealed that smallholders participate at varying levels in different AVC activities and their integration in traditional AVCs plays an important role in improving food security. Whereas other studies analyze only the impacts of participation in single AVC activities, we show the relevance of assessing the effects of multiple AVC activities on food security. Findings highlight the importance of promoting policies that enable effective vertical and horizontal integration of smallholder farmers into traditional AVC activities for enhanced food security and improved livelihoods.

TI  - Biofuels for a Greener Economy? Insights from Jatropha Production in Northeastern Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Many observers view Jatropha as a miracle plant that grows in harsh environments, halts land degradation and provides seeds for fuel production. This makes it particularly attractive for use in Ethiopia, where poverty levels are high and the degradation of agricultural land is widespread. In this article, we investigate the potentials and limitations of a government-initiated Jatropha project for smallholders in northeastern Ethiopia from a green economy perspective. Data are based on a 2009 household survey and interviews with key informants, as well as on a 2012 follow-up round of interviews with key informants. We conclude that the project has not contributed to a greener economy so far, but has the potential to do so in the future. To maximize Jatropha's potential, interventions must focus mainly on smallholders and pay more attention to the entire biofuel value chain.

TI  - Market Channels for Highland Bamboo Poles Originated from Hula District, Sidama Zone Southern Ethiopia
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - Ethiopia is one of the countries well-endowed with bamboo (Arundinaria alpine, a highland bamboo, and Oxytenanthera abyssinica, a lowland bamboo species). As compared to its potential, however, the contribution of bamboo to producer livelihoods and the national economy is very low. This paper describes the bamboo production-consumption system in the Hula district of Sidama Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Data include primary and secondary sources. The primary data were collected from 160 farmers, 38 traders and 30 consumers using household surveys, key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Data were then analyzed using a value chain analysis. In the district, all households produced bamboo and allocated on average of 1/6 of their total land holding to bamboo production. Bamboo poles, the primary products, were identified as differentiated products in the market based on length, diameter, circumference, and the intended use of the poles into four major types. In 2014, 26,825 poles of Type 1 bamboo were harvested followed by 25,269 poles of Type 2. The amount harvested from Type 3 and Type 4 bamboos were 17,661 and 20,090 poles, respectively. The value chain analysis revealed that the major actors in the production to consumption system of bamboo were farmers, brokers, wholesalers, craftsmen, house constructors and domestic users. The results indicated that each type has a distinct value chain, with differentiated pricing and use pattern. The major limiting factors identified included absence of value added production and poor market linkage. This study supports the need for further research and investment in value added production alternatives and improved market access. Policies that support farmers' access to modern production systems, establishment of cooperatives and improved extension system will also likely to accelerate the efficiency and effectiveness of the value chain.

TI  - An assessment of broiler value chain in Nigeria
T2  - OPEN AGRICULTURE
AB  - Livestock sub-sector of agriculture plays a vital role in the development of emerging economies in terms of provision of high quality protein and employment generation through its value chain activities. Yet, little is known about value chain development in this important sub-sector of the Nigeria economy. Hence, this study assessed Broiler Value Chain (BVC) in Nigeria. Primary data were collected from various actors along the value chain between November 2017 and March, 2018. Nigeria BVC is relatively simple with only five main actors. Grandparent Stock (GPS) farmers supply breeder Day Old Chicks (DOCs) to Parent Stock (PS) farmers. PS farmers supply commercial DOCs to commercial broiler farmers. Commercial farmers sell mature broilers to mature live broiler marketers (63%) and processors (37%). Processors sell processed meat to household consumers (12%) and 88% to fast food outlets, hotels, restaurants, and supermarkets with no export who in turn sell to individual and household consumers. High cost of feed, lack of credit facilities, and weak infrastructure were the major constraints facing production, marketing, and processing of broilers, respectively. Policies aiming at the development of BVC should focus on low/no export of broiler meat and high import of materials as well as other constraints.

TI  - Agricultural innovation platforms in West Africa How does strategic institutional entrepreneurship unfold in different value chain contexts?
T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - Inspired by innovation system theory, donors promote innovation platforms (IPs) to enhance collaboration for development. However, IP practice and impact are diverse: hence the question arises of whether and how IP approaches are able to create institutional change for the benefit of smallholders. The authors present the experience of an action research programme in West Africa and analyse the cases from a dialectic perspective on institutional entrepreneurship. The results show that a researcher-initiated open IP approach with clear principles and in-depth analysis of the value chain context is able to create reasonably effective IP coalitions for smallholder development. In a mature value chain, it may be possible to mobilize high-level actors, but IPs often start at a lower level and apply a two-pronged approach. They focus primarily on research and communication to improve smallholder technical and entrepreneurial practices, while diligently mobilizing high-level actors to attain critical regulatory and/or market support. Mobilization success is limited in contentious environments.

TI  - Linking Household Food Security and Food Value Chains in North West Mt. Kenya
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Smallholder farmers and pastoralists produce the largest proportion of food consumed in sub-Saharan Africa. However, they remain among the food insecure populations. This paper explores the food (in)security among smallholder farmers and pastoralists using a sample of 175 households in three agro-food value chains of wheat, dairy, and beef in the north-west Mt. Kenya region. The study seeks to answer if a farmer's participation in a particular agro-food value chain determines his/her food security situation. We use the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) and two Poisson regression models, parsimonious and full, to assess the household food security status and determinants of food security among the smallholder farmers and pastoralists. The results show that 61% of the households were either mildly, moderately, or severely food insecure. Households in the beef value chain experienced relatively higher incidences of food insecurity compared to households in the wheat and dairy value chains. The HFIAS scores revealed a wide gap between households with minimum and maximum score. Household size, income and income-related variables (ability to save and borrow to meet family needs), transport assets, membership in farmers' associations, and household energy were significant in determining household food security, while access to credit and to extension services was not. Strategies that focus on boosting smallholder farmers' incomes, building strong and resilient farmers associations to improve inclusive and equitable value chains have the potential to get smallholder farmers out of recurrent food insecurity.

TI  - Sustainability and Gender Dynamics of Coffee Value-Chain Development Intervention: Lessons from Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study examines sustainability and gender dynamics of coffee value-chain development intervention in Ethiopia. The data were collected from male and female farmers and other stakeholders using key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and a questionnaire survey. The study found that some of the introduced technologies/practices were adopted and sustained whereas others were dropped or adapted depending on technical, institutional, and socio-economic factors. The value-chain intervention was generic and not gender-sensitive. Although the intervention generated positive changes and benefits for all household members (by improving coffee quality, market access, and their income), it had mixed outcomes for women. Although women were not primarily targeted by the intervention, their increased involvement in coffee harvesting and processing fostered women's skills, confidence, and decision-making power. However, some of the new technologies/practices required additional labour, while others were labour saving and eased their work. As a result of increasing the wholesale trading of coffee, the role for marketing largely shifted to men. This study underscores the need for a proper gender analysis and embedding gender-sensitive approaches in designing development interventions to ensure women's fair representation, and thus equitable and sustainable benefits. Such efforts should entail a paradigm shift from production to promoting women's role and integration into the entire value chain, as well as improving their access to productive resources and services. Moreover, value-chain development interventions should consider technical, institutional, social, and economic factors that could influence their effectiveness and sustainability.

TI  - Social network analysis of practice adoption facing outbreaks of African Swine Fever
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - Animal epizootics show widely destructive effect on livestock value chains in sub Saharan Africa, pushing many smallholders into poverty and discouraging investments. Hence, African swine fever (ASF) has been playing a deeply depressing role on swine value chain of Benin since its first occurrence in the country in 1997. Exchanges between actors are fundamental among stakeholders for the overall performance of a value chain and is key in the way these can respond to challenges, as epizootic threats. The present study describes how stakeholders of the swine value chain interact in the diffusion of innovative practices facing an outbreak of ASF. In seven districts, focus groups were first organized with stakeholders to identify changes and other reactions that ensued from a recent ASF outbreak in Benin. In a second step, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted, following a respondent-driven sampling, to collect the contact information needed for social network analysis. The influence of actors' characteristics on their degree centrality was tested through multiple linear regression model. Regulatory requirements and available incomes facilitated practice diffusion among groups of pork butchers, traders/brokers and input suppliers. Stockbreeders displayed passivity in the diffusion of practices whereas they should have the forefront role in addressing the challenge of ASF. Nevertheless, their significant interest in capacity reinforcement, associations, exchange visits and professionalization may lead them to increase their involvement in a joint control of the disease.

TI  - Hiding in plain sight: the emergence of modern dairy farms in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose This paper provides one of the first and most detailed accounts of the large modern dairy farms that are emerging in the dairy sector in India. Qualitative interviews are used to understand how these farms differ from their traditional smallholder counterparts and how well integrated they are into the value chains. Design/methodology/approach Snowball sampling was used to identify large farmers. In total, 49 in-depth interviews were conducted with large commercial modern farms in Punjab. A detailed description of the main characteristics of these modern dairy farms is provided. Data from previous studies conducted in Punjab is used to compare the new farms with traditional smallholder farms. Findings The modern dairy farms are much more advanced in their use of technology compared to their traditional counterparts. These large commercial modern farms are very well integrated into the value chains. They often, but not exclusively, sell milk to formal supply chains, sometimes on a contractual basis. Originality/value Most of the literature on the Indian dairy sector focuses on smallholders. However, understanding and acknowledging the emergence of modern dairy farms is very important in understanding the development of value chains not only in the dairy sector in India, but in domestic food sectors in developing countries in general. This qualitative data analysis is a necessary first step if more large-scale representative information is to be collected in the future.

TI  - What is technology adoption? Exploring the agricultural research value chain for smallholder farmers in Lao PDR
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - A common and driving assumption in agricultural research is that the introduction of research trials, new practices and innovative technologies will result in technology adoption, and will subsequently generate benefits for farmers and other stakeholders. In Lao PDR, the potential benefits of introduced technologies have not been fully realised by beneficiaries. We report on an analysis of a survey of 735 smallholder farmers in Southern Lao PDR who were questioned about factors that influenced their decisions to adopt new technologies. In this study, we have constructed measures or states of adoption which identify key elements of an adoption decision-making nexus. Analysis was conducted to statistically group explanatory factors of adoption. The key explanatory factors represented attributes of the farmer, the factors considered when undertaking production decisions and elements of the agricultural value chain that present as opportunities or constraints. We describe the combination of farmer's personal attributes, perceptions of the value chain, and the introduction of new technologies by external actors as an "agricultural research value chain", where agricultural research activities intervene to derive greater benefits for local farmers. A generalised linear model, via Poisson (multiple) regression analysis on the identified explanatory factors, was applied to explore how they influence adoption measures and we found several significant relationships.

TI  - Value Chain Analysis of Eucalyptus Wood Products in the Blue Nile Highlands of Northwestern Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Eucalyptus wood products contribute significantly to the income of smallholder growers in many parts of Ethiopia. This has incentivized smallholders to convert arable lands to Eucalyptus plantation. Given the limited attention and availability of empirical evidence, this study examined the Eucalyptus wood products value chain in terms of the actors engaged, the type and importance of channels, margins analysis and the overall value chain governance in the main Eucalyptus growing areas of the Blue Nile highlands of Northwestern Ethiopia in 2019/2020. Sources of data were randomly selected 388 Eucalyptus grower households and 166 Eucalyptus wood traders, complemented by an interview with key informants, group discussions and direct observations. The results reveal that a total of 2,051,114.75 m(3) of Eucalyptus wood was produced in the study area and Eucalyptus plantations are expanding over crop lands at a rate of 102.35 ha a year on average. Many actors involved handle a large volume of wood in eight main channels with a high disparity in the shares of the margins. We found that Eucalyptus is the main source of cash earning, contributing about 45.76% to the total annual income of smallholder growers. Little policy attention, a lack of sectoral integration, missing infrastructure and an absence of modern wood processing factories are among the key challenges impeding the performance of the wood sector value chain. There are however existing opportunities for the development of the wood sector value chain such as favorable growing conditions and the spectacular growing demand for wood products. The study provides valuable insights about the wood sector value chain and actions towards ensuring sustainable value chains and the commercialization of the sector.

TI  - Linking small farmers to modern retail through producer organizations - Experiences with producer companies in India
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Since the early 2000s, India's agro-food sector has undergone rapid transformations towards greater market share of modern food retail. This has impacted Indian agriculture and farmers as supermarkets reorganize supply chains towards more explicit forms of coordination. Compared to other developing countries, little has been said in the Indian context about what role farmer organizations can play to help smallholder farmers specifically, improve their position in those emerging value chains. In this paper, I address this gap and demonstrate that producer companies are a promising tool to strengthen famers' position in their relationship with supermarket chains in India, but one which needs further improvement.

TI  - Food Safety Perceptions and Practices among Smallholder Pork Value Chain Actors in Hung Yen Province, Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION
AB  - Pork safety is an important public health concern in Vietnam and is a shared responsibility among many actors along the pork value chain. We examined the knowledge, perceptions, and practices regarding food safety, disease, and health risk among selected pork value chain actors (slaughterhouse owners and workers, people living around slaughterhouses, pork sellers, consumers, and veterinary and public health staff) in three districts in Hung Yen Province, Vietnam. We randomly selected 52 pork value chain actors to be surveyed through questionnaires, observation checklists, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions. Most slaughterhouse workers acquired knowledge and experience of food safety through "learning by doing" rather than from training by a veterinary or public health professional. Both slaughterhouse worker and pork seller groups had some accurate perceptions about pig diseases and foodbome diseases; however, misperceptions of risk and, especially, of zoonoses were present. Furthermore, while workers and sellers often use cloths to dry the meat and clean equipment, they did not think this was a risk for meat contamination. Moreover, when sellers wear protective equipment, such as gloves, masks, or hats, consumers perceive that the sellers may have health issues they are trying to conceal and so consumers avoid buying from them. The perceived freshness of pork, along with trust in the seller and in the pork production process, were strong indicators of consumer preference. And yet, pork value chain actors tend to trust their own individual food safety practices more, rather than the practices of other actors along the chain. Veterinary and public health staff emphasized the gap between regulations and food safety practices. Education and training on food safety risks and proper handling are priorities, along with integrated and intensive efforts to improve food safety among pork value chain actors.

TI  - Agriculture value chain sustainability during COVID-19: an emerging economy perspective
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose Agriculture value chains (AVCs) have experienced unprecedented disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic, with lockdowns and stringent social distancing restrictions making buying and selling behaviours complex and uncertain. This study aims provide a theoretical framework describing the stakeholder behaviours that arise in severely disrupted value chains, which give rise to inter-organisational initiatives that impact industry sustainability. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-methods approach is adopted, in which uncertainty theory and relational governance theory and structured interviews with 15 AVC stakeholders underpin the initial conceptual model. The framework is empirically validated via partial least squares structural equation modelling using data from an online survey of 185 AVC stakeholders based in India. Findings The findings reveal that buyer and supplier uncertainty created by the COVID-19 lockdowns gives rise to behaviours that encourage stakeholders to engage in relational governance initiatives. Progressive farmers and other AVC stakeholders welcome this improved information sharing, which encourages self-reliance that positively impacts agricultural productivity and sustainability. Practical implications The new framework offers farmers and other stakeholders in developing nations possibilities to sustain their AVCs even in dire circumstances. In India, this also requires an enabling ecosystem to enhance smallholders' marketing power and help them take advantage of recent agricultural reforms. Originality/value Research is scarce into the impact of buyer and seller behaviour during extreme supply chain disruptions. This study applies relational governance and uncertainty theories, leading to a proposed risk aversion theory.

TI  - Examining forest economies: A case study of silk value chain analysis in Wajo District
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
AB  - Value chain analysis is a strategic analytical tool for understanding activities that represent the value of a product (or service), meanwhile providing opportunities for identifying competitive advantage. In this value chain analysis, the research aims to 1) map the actors of silk commodity business ventures, 2) determine the activities of these business actors, and 3) calculate and analyze financial ratios. This study was conducted in the Wajo District as a site historically well known for silk production, and which is undergoing efforts at revival. The method used in this study is observation, interview, and modeling. Data analysis was conducted as a classical value chain analysis, emphasizing the calculations of financial ratios. The results show that the main actors and activities in commodities trading are farmers, local traders, weavers, and silk clothing stores. The largest marketing margin is approximately IDR. 300,000, which is found in silk clothing stores. On the other hand, the smallest marketing margins amounted to about IDR. 100,000, which were identified among local traders. Finally, the largest profit margins were identified among farmers valued at IDR. 196,000, while the smallest profit margins were among local traders amounting to IDR. 68,000. Overall, this case study highlights that forest enterprises, in this case of the silk industry in Wajo, can improve household incomes for forest farmers, while maintaining their overall bargaining position against the market.

TI  - Timber Regulation and Value Chain in Community-Based Timber Enterprise and Smallholder Forestry in the Philippines
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Forest tenure reform has no doubt attained significant gains in promoting social justice and equity in the forest sector, through legal recognition of the communities' property rights over forest lands in many developing countries. This includes the right to harvest and market trees that the communities planted. Along these lines, the Philippines' community-based forest management (CBFM) and smallholder forestry have the potential to meet the country's wood demand and contribute to its poverty alleviation goal. Realities on the ground, however, make this lofty aspiration seems too far-fetched. Formal and informal barriers along the timber value chain restrict the growth and obstruct opportunities for community-based timber enterprises (CBTEs) and smallholder forestry. Using the case of CBFM and smallholder forestry in the Visayas and Mindanao Islands in the Philippines, respectively, this paper examines the hurdles posed by regulations and informal practices, such as restrictive policies and increased transaction costs, through a segment analysis of the timber value chain. It argues that failure to address these barriers would lead to the decline of CBTEs and smallholder enterprises, thus undermining the merits of the forest tenure reform.

TI  - Economic and environmental upgrading after a policy reform: The case of timber value chain in Myanmar
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Commitments to curb illegal logging and deforestation have proliferated in recent years with the increase of global trade in tropical timber and wood products. While they reflect international sustainability demands, the employed mechanisms to assure timber legality verification may not reflect conditions faced by local private sector actors. Facing rapid forest loss and limited foreign market access, government of Myanmar started reforming its forest policy to include a system of timber legality verification. Drawing on policy analysis and mixed-methods field research, we evaluate the feasibility of the policy reform to achieve economic and envi-ronmental upgrading in the timber value chain. Our findings question the transformative capacity of this policy reform. Not only that it failed to meet its sustainability goals, it has also created favourable conditions for a race to the bottom and concentration in the timber value chain. Economic and environmental upgrading take place at the expense of private smallholders who are expected to address a range of obstacles, including limited access to inputs, quality downgrading, and increased operational costs, which hamper their performance. To prevent socio-environmental losses, forest-sector regulatory reforms should be particularly mindful of these challenges in the midstream segment of the value chain.

TI  - Putting consumers first in food systems analysis: identifying interventions to improve diets in rural Ghana
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - A critical, yet underexplored, dimension of food systems is how consumer food preferences and beliefs interact with the food environment. We present a consumer-centered approach to identifying options for improving diets. The Value Chains for Nutrition (VCN) mixed-methods multi-disciplinary analytical approach was applied in rural Ghana. Data from in-depth consumer interviews, structured vendor interviews, and (secondary) household consumption surveys were analyzed to assess consumer diet patterns, related norms and preferences, and supply and demand characteristics of a set of empirically defined high-potential nutritious foods. Mapping results onto a supply-demand typology, we identify promising interventions to support increased availability, access, and affordability of these foods. Consumption data suggested that diets among Ghanaians were deficient in key micronutrients and calories. Fresh nutritious fruits and vegetables tended to be grown for home consumption rather than sale due to transportation challenges and seasonality of demand, especially near rural markets. Seasonal availability (fruits and vegetables) and affordability (animal foods) severely limited consumption of many nutritious foods. A set of supply, demand, and value chain interventions to enhance availability and affordability of nutritious foods are presented. Critical to success is to consider the set of interventions along each value chain required for impact.

TI  - Reconciling oil palm economic development and environmental conservation in Indonesia: A value chain dynamic approach
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Palm oil makes a significant contribution to the economies of Indonesia and Malaysia through private corporations, state-owned companies and smallholders, with the two countries supplying 85% of the global palm oil. Indonesia has 14 million hectares (ha) of oil palm; its palm oil exports were valued at USD 23 billion in 2017 and USD 21 billion in 2018. Both domestic and international communities, particularly the European Union (EU), have raised concerns about its sustainability and impact on forest conservation. For example, the European Parliament in 2017 issued a resolution to restrict the ability of EU countries to count palm oil-based biodiesel imports toward their renewable 2030 energy targets. This paper describes palm oil value chains in Indonesia at the national level, using value chain analysis and system dynamics modeling. The model is used to understand how the moratorium, peatland conservation, agrarian reform, and the EU biodiesel ban affect plantation expansion and production, employment, CO2 emissions, smallholder incomes, the private sector, and government. The model provides scenarios to make Indonesian palm oil more sustainable through intensification, no-deforestation, and no-peat strategies, as well as through land swapping. There are trade-offs between economic development and environmental conservation, but win-win solutions are available. Scenarios that build synergies between Indonesian palm oil development and forest conservation can help guide the new frontiers of oil palm development in Asia, South America, and Africa.

TI  - Livelihood strategies of cacao producers in Ecuador: Effects of national policies to support cacao farmers and specialty cacao landraces
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - This study identifies the livelihood strategies pursued by small cacao farmers in the Guayas coastal region in Ecuador, where two distinct cacao varieties are grown: the fine flavor variety, Cacao Nacional (CN), and a hybrid variety (CCN-51). Enhancing CN production is regarded as an economic development strategy since CN variety beans are characterized by premium prices in international markets. This study aims to assess the trade-offs faced by small cacao producers in the production of specialty (CN) vs. commodity (CCN-51) cacao and how they affect their livelihoods. A detailed household survey sampled 188 households. Based on activity variables, four latent profiles of livelihood strategies were identified, which were related to capital asset endowment and income share variables. The results show that there was not a clear gap between cultivation of CN and CCN-51, as 60% of the sampled households simultaneously grew both varieties. The results indicate that the variable "share of land allocated to CN" does not significantly contribute to discriminating among profiles. Households with a low share of land allocated to CCN-51 showed higher income diversification strategies and vice versa. Our study also shows that the lack of appropriate incentives may threaten the future cultivation of CN since the National policy for CN rehabilitation has had little impact on the more cacao-driven profiles that have a lower asset endowment. The design, structuring and maintenance of a domestic differentiated value chain for the CN variety, together with income diversification measures and prior improvement on the asset endowment of these profiles, seems to be the pathway to improve the livelihoods of small farmers and increase the success of the current policy for fine flavor cacao rehabilitation at the national level.

TI  - Women smallholder farmers' engagement in the vaccine chain in Sembabule District, Uganda: Barriers and Opportunities
T2  - DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE
AB  - This paper explores women smallholder livestock farmers' barriers to effective participation in the livestock vaccine value chain (LVVC) and strategies for optimising the use of vaccines against poultry (Newcastle disease), and goat diseases (Peste des Petits Ruminants) in Sembabule District, Uganda. Using the three domains of empowerment theory: intrinsic, instrumental, and collective agency combined with USAID's gender analysis framework, we found that limited control over resources, and inadequate gender responsive policies hinder women's participation. Self-help groups increased opportunity for livestock ownership, autonomy, and decision-making. Engagement of women in the LVVC, is an entry point for improved vaccine accessibility, and agency.

TI  - Determinants of non-technological upgrading strategies for rice market improvements in Uganda
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB  - A strategic shift incorporating global business perspective sets a new standpoint on how firms can gain entry into or upgrade networks that form value chains. Contemporary interventions and initiatives in value chain development are being geared towards nontechnological innovations and upgrading. This study was conducted to ascertain the determinants of non-technological upgrading strategies for rice market improvements. A cross sectional survey was carried out in northern Uganda on a sample of 442 rice farmers selected using multi-stage and random sampling techniques. Data were collected on rice actors using structured questionnaires while a binary logistic regression model was employed for analysis. The results indicated that factors such as location, household size, farm income, access to hired labor and market information, marketing on formal and informal contracts, individual marketing and marketing as a farmer group positively influenced horizontal, vertical and inter-chain upgrading strategies. However, experience and marital status of the actors affected all the three forms of upgrading negatively. Non-technological upgrading strategies were therefore, found to be key for competitiveness and emergence of other upgrading strategies (functional, product and process) in the rice value chain. Our results further, pointed to horizontal upgrading as a precursor for other strategies to emerge. Consequently, development agents working with geographically isolated smallholder farmers should start by promoting horizontal upgrading through training of farmers, organizing them into groups and later exploring other forms of upgrading strategies with the determinants under consideration.

TI  - A post-Marxist approach in development finance: PMF or production mutualisation fund model applied to agriculture
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - Development finance offers several solutions to support economic activity in poor areas usually based on a lending system. Such a perspective is mainly founded on the idea that the payment of a high interest rate by small farmers and small producers can compensate their non-sustainability or non-bankability. Instead of focusing on individual producers, sustainability which is a macro-concept would more likely be obtained at the level of the overall value chain. Agriculture's potential to develop rural areas depends on the scale of production and its impact on regional consumption and economy altogether. This article presents a way of improving these fundamental aspects through the development of a post-Marxist scheme transforming agriculture into a growth engine even for emerging countries. With this purpose, we introduce a new development model called PMF (Production Mutualisation Fund) whose aim is to mutualize the production and post-production chains and, therefore, extend the notion of bankability to the whole value chain. Such initiative suggests an alternative way of thinking development finance. It is no more about finding away to lend money to the non-sustainable smallholders\producers. It is about financing viable industrial service companies which will provide all necessary services to secure an optimized production, traceability and distribution of processed agricultural produce to end-distributors. This goes beyond the mere agricultural sphere and applies to many production sectors increasingly challenged by a forever accelerated deployment of new technologies: it combines the implementation of production services with infrastructure services (water management, logistics, power production and supply, etc.) to support a production economy using the producer's income as the key variable to optimize. In other words, such a model can contribute to the development of least to most industrialized economies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Effect of Value Chain Interventions for Staple Crops: Evidence from Small-Scale Farmers in Nicaragua
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - This paper quantitatively assesses the effect of value chain development projects on market linkages of small-scale farmers of a staple crop and agricultural income. We focus on Nicaraguan bean producers participating in a value chain development project. Using a panel data set, we apply difference-in-differences and instrumental variables estimators to identify causal effects of programme participation. We first quantify the positive direct effect of training on bean sales in terms of quantity and percentage of beans sold in linked markets. Second, we show that intensified commercialisation contributes to total agricultural income, suggesting a positive indirect effect of the intervention. Our results indicate that market linkage of smallholder farmers requires different sets of intervention tools than farm technical assistance.

TI  - Outgrower schemes and sugar value-chains in Zambia: Rethinking determinants of rural inclusion and exclusion
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Integration of smallholders in outgrower schemes has been advanced as a strategy for poverty reduction in the global south, but how terms and conditions of inclusion and exclusion shape divergent outcomes, and processes underpinning these local dynamics remain an under-researched area. This study, set in Zambia's southern 'sugarbelt' region of Mazabuka, draws on two contrasting outgrower schemes to examine determinants of smallholder inclusion in sugar value-chains, and consider how various terms and conditions underpining inclusion shape various interests, reactions and pathways for value capture among different local groups. Our study reaveals terms and conditions are important in shaping divergent outcomes for smallholders included in sugar value-chains. It shows determinants of inclusion and exclusion are complex and go beyond market imperatives that are production related (structural) to include social-cultural dynamics (non-structural). The centrality of the paper points to lived realities and experiences for different groups and political reactions from below, underlining how socially contested intersection of global-local value-chain produces diverse but interdependent hierarchies of inclusion and exclusion. For an early stage in planning of outgrower schemes by state and non-state actors, recognition of the various social groups and their complex engagement and reactions to changes in land-use and land control will not only expose competing interests but should inform polices, institutions and investments to improve value-chain impacts. This paper hopes to contribute towards a more nuanced understanding of the complex engagement of smallholders in changes in land use and land control in developing countries in the era of land-grabbing.

TI  - In All Shapes and Colors: Varieties of Contract Farming
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES AND POLICY
AB  - Contract fanning, wherein a processor contracts out the production of an agricultural commodity to a grower, is the first step toward more vertically coordinated - and thus more modern - agricultural value chains. As such, in principle contract farming is a necessary condition for the structural transformation of developing economies to occur. Yet contract farming is far from monolithic, and the institution takes on a variety of forms. In this article, we describe how the institution of contract farming varies in cross-sectional data covering 1,200 households across six regions of Madagascar, half of which are growers in contract farming agreements covering a dozen different crops. In this setting, participation in contract fanning has been associated with increases in income, improvements in food security, and reductions in income variability. Given those presumed effects in this setting of participation in contract farming, we then look at the correlates in our data of participation in contract farming. as well as one's willingness to pay to participate in contract fanning as a grower in an attempt to better target policies aimed at encouraging participation in contract farming.

TI  - Small Farms Survival and Growth: Making Investments Despite Credit Constraints
T2  - SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
AB  - This article argues that we know little about how small farmers in post-communist Europe survive and even grow while having little access to credit markets. In approaching small farmers, this paper builds on ideas of self-provisioning, contending that the tendency among small farmers is not one of growth towards and through economies of scale, but one of internalising and de-monetising costs, by growing in order to control upstream and downstream links in the value chain. It asks what is it that makes self-provisioning possible in two post-communist regions (located in Romania and Ukraine) and identifies various assets in the smallholders' environments, such as most importantly a diverse scene of intermediaries supplying smallholders with cash incomes. The implication of the research is that the existence of these assets is crucial for the smallholders' survival and growth, and these assets should be valued accordingly rather than dismissed in favour of integrating smallholders into modern, retailer-dominated, value chains.

TI  - Maize value chain analysis: A case of smallholder maize production and marketing in selected areas of Malawi and Mozambique
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - This article analyzes maize value chain performance in Malawi and Mozambique using data collected from a market study commissioned by the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture. The results show that although smallholder maize productivity is slightly higher in Malawi, a maize value chain analysis indicates that smallholder maize in Mozambique is more competitive. Mozambique has a relatively higher competitive advantage with regard to maize production because of the relatively lower input costs, perhaps due to its proximity to the coast, which invariably reduces input costs relative to its land-locked neighbor, Malawi. However, smallholder maize productivity is low in both countries, when compared to the regional average. The article concludes that interventions aimed at raising smallholder productivity would invariably make smallholder farmers more competitive. It proposes policy implications aimed at raising the productivity and trade competitiveness of maize, as this will ensure the overall productivity of the maize-based smallholder farming system in the two countries.

TI  - Motivation and barriers to access to formal credit of primary cinnamon producers from the perspective of value chain development in Northwestern Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate borrowing motivation, credit access barriers and their impacts on income of smallholder farmers engaging in cinnamon value chain development in Northwestern Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach A multistage sampling technique using a structural questionnaire and in-depth interviews was applied for collecting primary data from farmers and relevant stakeholders. The Propensity Score Matching was employed to analyze access barriers and examine whether relaxing these barriers can improve farmer income. To deal with the issue of model uncertainty and further increase the robustness of results, Bayesian model average and the bootstrapping approach were applied. Findings To fulfill the certain quality standards of cinnamon products which are later used in the medicinal and food industry, farmers as primary producers need credit for intensive investment to increase the value of their products. Still, there are 25.36 percent of farmers who have access constraints to formal credit. In the credit received group, 24.56 percent have not received full credit as demanded. Access problems are relevant to lack of collateral, lack of bank account holdings, inconvenient access to roads, weak chain linkage and limited organic farming. Removing credit access barriers can improve the income for farmers from cinnamon farming activities.
   Originality/value Empirical studies on agricultural credit from the perspective of value chain development remain scarce. A better understanding of credit access constraints allows for the positing of recommendations for policy makers to facilitate value chain lending and a medicinal plant-based agro-forestry system in similar situations.

TI  - Marketing native crops to improve rural Andean livelihoods
T2  - REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE LA PAPA
AB  - Native potato production is an important livelihood strategy for most rural Andean families. An inclusive value chain development approach developed by the International Potato Center (CIP) triggered innovation processes to enhance the marketing of native potatoes benefiting small-scale producers and value chain actors and improving their livelihoods. Making use of new market opportunities for development requires an array of other innovations including institutional and technological ones. The approach initially developed in Peru was also successfully implemented in Ecuador and Bolivia and could be expanded to other crops in other regions.

TI  - Triangle of Linkages among Modernising Markets, Sprayer-traders, and Mango-farming Intensification in Indonesia
T2  - BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - The domestic mango value chain in Indonesia is transforming rapidly. This article examines the triangle of linkages among farmers' participation in modernising markets, the emerging use of outsourced services by sprayer-traders (STs), and farm technology intensification. The key findings are as follows. First, small farmersnot just larger farmersparticipate in modernising markets. However, the participation is by the upper tier of small farmers, defined in non-land asset terms. Second, although both small and larger farmers use STs, the strongest determinant of use of an ST is the interaction between having non-farm employment (thus, demand for substitution for own labour on the farm) and having a medium-sized commercial farm (thus, demand for skilled agronomic services). Farmers in mango cluster areas also tend to use STs. Finally, use of STs and participation in modernising markets spur farming intensification through the use of modern inputs.

TI  - Potential of traditional Chilean blood-fleshed peach to support livelihood opportunities in local agriculture
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - The blood-flesh peach or vineyard peach is an older heritage cultivar with juicy red-flesh and tart-sweet flavor. They are popular in France, where more than 200 years ago wine growers used to plant them on the vineyards as biological markers to detect the presence of powdery mildew. It is present in countries such as China, Italy, New Zealand, Australia and USA however, it remains a very rare variety worldwide. In Chile, the blood-flesh peach has a centenary presence in rural orchards where is called "Durazno Betarraga." Reproduced by seeds, it has pass through generations of family farmers and has been adapted to local environmental conditions. This red-flesh peach is a local variety considered part of their traditional diets, however, cultural changes in food consumption, short postharvest life and water scarcity due to climate change are threatening its conservation. One of the objectives of the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables, as defined by the FAO, is to integrate small holders and family farmers into value chains for sustainable production and consumption of fruits and vegetables recognizing the contributions of farmer's landraces to their food security, nutrition, livelihoods and income. To promote this objective, we present the work we have been carry out for several years with a farming community. We have conducted ethnographic research to provide a qualitative description of the agricultural value of the blood peach in a limited territory of the Maule Region defined as the study area. For the quantitative section of our research we analyzed the antioxidant capacity (ORAC) and total polyphenol content and compared them with those of other fruits. To gather information on the presence of the blood-fleshed peach in other regions of Chile, we used a citizen science approach through social networks. We propose that this local variety is an innovative raw material to develop healthy fruit-based food, thus encouraging its conservation and consumption with a positive social and economic impact for the community and the local food system.

TI  - The Institutional Environment of the Palm Oil Value Chain and Its Impact on Community Development in Kapuas Hulu, Indonesia
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN STUDIES
AB  - The aim of this study is to present the multi-scalar institutional environment that has emerged around the palm oil value chain, and to analyze how this influences community development outcomes in the Kapuas Hulu district of West Kalimantan. A common narrative presented by many environmental organizations, and indeed often reinforced in the academic literature, is one where local communities actively resist the expansion of oil palm plantations but are ultimately powerless to halt it. This narrative tends to depend on, and reinforces, a portrait of traditional communities as being dependent on subsistence food provisioning and natural resources for their livelihoods, thus making them particularly sensitive to the widespread environmental changes caused by this highly transformative-in a landscape sense-type of commercial agriculture. This research draws upon mixed method data collection techniques, including eight months of participant observation fieldwork across three villages in 2016 and 2017, group discussions, household surveys, and semi-structured interviews. Conceptually, we develop an understanding of the institutional environment as applied within global value chain theory, which we present as a complex amalgam of social structures from within the value chain (especially governance by lead firms), those external to it (including formal state institutions and NGOs), and the changing customary institutions within production landscapes. The ability of local communities to participate in the construction of this broader institutional environment, and to benefit from it, is of critical importance when assessing the impact of incorporation within the palm oil economy. This study thus helps present a more nuanced analysis of community engagement with palm oil and the processes driving contemporary agrarian change.

TI  - A study on the agricultural value chain financing in India
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-ZEMEDELSKA EKONOMIKA
AB  - Agriculture in developing countries is experiencing profound, fast-moving changes. Globalization, although advancing more rapidly in some countries than others, has hastened the transition from the traditional, low-productivity agriculture toward a modern, high-productivity agricultural sector. The resulting processes of structural change are having profound consequences for employment, the methods of generating income, risk management, poverty alleviation, and the wellbeing in rural households in these countries. This study describes the approaches for the organised value chains as a new business model in a globalized world and it describes about the great variety of financial arrangements found in India and the actors in the agri-food chain with varying degrees of formality and informality. The study also brings about the role of the value chain in promoting the rural financing deepening, the financial operators that use agricultural value chain to provide dynamic, innovative services with low cost transaction costs and the technical assistance programs to help the participants in the chain to upgrade their operations, to reduce risk and to improve the access to financial services and concludes by identifying the changes in paradigm.

TI  - An Analysis of the Tax Incidence of VAT to Milk in Malawi
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Dairy is a key investment sector for the Government of Malawi. On 1 October 2016, the Malawi Revenue Authority announced that milk, which until then had been exempted from value added tax (VAT), was going to be taxed at the standard rate of 16.5 percent. The measure has been met with strong opposition and thus, was short lived (eliminated in May 2017). The purpose of this paper is to present an analysis of the effect that such a tax would have on its incidence, on the different stages of the supply chain, and ultimately on its economic and social sustainability. The paper investigates these implications by developing a multimarket model applied to the Malawian dairy supply chain. The results indicate that 24.3 percent of the VAT revenues would be borne by consumers and the remaining 75.7 percent would be borne by the domestic dairy industry (i.e., processors and smallholder farmers). This was due mainly to the value of the price elasticity of consumers' demand for pasteurised milk. The results highlight the vulnerability of inclusive value chains to economic policies that may affect consumers' demand.

TI  - Women's empowerment in traditional food value chains at the micro-level: Evidence from cassava smallholder farming in Tanzania
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Empowering women improves household food productivity and security. We examined women's empowerment within the cassava value chain according to the five domains of empowerment of the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index, using data from 228 respondents in Tanzania. Disempowerment indices for women and men were 0.95 and 0.14, respectively. Women were disempowered in the production, leadership, and time domains. Women were empowered in the resources domain, which entailed joint ownership and decision making. Marital status and educational levels were significantly associated with women's empowerment. Policies to improve women's empowerment should focus on securing ownership of resources and access to credit.

TI  - Transforming the Lives of Mountain Women Through the Himalayan Nettle Value Chain: A Case Study From Darchula, Far West Nepal
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Naugad is a remote rural municipality in the mountains of far west Nepal with poor accessibility and limited economic opportunities, especially for women and marginalized communities. Promotion of the natural resource-based value chain for allo (the Himalayan nettle, Girardinia diversifolia) was identified as an innovative livelihood strategy by the local community. Value chain development started in 2014. The project was designed to focus on women and include participation by the private sector. This paper analyzes the impact of the project, especially on women's lives, using primary and secondary data. A community-owned enterprise was established with private-sector support from the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation's Business Association of Home Based Workers (SABAH) Nepal. The enterprise now has 82 members (69 of them women), with 150 households benefiting directly and indirectly. SABAH Nepal provided training in sustainable harvesting and processing techniques and promotes the products in high-end international markets. A buyback guarantee scheme provides security to local artisans. The quality and range of allo products have increased markedly, as has the share in benefits for local people. Skills training and visits to trade fairs have helped women build their capacity and take a leading role in the value chain process. The communityowned enterprise members have earned up to NPR 4000 per month from sewing, more than the local rate for day labor and sufficient to cover general household expenses. More than 25 women entrepreneurs have started microbusinesses related to allo. Allo has become an important economic asset, transforming the lives of mountain women in this village area. The approach has potential for scaling up across the subtropical to temperate areas of the Himalayan region in Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, and Nepal.

TI  - First report of calonectria pseudoreteaudii in Lao PDR associated with a leaf spot disease of macadamia integrifolia
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB  - Macadamia (Proteaceae) is a rainforest genus indigenous to Queensland and northern New South Wales, Australia. It includes four species, two of which, and their hybrids, are grown commercially for their high-value nuts in Australia and other countries. Macadamia is now being grown in several orchards and in gardens on the Bolaven plateau in southern Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). In November 2018, leaf spot disease symptoms were observed on young leaves of macadamia trees in a demonstration garden 15 km west of Paksong, on the Bolaven Plateau in Champasak Province, Lao PDR. A fungus isolated from the leaf spots was identified by morphological and DNA sequence comparisons as Calonectria pseudoreteaudii. This is the first report of this species in the Lao PDR. This report is one of a continuing series of first reports of crop pathogens in the southern region of the Lao PDR. These are outcomes of a continuing cooperative program in diagnostics, integrated disease management (IDM) and biosecurity, involving staff of the Champasak Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Office (PAFO) and plant pathologists in Australia, New Zealand, and Italy. The program has been supported by the Crawford Fund of Australia since 2009 in cooperation with state and federal government agencies. Short-term and long-term volunteer plant pathologists are sponsored primarily by the Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) through the Australian Volunteers Program, and the Crawford Fund. The diagnostic studies undertaken during the program are designed to support the professional development of Laos provincial and district staff and provide a basis for developing IDM strategies for extension to small-holder farmers. Central to these studies are regular surveys of established and novel vegetable, field, and fruit crops, and collection of diseased specimens. It is important to monitor novel crops early in their evaluation in the local agro-ecosystems; failure to recognise the potential impact of disease on novel crops can lead to serious financial losses for small-holder farmers, who are usually resource poor. All culturable pathogens are deposited in the International Collection of Microorganisms from Plants (ICMP) in New Zealand. Dried herbarium specimens are deposited in the Plant Pathology and Mycology Herbarium (DAR) of the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI) in Australia. The formal publication of first reports creates a knowledge legacy as well as valuable teaching aids in training programs. Australia and other countries also benefit from such cooperative diagnostic studies; they provide early warning of emerging pathogens as well as providing specimens for use in refining existing detection protocols for exotic pathogens.

T2  - RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Cattle manure value chains play important biological and economic roles in smallholder crop-livestock systems in developing countries, but relative to other livestock products our understanding of the nature and impact of manure sales is limited. In regions with an active manure trade, farmers face a choice between manure use on-farm and sales, which affects nutrient flows and participant incomes. We analyzed the manure value chain operating in south-central Vietnam as an example of the function and role of manure trade in crop-livestock systems. Lowland cattle farmers sell manure through a network of chain participants, including small-scale collectors, lowland and highland traders, to pepper, coffee, dragon fruit and rubber farms in the central highlands and southeast coast. We collected and summarized quantitative data (e.g., manure-related labor, manure transactions, and fertilizer and manure use) gathered in semi-structured interviews with value-chain participants [lowland cattle owners (n=101), traders (n=27) and end users (n=72)]. Lowland cattle owners were selected by stratified random sampling, and subsequent participants were identified in preceding interviews. One key finding concerns the seasonality of the manure value chain: most manure flowed between February and August (lowland dry season and period of peak highland demand) from lowland communes to highland coffee and pepper farms for use as organic soil amendments. Fewer sales occurred, at a lower price, to southeast coastal dragon fruit farms and rubber companies. Value addition to manure occurred via drying, bagging, collection, transport and composting. The presence of local traders facilitated market sales for smallholder cattle owners, and prices through the value chain generally reflected costs for value addition. The geographic distribution of cattle relative to agricultural land influenced the flow of manure, with net outflows from regions with higher animal density to regions with lower density and higher value crop production. Manure trade was an important source of supplementary income for farmers and a primary livelihood activity for traders. Value chain participant net incomes ranged from near US$100yr(-1) for lowland farmers to over US$13,000yr(-1) for traders, and returns to labor were just over US$0.50h(-1) for lowland farmers and US$2h(-1) for traders. The quantitative information generated during our descriptive assessment provides an important first step toward manure value chain improvement, indicates survey methods that can be applied in other areas, and identifies next steps necessary to evaluate chain evolution and resilience.

TI  - Territory and trade networks in the small-scale oil-palm industry in rural Ghana
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - The Global Value Chain approach and related 'chain approaches' within economic geography have proved to be important frameworks for conducting empirical studies of agricultural economies and their implications for smallholders and rural communities. Such studies have their strengths in explaining how global dynamics impact on local communities, but they are relatively weak in explaining commercial configurations at the local level. This paper examines the differences in the structure of trade networks between actors in the small-scale oil-palm industry in four neighbouring settlements in rural Ghana. The exploratory application of social network analysis (SNA) is used to uncover the complexity of the networks in the trade in products and services in the local small-scale palm-oil sector, which exist parallel to a more formal large-scale sector. As a result, distinct local patterns of economic organisation are identified, indicating that SNA is a valuable tool for uncovering the territorial complexities of economic networks that other research methodologies may fail to capture. Hence, SNA is also an important and novel methodology for policy-making aimed at supporting and regulating an increasingly commercial agricultural economy in rural Africa.

TI  - Determinants of contract farming in barley production - Regression tree approach
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB  - Barley, a nutri-rich cereal is gaining momentum among stakeholders owing to multiple health benefits but the concern is its declining area, possibly attributed to lack of market and competitive pricing strategy. Amongst alternatives, contract farming is widely suggested for better price realisation and assured market. In the context, the present study was carried out during 2013-15 in four major barley growing states in India, viz. Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh for identifying the determinants of contract farming from a sample of 400 randomly selected farmers using regression tree approach. Findings indicated that the average yield of farmers enrolled in contract farming was 4791 kg/ha (n=90) against non-contractors with an estimated yield of 3549 kg/ha (n=310), implying a yield advantage of 35%. The practice of enrollment into contracts was popular in Rajasthan as corroborated by regression tree. The analysis also indicated that farm size, seed replacement behaviour, source of seed and area under barley were turned as deciding factors in contract enrollment. Overall, the study indicated that region plays a prominent role in enrollment into contracts despite multiple benefits availed. The study advocates barley growers to take advantage of contract farming, especially small-holders to enroll into contracts for mitigating price risk apart from self-empowerment in barley production.

TI  - Practices associated with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza spread in traditional poultry marketing chains: Social and economic perspectives
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - In developing countries, smallholder poultry production contributes to food security and poverty alleviation in rural areas. However, traditional poultry marketing chains have been threatened by the epidemics caused by the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1) virus.
   The article presents a value chain analysis conducted on the traditional poultry marketing chain in the rural province of Phitsanulok, Thailand. The analysis is based on quantitative data collected on 470 backyard chicken farms, and on qualitative data collected on 28 poultry collectors, slaughterhouses and market retailers, using semi-structured interviews. The article examines the organization of poultry marketing chains in time and space, and shows how this may contribute to the spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 in the small-scale poultry sector. The article also discusses the practices and strategies developed by value chain actors facing poultry mortality, with their economic and social determinants. More broadly, this study also illustrates how value chain analysis can contribute to a better understanding of the complex mechanisms associated with the spread of epidemics in rural communities.

TI  - Analysis of cassava value chain in Nigeria: pro-poor approach and gender perspective
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VALUE CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB  - In Nigeria, cassava has moved from a little yielding deprivation standby crop to a great bouncy money yielding products with its many other usages for livestock feeds, food and agro-industry raw materials. This study examines chain processes of cassava processes and identifies value along the chain with gendered perspective. The study was conducted in Southwest, Nigeria and choice was done systematically to select 250 cassava growers. Data were analysed by means of factor analysis and Poisson model. Results showed that most cassava male growers traded cassava in garden-fresh form exclusive of value, while female growers transformed cassava from its garden-fresh form and thus adding value along the chain for income increase. Female cassava farmers recognise that there are markets when cassava is transformed from its garden-fresh form. Consequently, it is essential to encourage suitable processing technologies for cassava products and effective contact to marketing information. Women need to be motivated to effectively use these resources. The study discovered that the advantages of women's partaking in agricultural value chains are defined by their power over valuable resources and their strength in household level rulings. This strategy could be a means to pro-poor gendered route out of poverty in many Nigerian homes.

TI  - Upgrading Bay Leaf Farmers in Value Chains-Strategies for Improving Livelihoods and Poverty Reduction from Udayapur District of Nepal
T2  - SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
AB  - This article highlights the results of an action research to upgrade mountain farmers of bay leaf (Cinnamomum tamala Nees and Eberm) in Udayapur district of Nepal. Farmers received low prices, lacked market information, capacities, and institutional mechanisms, and were exploited by traders. To address these constraints, three independent but interlinked pro-poor value chain (VC) upgrading strategies comprising VC coordination upgrading and horizontal and vertical contractualization were implemented. Information was collected from focus-group discussions with collectors, traders, and facilitators, and a questionnaire was used to collect pre- and postintervention data (n = 120). VC upgrading strategies improved harvesting practices, increased farmers' bargaining power, and led to a threefold increase in price, which increased household incomes. Results demonstrated improved terms of participation of farmers and a general increase in market price of bay leaf in Udayapur. The study approach can be up scaled to reduce poverty from high value products.

TI  - Exploring gender dynamics, economics and perceptions of the vulnerability of the bush mango value chain in three provinces of Gabon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - This study conducted around three provinces of Gabon (Estuaire, Ngounie, and Nyanga) aims at exploring gender dynamics, economics, and vulnerability perceptions in the bush mango value chain by analyzing male-female roles and relationships. Interviews were randomly conducted with 174 actors as follows: 132 (Estuaire), 12 (Ngounie), and 30 (Nyanga) provinces using a semi-structured questionnaire and field observations. Women headed households dominate harvesting (21.8%), processing/trading (10.3%) and trading stages (55.2%) compared to men harvesting (7.5%), processing/trading (0.6%) and trading (4.6%). Women tend to generate relatively higher annual gross average income (1.4 million FCFA per annum), which is 1.7 times higher than that of men. Poor management of resources, the lack of harvesting norms, logging-driven deforestation, and slash-and-burn agriculture are among the perceived factors threatening the value chain. Targeted policy and actions on a gender perspective are suggested to reduce income inequality between men and women along the value chain. A long-term ecological study to monitor changes over forest resources use is crucial before carrying out any mitigating measures based on cultivation and domestication in the study areas.

TI  - Smallholder Participation in Contract Farming: Comparative Evidence from Five Countries
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Supermarkets, specialized wholesalers, processors, and agro-exporters are transforming the marketing channels into which smallholder farmers sell produce in low-income economies. We develop a conceptual framework with which to study contracting between smallholders and a commodity-processing firm. We then synthesize results from empirical studies of contract farming arrangements in five countries (Ghana, India, Madagascar, Mozambique, and Nicaragua). The resulting meta-narrative documents patterns of participation, the welfare gains associated with participation, reasons for nonparticipation, the significant extent of contract noncompliance, and the considerable dynamism of these value chains as farmers and firms enter and exit frequently.

TI  - The Effects of Risk and Shocks on Non-Farm Enterprise Development in Rural Ethiopia
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This paper assesses the impact of risk and shocks on non-farm enterprise development in rural Ethiopia using a matched household-enterprise-community dataset augmented with precipitation based measures of risk. The likelihood of running a non-farm firm and the returns to running such firms co-vary with agricultural productivity shocks. Diversification into non-farm activities thus provides limited protection against fluctuations in agricultural performance. This may explain why ex-ante risk has no impact on the likelihood of running a non-farm firm. It nonetheless hampers non-farm enterprise development by repressing investment and inducing sorting into less capital-intensive activities. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - ADVANCING SMALLHOLDERS' SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOOD THROUGH LINKAGES AMONG STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CASSAVA (MANIHOT ESCULENTA CRANTZ) VALUE CHAIN: THE CASE OF DAK LAK PROVINCE, VIETNAM
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a versatile crop that plays a vital role in sustaining smallholders' livelihoods, and in increasing farmers' income. This research assessed the cassava value chain in Dak Lak province, Vietnam It demonstrated the need for enhanced efficiency in the production of cassava thus enhancing the cassava value chain Value chain analysis was conducted through a questionnaire-based survey of 300 household farmers, in-depth interviews with key informants, and focus group discussions in seven communes in three districts. The aim was to explore how to improve and develop the value chain, increase stakeholders' incomes and particularly, to ensure sustainable household livelihoods. The findings relating to the sharing of value added among the stakeholders showed that farmers create the highest value added but that intermediaries derive the most profit. In addition, relationships exist amongst different stakeholder ranging from input providers to the final users which are overwhelmingly starch and ethanol factories. There is a local linkage between input suppliers and farmers, both spot-market and persistent relationships which exist between farmers and intermediaries. Furthermore, the distribution of both gross and net profits overwhelmingly favors the traders and processors. However, intermediaries play an important role and the farmers would not secure full benefits without their support.

TI  - An approach to measuring food losses in the potato chain in Ecuador and Peru
T2  - REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE LA PAPA
AB  - Potato production and the related commercial and technological characteristics in the potato value chain, is one of the most important sources of income and food security of thousands of small-scale farmers in the Andes, who are increasingly challenged by trends of urbanization, volatility of agricultural prices, water and land scarcity, environmental stress, and weather shocks. Understanding food losses along the potato value chain and what role these losses play in food security has recently caught the interest of researchers and policy makers as reducing food losses can improve food availability without increasing agricultural inputs, use of land, or technological improvements on the production side. However, estimating food losses has proven to be a daunting task and efforts have yielded estimates that vary considerably. The methodology presented in this study distinguishes losses that are due to physical quantities from those due to quality and value. The results show that the most important losses occur in the production link and that the most important losses faced by small-scale potato producers occur due to crop management practices (before harvest), pests and diseases, frost and drought. Losses in production amount to an average of 95% of total losses in the value chain. This paper reports on the study conducted by the International Potato Center (CIP) through the CGIAR Program on Policy, Institution and Markets (PIM) lead by IFPRI, to evaluate the extent and sources of food losses taking as case study key potato value chains in Ecuador and Peru.

TI  - Trade patterns facilitating highly pathogenic avian influenza virus dissemination in the free-grazing layer duck system in Vietnam
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses continue to threaten smallholder poultry producers in several South-east Asian countries, including Vietnam. In particular, the free-grazing duck system has been repeatedly highlighted as a major risk factor for HPAI outbreaks. Free-grazing ducks, which scavenge on rice paddies after the harvest, account for a large proportion of the duck population in Vietnam and the wider South-east Asian region. However, the structure and dynamics of the free-grazing duck production from farm to consumption has not been described for Vietnam. In this study, we used a value chain approach to provide a complete picture of the actors involved in the production and marketing of free-grazing duck eggs and spent layer ducks, as well as to investigate the governance structure of this food system. Group interviews and key informant interviews were conducted in two provinces located in the Mekong River Delta (MRD) and the Red River Delta (RRD). The results presented here highlight similarities and differences in farming and trade practices between the two provinces. The trade of spent layer ducks involved large volumes of live ducks being sent to China and Cambodia for consumption, generating a substantial risk of transboundary spread of pathogens, including HPAI viruses. We describe the major role of duck yards, which act as hubs in the northbound trade of spent layer ducks. These yards should be considered as essential links in the value chain of spent layer ducks when considering HPAI surveillance and control. The veterinary authorities are only marginally involved in the value chain activities, and their influence could be strengthened by increasing surveillance activities for instance in duck yards. Last, we discuss the dynamics of the duck value chain and further implications for future HPAI management policies.

TI  - Price Analysis of Export Behavior of Aquaculture Producers in Honduras and Peru
T2  - AQUACULTURE ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Many small-scale aquaculture producers in developing countries find it challenging to access international value chains due to barriers-to-entry. To shed light on this issue, this article presents three case studies where we analyze export behavior of aquaculture producers from Honduras and Peru based on price behavior in export markets (EU and USA) and in domestic wholesale markets. The price analysis suggests that in all three value chains that include shrimp, tilapia and trout there are competitive aquaculture producers that participate in international value chains and that are able to respond to profitable opportunities when relative prices change. While some small scale producers are able to enter international chains through larger exporters, the majority seem to serve domestic markets and often markets close to the production sites.

TI  - Tomato seed value chain analysis and seed conditioning among seed companies in Uganda
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Tomatoes increase nutritional food security and income among Ugandan smallholder farmers who have limited access to high quality seed. The objective of this study was to analyze the current tomato seed value chain for Uganda. Survey responses determined roles of key participants, including Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) for regulation and certification; National Agricultural Research Organization for breeding cultivars and seed multiplication; Makerere University for education and research; commercial seed companies for seed importation and conditioning; seed distributors for sales; and smallholder farmers as savers and end users of seed. Challenges included an inefficient domestic seed distribution system, technical constraints in seed production and conditioning by seed companies, inadequate networks and communication among the seed industry's key participants, and partial regulation of the seed industry. Seed companies played a key role in seed conditioning processes. Companies imported all tomato seeds into Uganda and stated germination as their primary goal for quality. Challenges for seed companies included assistance from MAAIF to regulate and certify seed and access to improved technologies. Attaining high quality seed by commercial Uganda-parent companies will require additional investment and training of seed technologists for domestic testing and seed quality assurance.

TI  - Scenario-based actions to upgrade small-scale furniture producers and their impacts on women in Central Java, Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - Indonesian furniture accounts for almost 1% of the global furniture trade, valued at more than USD 135 billion. In many countries, including Japan, European countries and Indonesia, women make decisions about selecting which furniture to buy. In Central Java's Jepara District - the centre of teak furniture production in Indonesia - annual furniture exports are valued at USD 120 million. However, the roles of small-scale producers and women workers in furniture industry are weak. Though women workers play an important role in generating revenue, they are paid less than men. They are also less powerful and exercise less control over resources, decision making, product development and bargaining. Action research and value chain analysis were used to improve small-scale producers and women workers. This paper explores different scenarios for upgrading small-scale producers, such as participation in trade exhibitions, training programmes and producer associations and their effects on women workers.

TI  - Youth agripreneurship in the horticultural value-chain: The case of small-scale mango farmers in Southern Ghana
T2  - AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
AB  - Development partners are promoting youth entrepreneurship in agriculture (agripreneurship) in sub-Saharan Africa. While youth engagement in food crop production and marketing has received a lot of attention on both policy and academic fronts, the low level of involvement of youth in the horticultural value-chain has received little attention. To this end, this study assessed the factors that influence participation of youth in the horticultural value-chain. Using the multistage sampling technique, data were collected from 224 mango-producing households in southern Ghana. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the binary logit model. The study found that there exist differences between the youth and older farmers in terms of socioeconomic factors including education, household size, and income, and institutional support services including certification, credit, extension services and group membership. The results of the econometric model revealed that age, education, and access to credit and extension services motivate youth participation in agriculture. Access to credit and ownership of motorized transport encouraged participation of older farmers in high value markets. The study recommends that development partners provide credit facilities and capacity development through agricultural training and extension services to enhance youth participation in high value markets.

TI  - Participation in and Gains from Traditional Vegetable Value Chains: a Gendered Analysis of Perceptions of Labour, Income and Expenditure in Producers' and Traders' Households
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Horticulture is one of the fastest growing subsectors of agriculture in Tanzania. Gender relations in vegetable-producing and vegetable-trading households need to be understood to make value chain development equitable. This study, carried out in northern and central Tanzania, is based on data from surveys, focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews. The perceptions of men and women traders and producers are investigated with regard to labour participation in traditional vegetable value chains and gains (income and expenditure) from it. Farmers were found to report more balanced intra-household labour arrangements paired with less-balanced income and expenditure shares, while traders indicated less-balanced labour contributions that went hand in hand with more-balanced shares of benefits. Farmers related limited household development not only to imbalances in benefits but also to a lack of trust and cooperation between spouses. The importance of gender-transformative approaches in agricultural value chains is emphasized herein.

TI  - The Determinants of Accessibility of Financial Services in Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The study aims to assess the impact of factors on the access to financial services by Vietnamese farmers. The number of respondents in this study is 402 household heads participating in six diverse agricultural value chains in Vietnam. The explanatory variables of the Multinomial Logit model estimates variables at the individual characteristics while the Mixed Logit model can combine the two types of variables together to estimate the effects simultaneously. On the other hand, the Ordinal Logit model is used to evaluate the determinants of the increase in the quantity of financial services used by individuals. The estimation results show that male-headed households have more access to financial services than females. Younger farmers are more likely to use formal financial services than the elderly. Financial literacy, land ownership, and shocks in agricultural production all have a positive impact on the probability of dealing with banks. In addition, the degree of linkage and credibility of the value chain have a significant positive impact on the accessibility of financial services to farmers. The findings of this study suggest that limiting gender inequality, focusing on youth marketing and developing agricultural value chains will have a positive impact on farmers' access to financial services.

TI  - Improving the efficiency of domestic vegetable marketing systems in East Africa Constraints and opportunities
T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - The majority of smallholders growing vegetables in East Africa market their produce domestically. It is an important source of income for many poor smallholder households and those involved in vegetable value chains. This paper highlights the major constraints of and identifies potential opportunities for improving the efficiency of domestic vegetable marketing systems in two countries Kenya and Tanzania. Emphasis is given to tomato and onion as commonly marketed and consumed vegetables throughout the region. The authors also look at indigenous vegetables marketed domestically. Finally, they consider the importance of the export vegetable subsector as a role model for improving the efficiency, growth and economic value of domestic vegetable marketing systems in East Africa. This analysis should guide policy makers towards key interventions to facilitate the development of efficient vegetable marketing systems, contributing to poverty reduction and fostering economic growth in East Africa.

TI  - Dynamics of the Fertilizer Value Chain in Mozambique
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Mozambique is characterized by low agricultural productivity, which is associated with low use of yield-enhancing agricultural inputs. Fertilizer application rate averaged 5.7 kg ha(-1) in Mozambique during the period 2006 to 2015, considerably low by regional targets, yet constraints that affect fertilizer use have not been thoroughly investigated. This study examined the constraints on fertilizer value chains in Mozambique to contribute to fertilizer supply chain strengthening. We used a combination of multivariate analysis and descriptive methods. Our findings indicate that fertilizer use has both demand and supply constraints. Key demand-side constraints include liquidity challenges, limited awareness about the benefits of using fertilizer, and low market participation, while the main supply-side constraints include high transaction costs, limited access to finance, and lack of soil testing results and corresponding fertilizer recommendations by soil type and crop uptake. These results suggest that scaling up the input subsidy program through vouchers (either paper-based vouchers or e-vouchers) with demonstration plots and effective targeting could drive up smallholders' demand for fertilizer and fertilizer supply by strengthening a sustainable network of wholesalers and retailers. This would likely boost agricultural productivity.

TI  - Avocado Production and Local Trade in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania: A Case of an Emerging Trade Commodity from Horticulture
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Avocado crop in Tanzania is sparingly investigated regardless of being an important fruit commodity. This study was undertaken to explore the yield and the value chain of this crop in the country. Data were collected mainly by face-to-face interviews with 275 avocado farmers, 231 avocado traders and 16 key informants. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test and one-way analysis of variance were used for data analysis. The average crop yield ranged from 76 to 124 kg plant(-1) between regions. The average price for the farmers' produce ranged from US$ 0.30 to 0.45 kg(-1) between regions. About 72% of the farmers were dissatisfied with avocado business whereas 79% of the traders were pleased with it. A number of challenges were found hindering the development of the avocado industry in Tanzania, which in turn affects the fruit yield and the value chain. Addressing these challenges at the national, regional, district and village levels is important for improving the livelihood of Tanzanian farmers growing this crop, given the fact that a good proportion of the country's population is employed in the agricultural sector and most of the reported challenges also affect the value chain of other crops.

TI  - Digital Control in Value Chains: Challenges of Connectivity for East African Firms
T2  - ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY
AB  - In recent years, Internet connectivity has greatly improved across the African continent. This article examines the consequences that this shift has had for East African firms that are part of global value chains (GVCs). Prior work yielded contradictory expectations: firms might benefit from connectivity through increased efficiencies and improved access to markets, although they might also be further marginalized through increasing control of lead firms. Drawing on extensive qualitative research in Kenya and Rwanda, including 264 interviews, we examine 3 sectors (tea, tourism, and business process outsourcing) exploring overarching, cross-cutting themes. The findings support more pessimistic expectations: small African producers are only thinly digitally integrated in GVCs. Moreover, shifting modes of value chain governance, supported by lead firms and facilitated by digital information platforms and data standards are leading to new challenges for firms looking to digitally integrate. Nevertheless, we also find examples in these sectors of opportunities where small firms are able to cater to emerging niche customers, and local or regional markets. Overall, the study shows that improving connectivity does not inherently benefit African firms in GVCs without support for complementary capacity and competitive advantages.

TI  - Value chain analysis of malt barley in North western part of Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - This research attempted to analyze value chain of Malt barley in North Western part of Ethiopia in Estie District. The primary data were collected from 121 malt barley producer farmers selected through two stage sampling technique and from other respective actors. To analyze the data, both descriptive and econometric analytical tools were applied. From Malt barley value chain actors, the chain is governed mainly by malt factory with the assistance of primary cooperatives and cooperative union. From three market channels, channel three product passes from produces to malt factory through primary cooperatives and union is the major marketing channel for malt barley product. The highest gross marketing margin (62.9%) was shared by malt factory, but the profit margin was highest for producers (53.4%). Multiple linear regression model results show that six variables such as education level of the household, farming experiences in malt barley production, choice of contract agreement, availability of active labor force, credit access and land allocated to malt barley production significantly and positively affect the quantity supply of malt barley product. The results of the study, therefore, suggested that policy implications drawn from the study findings include the need to improve the input supply such as improved seed, improving farmers' knowledge and experience on malt barley production, encouraging adult education, expanding accessibility of credit and improve market infrastructure.

TI  - Socioeconomic Determinants of Crop Diversity and Its Effect on Farmer Income in Guangxi, Southern China
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Encouraging crop diversity could be a "win-win" for farmers and biodiversity conservation, if having a variety of crops produces the heterogeneity that supports biodiversity, and if multiple crops decrease the risk of farmers to losses due to pests, climatic events or market fluctuations, without strongly reducing their incomes. However, data on the factors that influence the decision to plant multiple crops, and how that affects profit, are needed, especially for East Asia, where these questions have been little studied. We distributed a questionnaire on these issues to 301 farmers in 35 villages in an agricultural area close to the city of Nanning in Guangxi, south China. Crop diversity increased with land size and closeness to the city. We detected no relationship between profit variability and crop diversity, but farmers with greater crop diversity and more land were more profitable, a result driven by several rarely planted but lucrative types of crops. Crop diversity can be a focus for policy to improve farmers' livelihoods; these policies need to encourage farmers with little land to form cooperatives. Further research is needed to understand the effect of crop diversity on profit variability, and in areas closer to protected areas where biodiversity is higher.

TI  - Governance structures and price volatility perceptions in the Indonesian chilli value chain
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to analyse the governance structures of the Indonesian chilli value chain, price volatility issues across the chain and to critically explore the value chain actors' perceptions and responses to price volatility. Design/methodology/approach The authors used semi-structured interviews with 148 primary actors of the Indonesian chilli value chain. In-depth interviews with 22 key stakeholders - from local, provincial and national levels - were conducted in order to obtain additional information about their roles and the current policies and challenges in the chilli industry. The authors also conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with farmers and support providers and held a national workshop to gather governance and price volatility risk-related information. Findings The Indonesian chilli value chains are long, complex and involve multiple actors. Most relationships within the value chains are based on market governance in which price regulates transactions. Most value chain actors shared a similar perception of price volatility and its causes. Under different governance structures, the value chain actors identified production, product characteristics and marketing as a major cause of price volatility. Although strategies applied by the value chain actors varied, in the main they are all aimed at minimising the impact of price volatility. Contractual arrangements are viable alternatives to minimising price risk. Research limitations/implications This research relies primarily on qualitative data derived from purposive data collection methods, which may reduce the ability to generalise the findings. A quantitative analysis is required to validate the level of price volatility perceived by the stakeholders and to assess the cause and impact of price volatility across the chain. Future research should focus on proposing and assessing potential policy interventions that address price volatility, in order to facilitate the development of the Indonesian chilli industry. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the governance structures of the Indonesia chilli value chain, the value chain actors' perceptions of price volatility and their responses under the different types of governance in a developing country context.

TI  - Lao Plantation Policy: Prospects for Change
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Policies to promote tree plantations in the Lao People's Democratic Republic have been developed since independence to support national socio-economic and environmental goals, and in response to domestic and international markets. The effectiveness of these policies has been variable, and the resulting plantation wood value chains are poorly developed due to contradictory and confusing laws and regulations with inconsistent application and high transaction costs. Consequently, there has been limited tree plantation investment, and few investments have realized the anticipated benefits. Renewed interest in plantations from the government, investors and other sectors in Laos has prompted policy reviews and recognition of the need for new policy settings. We reviewed the development of plantation policies in Laos and assessed policy effectiveness and barriers to policy options. Through document analysis, interviews with key stakeholders and actors, stakeholder forums, and field research, we found that smarter regulation, and facilitating value-chain partnerships and knowledge sharing, can motivate smallholders and industry investors in plantations, and increase community-level benefits and financial returns to the Government and private sector. These results are discussed in the context of current international developments in plantation policy and the convergence in related policy processes in Laos.

TI  - A social network analysis of the Philippine seaweed farming industry: Unravelling the web
T2  - MARINE POLICY
AB  - Seaweed farming is a major economic endeavor among the households in the key seaweed-production areas in the Philippines because of its high profitability potential relative to farming effort. This study used Social Network Analysis (SNA) to explore the social structure and the nature of support mechanism at the production segment of the seaweed value chain to understand the differential access of women and men to information, resources, and services. The data was obtained from Focus Group Discussions (FGD) with 115 seaweed farmers in Zamboanga City, Bohol, and Tawi-Tawi. The resulting social support maps show a strong reliance on internal support sources (e.g. family) across the selected parameters (training, farm preparations, product flow) and a gender difference on the extent of access to external sources. This study highlighted the relevance of using SNA in value chain analysis (VCA) to understand the relationship patterns among the actors and their implications on policy making and overall governance of the seaweed industry.

TI  - Women's time use and implications for participation in cacao value chains: evidence from VRAEM, Peru
T2  - DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE
AB  - Bringing inclusion into value chain development requires interventions that account for gender-based constraints and opportunities. Key determinants of women's capacity to participate are their availability and access to interventions. Twenty-four-hour recall surveys with 53 women from households engaged in a cacao expansion intervention in Peru found women with a strong interest in cacao; however, participation was thwarted by household responsibilities and exclusion from training. Findings emphasise the need to actively engage women in intervention design, and monitor and evaluate their time use, recognising the unintended consequences of increased time investments, and hence the unexpected impacts of these development interventions.

TI  - Opportunities and bottlenecks for upstream learning within RSPO certified palm oil value chains: A comparative analysis between Indonesia and Thailand
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Smallholders play a key role in implementing best management practices that increase productivity and reduce environmental effects. However, they often lack the knowledge to implement these standards. This study investigates if and how RSPO certification fosters upstream learning to improve farming practices. Taking a comparative approach between Thailand and Indonesia we find that the current structure of the value chain is not always well-suited for upstream learning beyond knowledge transfer. In particular, farmers in Indonesia suffer from the delegation of practices to the mill and cooperative, and from incentive-incompatible pricing practices, limiting the extent to which farmers absorb new knowledge on farming practices. In Thailand instead, price incentives based on quality are more developed, and only hindered by the presence of intermediary collectors. This makes that Thai farmers are systematically more aware of farming and environmental practices, and more likely to report compliance with RSPO principles and criteria. Their relatively higher independence in farming decision-making, however, results in weaker peer-to-peer interactions and higher deviations from best management practices, with consequences both for productivity and quality. This research highlights the major bottlenecks in upstream learning within RSPO-certified palm oil value chains in Indonesia and Thailand. Addressing such bottlenecks is a precondition to improving smallholders' farming practices.

TI  - Identification of production challenges and benefits using value chain mapping of egg food systems in Nairobi, Kenya
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Commercial layer and indigenous chicken farming in Nairobi and associated activities in the egg value chains are a source of livelihood for urban families. A value chain mapping framework was used to describe types of inputs and outputs from chicken farms, challenges faced by producers and their disease control strategies. Commercial layer farms were defined as farms keeping exotic breeds of chicken, whereas indigenous chicken farms kept different cross breeds of indigenous chicken. Four focus group discussions were held with producers of these chickens in pert-urban area: Dagoretti, and one informal settlement: Kibera. Qualitative data were collected on interactions between farmers, sources of farm inputs and buyers of poultry products, simple ranking of production challenges, farmers' perception on diseases affecting chicken and strategies for management of sick chicken and waste products. Value chain profiles were drawn showing sources of inputs and channels for distribution of chicken products. Production challenges and chicken disease management strategies were presented as qualitative summaries. Commercial layer farms in Dagoretti kept an average of 250 chickens (range 50-500); while flock sizes in Kibera were 12 chickens (range 5-20). Farms keeping indigenous chicken had an average of 23 chickens (range 8-40) in Dagoretti, and 10 chickens (range 5-16) in Kibera. Commercial layer farms in Dagoretti obtained chicks from distributors of commercial hatcheries, but farms in Kibera obtained chicks from hawkers who in turn sourced them from distributors of commercial hatcheries. Indigenous chicken farms from Dagoretti relied on natural hatching of fertilised eggs, but indigenous chicken farms in Kibera obtained chicks from their social connection with communities living in rural areas. Outlets for eggs from commercial layer farms included local shops, brokers, restaurants and hawkers, while eggs from indigenous chicken farms were sold to neighbours and restaurants. Sieved chicken manure from Dagoretti area was fed to dairy cattle; whereas non-sieved manure was used as fertilizer on crops. Production challenges included poor feed quality, lack of space for expansion, insecurity, occurrence of diseases and lack of sources of information on chicken management. In Kibera, sick and dead chickens were slaughtered and consumed by households; this practice was not reported in Dagoretti. The chicken layer systems contribute to food security of urban households, yet they have vulnerabilities and deficiencies with regard to disease management and food safety that need to be addressed with support on research and extension.

TI  - Urban proximity, access to value chains, and dairy productivity in Ethiopia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This article analyzes how urban proximity introduces spatial heterogeneity in farm productivity within the high-value dairy sector in one of the poorest countries in Africa, Ethiopia. We look at how urban proximity-measured as travel time-affects the decisions and productivity of milk farmers located in rural production zones serving fresh milk to the capital Addis Ababa. Using an instrumental variable approach, we find that with each additional hour of travel time, farmers' milk productivity per cow is reduced, on average, by almost 1 L per day or by 26%. When trying to disentangle the underlying mechanisms (and controlling for transaction costs), we find that farmers' inclusion in "modern" value chains and their access to commercial milk buyers and milk processing companies drive the urban proximity effect. As only a limited number of farmers have access to such value chains in developing countries, measures to make dairy value chains more inclusive to remote-often poorer-farmers can, therefore, have important benefits for them, for the performance of the dairy sector in Ethiopia, and for the process of agricultural transformation as a whole.

TI  - CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR VALUE CHAIN ANALYSIS FOR POVERTY ALLEVIATION AMONG SMALLHOLDER FARMERS
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - Despite volumes of research and substantial investments by government, the financial performance of smallholder farmers in South Africa remains poor. The past decade saw little change in the general behaviour of smallholder farmers, and the stumbling blocks faced by smallholder farmers who want to participate in commercial agri-food chains. A possible reason may be that researchers tend to focus on the current behaviour and performance of the farmers while neglecting the influence of the incentive structure on their behaviour. The aim of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework that allows for a more holistic analysis of farmers and their value chains to better understand the reasons underlying current behaviour, and to identify potential solutions to change the behaviour of the farmers and relevant role-players to better match the requirements for successfully participating in competitive agri-food chains. The integrated value chain, New Institutional Economics - Structure-Conduct-Performance framework, does allow for a comprehensive analysis of the incentive structure embedded in the social, physical and institutional environment within which the farmers operate. Special attention is also awarded to the relationship between the farmers and their buyers to identify the appropriate coordination strategy that will minimise transaction costs.

TI  - Examining the interface of sustainability programmes and livelihoods in the Semendo highlands of Indonesia
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC VIEWPOINT
AB  - Voluntary sustainability standards are used as both a means of securing coffee supply by large coffee firms and a development intervention to address rural poverty and environmental management in the Global South. Using a case-study approach, we have examined the interface between a value-chain sustainability programme and the livelihood trajectories of smallholder producers in upland Sumatra. Our research found the programme has had minimal impacts for coffee producers to date. The level of commitment required of producers appears incompatible with the particular way that coffee is currently embedded within local landscapes, livelihoods and poverty alleviation pathways. Various sustainability standards articulate a narrative of rural development underpinned by an assumption that agricultural modernisation is the preferred pathway out of poverty for rural households. As a result, there is some risk that sustainability programmes may be inadvertently attempting to encourage household investment in a particular kind of agriculture, which is intended to assist sustainability of supply, but is poorly aligned with prevailing processes of poverty alleviation. These observations are based on a detailed study of agrarian change among the Semendo people of South Sumatra province, where processes of rural development are far more complex than assumptions presented by mainstream sustainability standards.

TI  - Improving Indonesia?s timber legality and sustainability verification system: Proposals based on case studies of natural forest-, corporate tree plantation- and smallholder-based value chains
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - All Indonesian wood value chains are regulated by a national Timber Legality and Sustainability Verification System (SVLK), based on timber legality and forest sustainability standards. We draw on three prior case studies, of natural forest-, corporate plantation-, and smallholder-based wood products value chains, to investigate SVLK architecture, implementation and compliance; and on regulatory theory to interpret these results and suggest how SVLK might be improved. Case study results demonstrate that SVLK has fostered legality and sustainability compliance in the natural forest-and corporate plantation-based value chains dominated by large-scale actors, but not in the smallholder-based chain in which the majority of actors are also small-scale. Results also reveal problematic elements of SVLK related to the roles of both large-and small-scale actors, legality and sustainability standards, a fragmented wood traceability system, inadequate independent monitoring and witness auditing, ineffective compliance mechanisms, and small-scale actors. Recent revisions of SVLK have not addressed these limitations, and we propose improvements: revisiting national legality and sustainability standards, placing more emphasis on field performance in sustainability assessments, limiting auditors' flexibility, integrating all online wood systems and limiting access to only SVLK-verified actors, adopting a product classification, and increasing resources for and the frequency of witness audit and independent monitoring. Stronger cooperation between responsible Ministries and agencies is necessary to improve compliance. SVLK could learn from and cooperate with voluntary certification systems to develop more 'joined up' timber legality and forest governance regimes in Indonesia.

TI  - Best-bet channels for integrated soil fertility management communication and dissemination along the agricultural product value-chain: a comparison of northern Ghana and western Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION & EXTENSION
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this paper is to comparatively assess the most suitable channels for dissemination of agricultural innovations along the entire information value chain.
   Design/Methodology/Approach: We calculated information scores to measure channel preference from a randomly selected sample of farmers: 285 in Tamale, Ghana and 300 in Kakamega, Kenya. Using t-tests we compared the information score differences of different channels between farmers who adopted Integrated Soil Fertility Management and those who did not.
   Findings: The highest information scores were observed for radio along the entire value chain for both locations. However, farmers in Tamale prefered interpersonal channels for processing information. Radio and farmer field days had the highest rankings for production information at both locations. Radio, workshops and interpersonal channels (traders and neighbours/friends/relatives) were best-bet channels for marketing and procesing information.
   Practical implication: Extension agents should place more emphasis on channels such as radio, farmer field days, and workshops as they may offer more efficient delivery of information packages at all levels, whilst recognizing the central role of interpersonal channels.
   Theoretical implication: The nexus between the uses and gratification, adoption, diffusion of innovations theories and the collaborative communication theory on one hand, and the agricultural product value chain framework on the other, is highlighted. Farmers' preference for information channels is not predicated on the stage of the value chain.
   Originality/Value: In the current context of weak agricultural knowledge and innovation systems in African agriculture, agricultural producers are poorly informed about the current innovations. This study furnishes empirical evidence on the best-bet information channels to be used by extension workers and change agents to disseminate and communicate system innovations.

TI  - Teak plantation smallholders in Lao PDR: what influences compliance with plantation regulations?
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY
AB  - Past policies to promote the planting of trees by smallholders have been effective in Lao PDR. In Luang Prabang Province over 15 000ha of teak (Tectona grandis) have been established. New policies to stop illegal logging, promote timber legality of wood exports and encourage domestic wood processing aim to mobilise this teak resource as an alternative to timber from natural forests. Several factors are thought to inhibit smallholder participation in the timber value chain and this risks their exclusion from international markets. These factors include the hidden nature of their teak plantation resource, inability to comply with complex regulations and limited capacity to engage with markets. This paper explores the policy and regulatory environment for smallholder plantation teak to understand how instrumental and normative factors may influence compliance with plantation regulations and affect participation in new governance structures such as grower groups. The results emphasise the need for policies, regulations and governance to take into account the human factor if value chains that depend on smallholder plantations are to be effective.

TI  - Institutional Strengthening of Farmer Producer Organizations and Empowerment of Small Farmers in India: Evidence from a Case Study in Maharashtra
T2  - MILLENNIAL ASIA
AB  - Small and marginal farmers contribute significantly to agricultural production and livelihoods all over the world. The small size of operational holdings, however, makes them highly susceptible to market risks leading to low levels of farm income. The farmer producer organizations (FPOs) are considered as effective mechanisms as they give voice to the small farmers, help overcome the challenges, by reducing the transaction costs and improving market access. However, in India, farmer collectives suffer from several institutional and structural impediments that affects their performance and thereby not resulting in empowerment and wellbeing of the farmers. In this regard, this article discusses the role of FPOs based on an empirical case study of Sahyadri Farmers Producer Company Ltd (SFPCL) from Maharashtra. The case study analyses the specificities of a private initiative such as Sahyadri, which focuses on making farming viable for farmers with small holdings in particular. The Sahyadri model contributes building the social capital of the farmers and improving the farm income and sustainable livelihoods. The article uses logistic regression to determine the factors influencing collective action and the Cobb-Douglas (CD) Production function to highlight the economic benefits realized by the farmers from being members of the Farmers Producer Company in case of Sahyadri in Maharashtra.

TI  - Analysis of the potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) value chain in Zimbabwe
T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - The performance of the Irish potato sector in Zimbabwe is not well understood. Using value chain analysis, this article evaluated the potato industry using quantitative data gathered from stakeholders using structured questionnaires, field observations, local knowledge and expert consultation. About 65% of potato production is processed as French fries and less than 35% for household fresh consumption. Average fresh potato household per capita consumption was 34 kg per year, while the total per capita consumption was 9 kg per year. Gross profit estimated at each linkage was at least 13%. Major factors impacting on the value chain performance relate to high production costs, low yields and a lack of farmer training. Potato marketing is also hampered by the poor road network in the country. The research recommends a lowering of production costs, supplying high yielding cultivars, providing credit facilities, guaranteed land ownership and improving the country's road network.

TI  - Impact of an Agricultural Value Chain Project on Smallholder Farmers, Households, and Children in Liberia
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We explore the impact of a rural agricultural value chain project in Liberia on smallholder farmers, their households and children in order to better understand the link between household economic welfare and child wellbeing. Drawing on longitudinal field based quasi-experimental survey data, we estimate the causal effect of the project on the use of modern farming techniques and production, household assets and food security, and child education, health and nutrition. Mixed-methods include multiple rounds of focus groups with farmers, key informant interviews with community leaders, and project monitoring farmer diaries. Treatment farmers showed increased use of modern farming techniques and improved production, households experienced greater access to food, and while no significant changes were found for children, for the outcomes of interest, treatment children outcomes trended in the positive direction. The evaluation suggests that participation in agricultural value chain interventions contributes to positive farm outcomes and social assets, but economic-focused activities alone are insufficient to improve children's lives. Since improving the lives of children from birth is critical to breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty, economic strengthening programs like value chain interventions, must monitor their effects on children: to do no harm and to identify and take advantage of opportunities to improve the lives of children.

TI  - Incorporating orange-fleshed sweet potato into the food system as a strategy for improved nutrition: The context of South Africa
T2  - FOOD RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) is considered the single most successful example of biofortification of a staple crop, and presents a feasible option to address vitamin A deficiency. Though initially promoted as part of a crop-based approach focusing on production and consumption at household level, it evolved into small-scale commercial production, predominantly in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper reviews OFSP initiatives in relation to the South African food environment and food supply systems, also identifying opportunities for scaling out OFSP in a situation where sweet potato is not eaten as a staple. Current per capita consumption of sweet potato is low; the focus is thus on increasing consumption of OFSP, rather than replacing cream-fleshed varieties. For the major OFSP variety, Bophelo, 66 g consumption can be sufficient to meet the recommended daily allowance for 1-3 year old children (300 mu RE vitamin A). Despite a national Vitamin A supplementation programme and fortified staple foods in South Africa, 43.6% of children under 5 years of age were reported to be vitamin A deficient in 2012, indicating a stronger need to promote the consumption of Vitamin A-rich foods, such as OFSP. To increase availability of and access to OFSP, all aspects of the food supply system need to be considered, including agricultural production, trade, food transformation and food retail and provisioning. Currently, small-scale commercial OFSP producers in South Africa prefer to deliver their produce to local informal markets. To enter the formal market, small-scale producers often have difficulties to meet the high standards of the retailers' centralised procurement system in terms of food quality, quantity and safety. Large retailers may have the power to increase the demand of OFSP, not just by improving availability but also by developing marketing strategies to raise awareness of the health benefits of OFSP. However, currently the largest scope for scaling out is through a number of public sector programmes such as the National School Nutrition Programme, Community Nutrition and Development Centres, Small-holder Farmer programmes and Agriparks. Though the major approach is focused on unprocessed, boiled OFSP, there are unexploited opportunities for processing of OFSP. However, the nutritional quality of products should be a main consideration within the context of the co-existence of undernutrition, overnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies in the country.

TI  - Bridging the credit gap for sustainable medicinal plant value chain development in Northwestern Vietnam
T2  - AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the existence and determinants of the credit gap in the cinnamon value chain development in Northwestern Vietnam. Design/methodology/approach A multi-stage sampling of 548 cinnamon households and a Heckman Selection Model were applied to examine their credit access constraints. In-depth interviews with cooperatives, enterprises, banks and relevant government agencies were further conducted to explain the credit gap. Findings In the total 52.74 percent of households that received credit, 24.56 percent of them received an insufficient amount of credit as registered. In addition, 35.77 percent of total households are credit rationed. Although all enterprises and cooperatives had been successful in applying for credit as long as they have collateral, none of them received the full credit amount requested. The credit amount received satisfied 80.64, 43.03 and 44.28 percent of the demand by households, cooperatives and enterprises, respectively. The lack of valuable collateral assets is the most important factor explaining this credit gap. Moreover, membership in a farmer-based union or ownership of a bank account increases the probability of access to credit. Educated household heads with a larger farm size and the Kinh ethnic majority are positively associated with a larger amount of credit. Households with conventional cinnamon farming, more dependents and union non-membership are more likely to be credit rationed. Practical implications - A reform on collateral management, facilitating access to bank accounts, capacity building for local farmer-based unions, organic certification, granting land use rights and facilitating a platform to share reliable information between relevant actors are needed to bridge the credit gap. Originality/value This paper analyses the determinants of credit access constraints by key actors in a medicinal plant value chain that was insufficiently discussed by previous studies in the field.

TI  - The COVID-19 Induced Disruptions across Groundnut Value Chain: Empirical Evidence from South India
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - We study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the groundnut value chain and all the actors involved in its value chain in Ananthapuramu district of Andhra Pradesh, a leading groundnut producing state in south India. The results revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic created a double burden on farmers by disrupting farm production on one side and decreased diet diversity on the other. Disruption in farm productions resulted in a decline in household income and increased consumer food prices. The effect on farmers snowballed to other actors in the value chain, and all the actors were affected variably. Availability of storage infrastructure would have saved the farmer's household income to some extent during the pandemic. Supply of diverse nutrient foods through the existing public distribution system, which mostly provides wheat and rice, might have helped tackle the diet diversity issue amongst farmers. Farmer's collectives were perceived to reduce the negative impact during natural disasters like the COVID-19 pandemic by helping to organise smallholder farmers, minimise transaction costs and increase their bargaining power. In addition, effective farm extension services, including market information, could have benefited farmers during the crisis.

TI  - Rural youth interest in economic activities along the agricultural value chain: empirical evidence from KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) and implications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Identifying which agricultural activities rural youth would be interested to participate in and understanding which factors are enabling and constraining their participation is essential in attempting to alleviate rural youth unemployment and ameliorate the poor succession plan in smallholder agriculture. Employing a recent household survey dataset, descriptive statistics, and multinomial logit regression, this study sought to examine this issue. A structured questionnaire was designed and administered to 152 rural youth from Amajuba and Umzinyathi districts in KwaZulu-Natal Province. The study showed that rural youth are interested in engaging in all activities along the agricultural value chain. The factors enhancing their interest include access to resources and services (agricultural training, land, information, and communication technologies), age, and having a household member engaged in agriculture. However, access to other resources and services (formal education, social media, finance, psychological capital, and wealth), and dependency ratio were found to negatively affect their interest. These findings suggest that policymakers should formulate strategies that are sensitive to the resource endowment and access to services of the rural youth when aiming at engaging them in agricultural activities.

TI  - The carbon footprints of alternative value chains for biomass energy for cooking in Kenya and Tanzania
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
AB  - Due to its availability and affordability for poorer populations, wood- based biomass energy remains vital in meeting local energy demands - especially for cooking fuel - in many regions of the developing world. However, increasing feedstock scarcity (e. g. due to deforestation) coupled with the negative socioeconomic and environmental outcomes of inefficient production and consumption technologies make it imperative to identify alternative energy solutions that benefit people without harming the environment. Indeed, tackling energy poverty is crucial to efforts aimed at meeting sustainable development goals at the household level. However, interventions aimed at reducing energy poverty must simultaneously seek solutions that might reduce people's carbon footprint. Carbon footprints, or the amounts of greenhouse gas emissions linked to particular activities, are associated with climate change and its impacts. Globally, calls have intensified to reduce the carbon footprint of energy use, including use of biomass fuels. Locally, climate change issues are increasingly seen as posing particular threats to already vulnerable communities. The present paper evaluates the carbon footprints of alternative biomass energy solutions for cooking, as one key aspect of their environmental performance. It compares the carbon footprints of firewood, charcoal, biogas, jatropha oil, and crop residue briquettes. The research focuses on selected technologies for biomass energy production and consumption in two case study sites in rural and urban contexts of Kenya and Tanzania. Carbon footprinting is applied as a methodological approach to evaluating technological options for sustainable development in developing economies undergoing rapid population growth, urbanization, and industrial development. Results indicate that the unimproved charcoal value chain has a big carbon footprint. The value chain for jatropha oil appears to hold the greatest potential for carbon footprint reductions, as long as the feedstock is grown in the form of hedges around plots. However, the limited yield potential of hedges calls into question the economic viability of this solution. Results further show that carbon footprinting can help to raise awareness and inform stakeholders and decision- makers about alternative, environmentally more suitable biomass energy value chains. However, any assessment of the overall sustainability of these value chains should also integrate socio- economic aspects and factors influencing adoption. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - The Role of Emotion and Calculative Self-Interest in Trust Perception:Case of the Dairy Value Chain
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN BUSINESS
AB  - Trust among actors plays an important role in contracting decisions and cooperative membership. There is, however, a concern to understand trust development and the determinants of trust perception. In this paper, trust perception is explained by emotions and calculative self-interest along with other predictors, namely transaction costs in the value chain exchange. We assume that emotional non-calculative trust and calculative self-interest are both present in local rural economies, making this context appropriate to test our hypothesis regarding the importance of emotional links in networking and contracting along the value chain. We used a sample of breeders in a local community to construct the emotional non-calculative self-interest and the calculative self-interest components and investigated how these two indicators contribute to generate trust perception. In addition, transaction costs related to opportunism, uncertainty and, dependency have strong effect on trust perception. The results provide support that emotional non-calculative self-interest fosters trust perception; despite opportunistic behavior and distrust, breeders are able to build trusty links using close relationships. Smallholder dairy farmers could use existing social networks to control high transaction costs, to foster trust and institute sustainable contracts as a way to coordinate transactions.

TI  - Empowerment in agricultural value chains: Mixed methods evidence from the Philippines
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Women's participation and empowerment in value chains are goals of many development organizations, but there has been limited systematic, rigorous research to track these goals between and within value chains (VCs). We adapt the survey-based project-level Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-WEAI) to measure women's and men's empowerment in the abaca, coconut, seaweed, and swine VCs in the Philippines and to investigate the correlates of empowerment. Results show that most women and men in all four VCs are disempowered, but unlike in many other countries, Filipino women in this sample are generally as empowered as men. Pro-WEAI results suggest that respect within the household and attitudes about gender-based violence (GBV) are the largest sources of disempowerment for both women and men, followed by control over use of income and autonomy in income-related decisions. Excessive workload and lack of group membership are other important sources of disempowerment, with some variation across VCs and nodes along VCs. Across all four VCs, access to community programs is associated with higher women's empowerment, and access to extension services and education are associated with higher men's empowerment. Our results show that, despite the relatively small gender gaps in the Philippines, persistent gender stereotypes influence men's and women's empowerment and VC participation.

TI  - Paradoxes of Inclusion: Adverse Effects of Inclusive Interventions in Northern Ethiopia
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - The involvement of smallholders in various inclusive business models (IBMs) is being widely promoted in Ethiopia. The inclusion, exclusion and distribution effects of IBMs must be better understood, however, in order to make them more impactful. This study, which was carried out in three districts in northern Ethiopia, employed a mixed methods approach. Our results show that inclusion and exclusion are both complex and multidimensional. A focus on transaction costs, productive resource endowments and chain governance is crucial for enhancing smallholders' inclusion. Our results further indicate that income obtained from participation in IBMs is unequally distributed. The benefits of IBMs vary according to the underlying position of the smallholder. Hence, inclusive development interventions should acknowledge the various positions of smallholders and consider how their positions shape social relations locally. The paper thus reveals the various dimensions, contradictory tendencies, hidden costs and side effects of IBMs.

TI  - Technical efficiency and technological gaps correcting for selectivity bias: Insights from a value chain project in Nepal
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Strengthening linkages with markets along the value chain is a promising pathway to increase agricultural productivity, welfare, and food security of smallholder producers in developing countries. Our study investigates the impact of an integrated value chain project, which linked producer organizations to markets and provided various types of training to their members. Using primary survey data from Nepal, we apply propensity score matching to ensure common support and statistical balance between project (treatment) and non-project (con-trol) households. We implement the selectivity-corrected stochastic production frontier methodology to control for unobservable characteristics and estimate a simulation-based stochastic metafrontier to account for different technological levels between the two groups of households. Comparing results between the translog and Cobb -Douglas production frontiers, we find that the more flexible translog specification shows no signs of selectivity bias while this bias is present with the Cobb-Douglas, motivating the need to correct for selectivity. Our main results from the metafrontier analysis indicate that project impacts are reflected in substantial technological gaps and significant meta-technical efficiency differences in favor of treatment households. Thus, this study shows that strengthening linkages between producers and markets can have a large positive effect on productivity. Het-erogeneity analysis suggests that more vulnerable producers, including those with fewer years of education and smaller farms, receive relatively higher returns from the project compared to their counterparts.

TI  - Limitations of Contract Farming as a Pro-poor Strategy: The Case of Maize Outgrower Schemes in Upper West Ghana
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Contract farming (CF) arrangements have the potential to address market failures and improve technology adoption, productivity, and welfare. In Ghana, government and donors use CF as a strategy for increasing adoption of new agricultural technologies and developing value chains. Yet to date, there has not been a rigorous assessment of these CF schemes.
   The focus in this paper is on different maize-based CF schemes in the poorest and most remote region in Ghana. It assesses the profitability and potential impact of these CF schemes, utilizing a unique plot level dataset that covers two periods of data and two maize plots (scheme and non-scheme) per household, and employing matching techniques and an instrumental variable approach to address selection bias and unobserved heterogeneity across farmers. These are complemented by a community-level survey, in-depth interviews with scheme operators, and a series of key informant interviews. Results show that these schemes led to improved technology adoption and yield increases. In addition, a subset of maize farmers with high yield improvements due to CF participation have high profits. Maize CF schemes also enabled market coordination and consistent supply of quality maize to downstream industries. However, on average, the impact of the CF schemes on profitability is negative, even when input diversion is accounted for. Yield increases are not high enough to compensate for higher input requirements and the cost of capital under the schemes. Despite higher yields, the costs to produce one metric tonne of maize under CF schemes are higher than on maize farms without CF schemes, twice that of several countries in Africa, and more than seven times higher than that of major maize-exporting countries (the United States, Brazil, and Argentina). Sustainability of these CF schemes will largely depend on developing and promoting much-improved varieties and technologies that boost yields in order to compensate for the high input and credit costs.

TI  - Improving smallholder livelihoods and ecosystems through direct trade relations: High-quality cocoa producers in Ecuador
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Global trade in niche commodities has increased the influence of consumers' choices on land use change and livelihoods in developing rural areas. New niche commodity markets for fine cocoa-produced by old tree varieties frequently grown in shaded agroforestry systems-create more direct linkages between producers and buyers. We explored the socioeconomic and environmental outcomes for cocoa smallholders that participated in direct trade relations compared with smallholders that sold through mainstream markets. Household interviews were conducted with cocoa smallholders in northern Ecuador. Biodiversity conditions at farm level were monitored for 75% of surveyed households. Using a counterfactual based on genetic matching, we found that smallholders engaged in direct trade (a) captured superior prices for cocoa sales; (b) had greater access to agricultural training, technical assistance, and improved social networks; and (b) applied more nature-friendly management practices, compared with smallholders selling through mainstream markets. However, a strong overlap between direct trading practices and organic certification made attribution of environmental benefits difficult. This overlap likely explained why farmers engaged in direct trade used more organic fertilizers and less herbicide. Shade level and plant species richness and abundance in plantations were unrelated to market participation. Additional qualitative analyses suggest that certification facilitates engagement in direct trade and that some direct buyers request certification. This study provides insights on the potential of developing value chain innovations for high-quality commodity trade. The success of value chain innovations hinges on the competitiveness of farmers' cooperatives and involvement of governments, nongovernmental organizations, and private actors.

TI  - Socio-Economic Characterisation of Resettled Smallholder Farmers in Rural Zimbabwe
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN AND AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - The socio-economic characterisation of resettled small-holder farmers under the Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP) in Zimbabwe has blind spots in relation to the emergent transformative social policy features such as 'social cohesion', 'cooperation', 'protection' and 'accumulation' which are equally important among land beneficiaries. Using the Sangwe farm, this article departs from the conventional use of the political economy, sustainable livelihoods, human rights-based and neo-patrimonial approaches to experiment with the transformative social policy approach. Using both quantitative and qualitative data in an exploratory research design, the article shows that viewed from the transformative social policy approach, the FTLRP was neither a resounding success nor a complete disaster. The programme actually produced mixed results. The article thus, recommends the use of in-depth, ideologically free and neutral approaches in its analysis so as to reveal its detailed outcomes. Additional studies in which existing land reform policies can be considered in the collective efforts of improving the transformative agenda of the FTLRP across the country are needed.

T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We use global value chain (GVC) theory to understand governance of Vietnam's shrimp farming industry. We describe this GVC as buyer-driven with important food safety standards imposed by governments of importing countries and new certification systems promoted by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Governance relations are clear between governments in importing countries and Vietnam, and between importers and NGOs. Governance relations become more fragmented further down the chain where large numbers of small-scale producers and traders operate. This fragmentation may adversely affect access to the most lucrative markets and have the unanticipated effect of marginalizing small-scale farmers and traders. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Redesigning oilseed tree biofuel systems in India
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Liquid biofuel production has been widely promoted as a rural development strategy in the South. Yet, the development of biofuel value chains faces many context-specific challenges. In this empirical study we use a labelled choice experiment to assess smallholder farmer preferences for alternative production systems, value chain organisations and market developments for a biofuel program using oilseed trees (neem (Azadirachta indica), pongamia (Millettia pinnate), mahua (Madhuca longifolia)) in Karnataka state, India. Our results demonstrate that biofuel programs can benefit from ex ante analyses to improve their design. We find that most farmers (71%) are likely to adopt biofuel trees in most scenarios, especially species with relatively high yields, low labour requirements and high oilseed prices. Nevertheless, value chain reorganization through contracting and labour provision proves to be the key lever to stimulate adoption. This calls for further research on effective contract design and implementation, and for developing alternative business models. Our results imply that next to high opportunity costs of land, also high opportunity costs of labour can be a barrier to biofuel tree adoption. If biofuel programs are to succeed, they have to move beyond the idea of smallholder biofuel production on marginal lands with surplus labour.

TI  - Risk Factors for African Swine Fever in Smallholder Pig Production Systems in Uganda
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - Smallholder pig production in Uganda is constrained by poor management and high disease burden, with African swine fever (ASF) being one of the most important contributors. However, data to develop appropriate evidence-based disease mitigating interventions along the pig value chain are lacking. This study aimed at determining risk factors associated with the occurrence of outbreaks of ASF in selected districts. A cross-sectional survey of 1195 pig-keeping households in three districts was carried out between April and July 2013. Households were classified into one of three value chain domains (VCDs) based on where the production was located and where most of the products were sold: rural-rural (R-R), rural-urban (R-U) and urban-urban (U-U). Findings revealed that crop farming is the most common primary activity in the R-R and R-U VCDs, while pig keeping was the most common primary activity in the U-U VCDs. Pigs are mostly kept tethered or left to roam in the R-R and R-U VCDs, while in the U-U VCDs, they are mostly confined in corrals. Nearly 20% of the farmers whose farms were hit by an ASF outbreak subsequently sold all their pigs (healthy and sick) to the market in panic. Factors that positively correlated with recent ASF outbreaks were prompt disposal of dead pigs on farms (P<0.001, OR=2.3), wild animals present in the village (P<0.001, OR=1.7) and farmers sourcing drugs from stockists (P<0.001, OR=1.6); while protective factors were the presence of perimeter fences (P=0.03, OR=0.5), attendance of farmers at secondary-school level and above (P<0.001, OR=0.6), routine cleaning of the pig pens (P<0.001, OR=0.6) and pigs being the only livestock kept by farmer (P=0.01, OR=0.7). Given the current situation, there is a need to raise awareness among farmers and other value chain actors of biosecurity measures and create incentives for farmers to report ASF cases.

TI  - Climate Risk and Technology Adoption in the Midstream of Crop Value Chains: Evidence from Nigerian Maize Traders
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Climate induced events exacerbate food production and distribution risks, posing a threat to global food security. Though many studies focus on farmer adaptation to climate change, there are few studies of actors in the middle of agricultural value chains such as traders, logistics providers, and processors. The activities of these actors, referred to as the 'hidden middle', are key determinants of the prices received by farmers and the price and quality of food products for consumers. We explore how climate events and risk perceptions affect the adoption of value-adding and damage control strategies among maize traders in Nigeria, Africa's largest economy and most populous country. We find consistent evidence that climate events and climate risk perception discourage the adoption of value-adding practices including storage. This potentially affects the availability and price of maize for consumers (household and industry) in the lean season. However, once traders store maize, climate risk does not affect the adoption of damage control, but training and social networks do. These findings suggest that actors in the midstream of food value chains are responding to climate change and more attention needs to be paid to these actors to maintain the availability of affordable and safe maize products throughout the year. There is also a need for strategies to reduce the risks of trading activities due to climate change.

TI  - Inclusive productive value chains, an overview of Indonesia's cocoa industry
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The inclusiveness of smallholder cocoa farmers in the international cocoa value chain is addressed in the context of institutional voids through linkages with different business models in the region of Bali, West-Sumatra and West-Sulawesi. Being the third highest producer of cocoa, local farmers have a high dependency on cocoa cultivation; however, they lack policies that foster and reward sustainable high-quality cocoa according to international standards. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach An explanatory multiple-case study design assessed the relevance of partnerships in contributing to sustainable local development and inclusiveness for smallholder farmers. The selected business models, business supported, NGO supported and government supported, are evaluated through improved access to finance, training, technology, subsidized inputs and markets. Findings The paper found that a linkage with a business-supported model, here BT COCOA, achieves the best results in terms of improved yields, quality and farmer's welfare, indicating improved inclusiveness via successful process upgrading. Yet, future cooperation between stakeholders should improve on access to information and finance. Research limitations/implications - The research is a relative research, comparing three models of inclusiveness within one sector (cocoa) in predefined regions of Indonesia. Future research should test the proposed propositions in other agricultural sectors. Practical implications - The paper showcases the effect of support model affiliation for smallholder farmer inclusiveness and the circumvention of institutional voids. It selects the business model as best suitable to achieve smallholder inclusiveness, as well a need to prioritize institutional voids. Originality/value The research is assessing three models addressing inclusiveness applying value chain assessment tools to measure inclusiveness.

TI  - Assessing and Advancing Gender Equity in Lake Malawi's Small-Scale Fisheries Sector
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Women play important, but often invisible, roles in Lake Malawi's small-scale fisheries sector. This paper augments previous research by exploring the productive and reproductive roles that men and women have in fishing communities and how this shapes women's access and control over fisheries resources. Contributing to advancing the understanding of how to strengthen women's roles in the fisheries sector, this paper reports on a qualitative assessment conducted in seven Malawian lakeshore districts. Data collected via focus group discussions, which included gendered resource mapping exercises, revealed belief systems and gender norms that shape men's and women's access to and control over lacustrine resources. While both men and women have access to lake and land resources, their roles differ. Men dominate fishing resources whereas women dominate resources that are tied to household management. While all value chain nodes are open to men, women tend to be concentrated in lower-value processing and trading activities. Social norms and values shape people's access and control over communal resources. It is noteworthy that women who earn an income from the fisheries value chain have more access to savings and credit and have more equal household bargaining power.

TI  - Contracting and gender equity in Tanzania: using a value chain approach to understand the role of gender in organic spice certification
T2  - RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Value chain development (VCD) initiatives within the horticultural and organic sectors in Africa are promising strategies to improve smallholder welfare. Contracting institutional arrangements are a common feature of VCD initiatives and are increasing in number in sub-Saharan Africa as a way to source organic products from smallholder producers. The objective of this study is to better understand men and women's participation in spice producing households that sell under contract and in conventional market chains in the East Usambaras, Tanzania. We draw on New Institutional Economics, political economy and the value chain analysis framework to assess the potential role of contracting to promote gender equity among smallholder organic horticultural producers. We describe intra-household decision making over resources and marketing, access to benefits of contracting, and labor distribution between men and women in contracting and non-contracting households. We then extend the gender analysis to evaluate the role of gender in contracting and conventional value chains operating within the community and district. Using a cross-sectional research design and data collected through 13 focus group discussions, 54 personal interviews and 156 household questionnaires, we show that contracting reduces transaction costs in the chain compared with the conventional trade. However, norms in the wider political economic context give rise to gendered patterns of participation in both household and chain activities in contracting and non-contracting households. Our findings suggest that contracting does not provide significant opportunities for women in married households to participate and benefit based on limited participation in decision-making and access to trainings. Divorced women and widows gain access to contract employment opportunities to earn income. This study highlights the importance of understanding gender relations in the household and community to guide the development of gender equitable VCD initiatives and contracting approaches.

TI  - The impacts of community-based water development projects on rural poverty among small-holder farmers: Evidence from the Ewaso Ng'iro North Catchment Area, Kenya
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - The main challenge with respect to water in the rural setting, lies in access, control and management. Collective action has been taken up following the International Water Management (IWM) principles and institutionalized in the Kenyan legal framework through water resource users' associations (WRUAs). We carried out this study to assess whether this collective action has any impact on household poverty using objective poverty measures (consumption and income), a subjective poverty measure and a water poverty measure. We used 2019 household survey data of 652 randomly selected rural households from the Upper Ewaso Ng'iro North Catchment Area. We employed the full information maximum likelihood endogenous probit regression model to obtain the impact of WRUA membership on household poverty status. We find that collective water management can have welfare improving impacts for rural households, especially where there low public investments in water provision, management and access. We recommend that WRUAs be empowered through financial, legal and capacity building interventions to enhance their community impacts.

TI  - Integration of Smallholders in Modern Agri-food Chains: Lessons from the KASCOL Model in Zambia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - The Kaleya Smallholders Company Limited (KASCOL) model has been considered in Zambia a success in increasing smallholders' participation, ownership and governance in an agri-food value chain. This study explores if and why this was a successful experience. The evidence gathered revealed that along its thirty years of existence, the model was able to grow the smallholder ownership and governance role. Although the context, governance structures and managerial competence were necessary factors in the sustainability of the model, the variables related to social capital were key determinants for the long term successful inclusion of the smallholders.

TI  - Exploring the applicability of a sustainable smallholder sourcing model in the black soybean case in Java
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Food and agribusiness multinational enterprises are redesigning their sourcing strategies to tap into the underused food production potential of small-scale farms in a way that improve farmers' livelihood. The problem is that current widely applied sourcing models do not include improvement of livelihood of the producers/farmers. The present article explores the applicability of a sustainable smallholder sourcing model with a list of critical success factors, in which business objectives and corporate social responsibility perspectives are combined. To this end, the black soybean supply chain in Java/Indonesia is studied. It was found that the black soybean case can be conceptualized by the sourcing model. Most of the critical success factors were present, but also some differences were identified. The differences enable to fine-tune some critical success factors. The sustainable sourcing model can help in (re-) designing sourcing strategies to secure sustainable and more equitable supply from small-scale farmers from a business perspective.

It examines the dynamics of the circulation of land, distinguishing between agrarian arrangements which alter property rights (inheritance, transfer and sale) from those which affect only land use options such as leasing, sharecropping and lending. Additionally, the study addresses two new areas of land legislation, full ownership and commercial companies, mechanisms that might favour the circulation and concentration of land.

TI  - Socio-economic characterisation of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) growers and date value chains in Pakistan
T2  - SPRINGERPLUS
AB  - Increasing food production to feed its rapidly growing population is a major policy goal of Pakistan. The production of traditional staples such as rice (Oryza sativa L.) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has been intensified in many regions, but not in remote, drought-ridden areas. In these arid, marginal environments dates and their by-products are an option to complement staples given their high nutritive value and storability. To fill knowledge gaps about the role of date palm in the household (HH) income of rural communities and the structure of date value chains, this project studied date palm production across six districts in four provinces of Pakistan. During 2012-2013 a total of 170 HHs were interviewed with a structured questionnaire using a snowball sampling approach. The results showed that most of the HH were headed by males (99 %) who were married (74 %) and often illiterate (40 %). Agriculture was the main occupation of date palm growers (56 %), while a few coupled agricultural activities with business (17 %) or extra-farm employment opportunities (government 9 %; private sector 8 %). Date sales contributed >50 % to the total income of 39 % of HH and 90-100 % to 24 % of HH. Overall farmers grew a total of 39 date palm cultivars and cultivated an average of 409 +/- 559 mature date palms. The majority of the respondents sold dates to commission agents (35 %), contractors (22 %) and wholesalers (21 %), while 28 % of HH cultivated date palms only for self-consumption. Date palm growers had only limited knowledge about high quality date cultivars, optimized farm management and about effective post-harvest conservation. Changes in extension and marketing efforts are needed to allow farmers to better exploit value chains in date thereby reaping higher benefits from improved market access to secure their often marginal income.

TI  - Constructing the female coffee farmer: Do corporate smart-economic initiatives promote gender equity within agricultural value chains?
T2  - ECONOMIC ANTHROPOLOGY
AB  - The quest for gender economic equality is becoming a component of corporate and transnational institutional antipoverty initiatives in the Global South. Framed as "smart economics," this approach explicitly ties women's empowerment to economic growth. On one hand, this framework employs a discursive construction that depicts women as attentive, family-oriented entrepreneurs and caregivers who are more likely than their male counterparts to invest in their household and in their children's future; on the other hand, it involves a set of practices that register and reward women's participation. The smart-economics movement operates on both public and private registers, ranging from women-oriented government welfare programs to NGO-managed microcredit schemes and, in this article, corporate actors and public-private partnerships engaged in agricultural value chains. Here we examine recent smart-economic coffee industry initiatives, namely, a case study of microbatched "women's coffee" projects such as Allegro Coffee's Cafe La Duena. We explore how coffee-market value-chain discourses and economic actions affect gendered ideologies and agricultural practices in coffee-producing communities. We compare the impact on members of an Oaxacan (Mexican) fairtrade, organic producer organization that has implemented a women's microbatching coffee initiative relative to other organizations that have not adopted such programs. We find that although the program fails to demonstrate improvements in gender equity by reducing agricultural asset gaps or enhancing women's economic decision-making power, landownership, or access to important agrotechnical services, it does lead to practical changes that are positively correlated with an increase in women's organizational participation, an openness of both women and men to gender-equity programs and services, and women's increased access to land titles. Smart-economic depictions of women as caring entrepreneurs also found a mixed reception in coffee communities: although women producers agreed with the notion that their coffee is superior, their risk aversion countered the entrepreneurial imaginary.

TI  - Oil Palm Contract Farming in Brazil: Labour Constraints and Inclusivity Challenges
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - The Government of Brazil established their Sustainable Palm Oil Production Programme (SPOPP) in 2010, which sought to enhance the sustainability and inclusiveness of oil palm development in the Amazon. This paper evaluates how well oil palm contract farming promoted by SPOPP has delivered on its inclusive development objectives. Drawing on cross-section data collected in Northeast Para, it analyses two recurrent SPOPP themes, namely (1) equitable participation and (2) labour allocation to plantation management. Our analysis demonstrates that household availability of land and labour resources strongly shapes patterns of inclusion and exclusion. Moreover, findings reveal that labour time allocation is influenced by hiring of external labourers, which increases when households are labour and land poor. These results give reason to question the utility of labour-oriented contract farming eligibility criteria, revealing important inclusive business and value chain development dilemmas.

TI  - Building African Agribusiness through Trust and Accountability
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the social institutions of trust, accountability and corporate shared value in creating an enabling environment for private sector investment in African agricultural and food systems.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper uses mixed methods. A value chain framework models interactions among stakeholders in the agriculture, agribusiness and food sectors. The social institutions of accountability and trust are introduced into the model, followed by a Rwanda premium coffee value chain case study.
   Findings The conceptual and case study results show that best practices can increase smallholder farmer, agricultural service provider, financial intermediary, and food processor investments in and benefits from the agriculture sector.
   Research limitations/implications Further research is needed on the economic foundations of development cooperation based on trust, accountability and shared values, best practices and the link with desired societal outcomes, such as the sustainable development goals.
   Social implications Mutual accountability processes, as they are maturing in Africa, are at the cutting edge of creating processes where multiple stakeholders, including agribusiness, can come together to make joint commitments to a shared development agenda, and where stakeholders hold themselves and others accountable for meeting these commitments.
   Originality/value This is the first paper to bring together cutting-edge advances in corporate shared values, trust and accountability in the context of African agricultural and agribusiness development.

TI  - Investigating the Socio-Economic and Livelihoods Impacts of African Swine Fever in Timor-Leste: An Application of Spatial Group Model Building
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - Small-scale pig farming is highly important to the economic and social status of households in Timor-Leste. The presence of an African Swine Fever (ASF) outbreak in Timor-Leste was confirmed in 2019, a major concern given that around 70% of agricultural households practice pig farming. This research used a virtual spatial group model building process to construct a concept model to better understand the main feedback loops that determine the socio-economic and livelihood impacts of the ASF outbreak. After discussing the interaction of reinforcing and balancing feedback loops in the concept model, potential leverage points for intervention are suggested that could reduce the impacts of ASF within socio-economic spheres. These include building trust between small-scale farmers and veterinary technicians, strengthening government veterinary services, and the provision of credit conditional on biosecurity investments to help restock the industry. This conceptual model serves as a starting point for further research and the future development of a quantitative system dynamics (SD) model which would allow ex-ante scenario-testing of various policy and technical mitigation strategies of ASF outbreaks in Timor-Leste and beyond. Lessons learned from the blended offline/online approach to training and workshop facilitation are also explored in the paper.

TI  - Quantitative value chain approaches for animal health and food safety
T2  - FOOD MICROBIOLOGY
CP  - 1st International Symposium on Food Safety (ISFS)
AB  - Economic impact assessments are increasingly important in the context of animal health and food safety, although much of the existing literature does not address the broader systems context in which disease transmission takes place. In this paper, we discuss the role of system dynamics modeling in addressing the value chain impacts associated with animal health and food safety issues. System dynamics methods hold promise as a means of capturing the complex feedbacks that exist between the biology, economics, and behavioral aspects of food safety and animal health systems. We provide a proof-of-concept of this approach in the context of food safety and animal health in the smallholder pig sector of Viet Nam. Results highlight the important tradeoffs that exist between policy objectives and the costs required to achieve them. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of Climate Change on Cotton Production in Bangladesh
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Bangladesh produces only 5% of the cotton she needs to sustain her readymade garments industries. The country has very limited agricultural land and cotton competes with other crops for this scarce land resource. On top of that, Bangladesh is regarded as a country where agriculture is highly vulnerable to the variabilities of weather patterns that result from climate change. Against this backdrop, to better understand the potential for the sustainable expansion of cotton production in Bangladesh, we examine cotton's agricultural value chain and projected climate risks associated with different phases of the chain. We identified associated stakeholders at different phases of cotton production, engaged with them to understand climatic and non-climatic threats and developed an integrated set of recommendations for climate-risk management through improving the connection of producers to markets, increasing economic returns to small farmers, and improving efficiency along the value chain. We discussed our estimated climate projections with stakeholders to understand the challenges at different stages of production and marketing, and together explored and identified probable solutions. This research offers a new and evolving approach to assess climate change impact on agriculture utilizing a holistic approach, which could be adopted for other crops.

TI  - Gender, vegetable value chains, income distribution and access to resources: insights from surveys in Tanzania
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB  - In sub-Saharan countries, male farmers are frequently seen as producers of cash crops and marketable vegetables, while female farmers are perceived as producers of food crops for home consumption. Few authors have tried to validate this perception of gender in the production of traditional vegetables, and gender differences in access to resources and markets remain underexplored. The same holds true for traders of traditional vegetables who share the same value chain. The few studies available have tended to focus either on the household (as the unit of production) or on the market (for trade), neglecting interrelationships between the two. This knowledge gap must be addressed if men and women are to benefit equally from interventions to counteract poverty. A survey of 360 smallholder farmers and 82 vegetable traders in Tanzania was conducted under the "Africa Research in Sustainable Intensification for the Next Generation" program funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and led by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). Its objective was to examine gender relationships within production and within trade, as well as between the actors in both groups. Research foci were on production activities and income, market performance and access to resources as important areas of gendered value chain analysis. Results show no pronounced gender division in the production process, with the exception of pest and disease management, input purchase and seed selection (all predominantly carried out by men). Clear differences between male and female farmers emerged in the allocation of income from various crops. An exploration of why leafy vegetables are grown revealed that the juxtaposition of food crops and cash crops in relation to gender needs to be rethought. Market performance of female producers of leafy vegetables was weaker than that of their male counterparts and that of female traders. Both male and female traders rated their decision-making power as high in relation to the income generated through vegetable sales. For female smallholders, access to land constituted a major constraint. Women in male-headed households had the least contact with extension officers and training. Without careful consideration of these and other results of gender analysis in value chains, interventions are at risk of failing to improve the livelihoods of producers and traders.

TI  - Participatory value chain study for yasi sandalwood (Santalum yasi) in Fiji
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY
AB  - Santalum yasi (yasi) was first exploited in Fiji in the early 1800s and has been harvested periodically but heavily ever since. Yasi produces one of the most valuable sandalwoods, being high in alpha- and beta-santalols and typically meeting the East Indian sandalwood (Santalum album) ISO standard for sandalwood oil. Although wild yasi stands are now near to commercial extinction, they are being replaced by rapidly expanding smallholder plantings throughout the Fiji archipelago. A value chain study is presented for yasi in Fiji for a 35-year period (1984-2018). The study was undertaken in 2018-2019, in a participatory manner, through interviews and consultations with the key value actors, comprising yasi owners and growers, buyers, local buyers and processors, international buyers and processors, and the Fiji Government's Ministry of Forestry. The study's focus was on the main yasi-producing and -processing islands of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Kadavu and the Lau Group. The yasi value chain has been operating suboptimally, with modest returns to tree owners, growers and the Fiji Government, a failure to develop a local yasi-oil and value-adding industry, and, until recently, a lack of yasi replanting. An ongoing constraint to increased plantings of yasi in Fiji is a lack of practical and efficient regulatory and trading frameworks that can provide security of investment for growers, including legal verification (chain of custody) to meet market requirements and curb illegal harvesting. Key findings of this study are: (1) there is a lack of yasi brand recognition and development in the international marketplace due to its substitution for S. album, adversely affecting all actors along the value chain; and (2) there is an opportunity for branding based on yasi's natural properties and competitiveness. Recommendations are provided to improve the functioning of the yasi value chain in both the short and long terms for yasi tree owners (i-Taukei and smallholder growers), the Fiji Ministry of Forestry, and sandalwood buyers, processors and exporters. Given its high value and non-perishability, yasi has major and near-unique potential to contribute cash income to Fijian communities in remote island archipelagos. Fiji is well placed to develop a highly competitive and sustainable yasi sandalwood industry that delivers greater returns to tree owners, growers and processors through the development of high-quality plantings, enhanced governance and chain of custody, a yasi branding strategy, the development of local value-adding, and cooperation with major perfume houses and body-care-product companies.

TI  - Economics of contracts in African food systems: evidence from the malt barley sector in Ethiopia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD ECONOMICS
AB  - Foreign direct investment (FDI) facilitates modernization of domestic agri-food systems in emerging economies through increased use of vertical coordination. This paper sheds lights on how international brewer investments in African food systems affect smallholder market participation and value chain development. In particular, we analyze the impact of contracts among malt barley producers in Ethiopia. Using cross-sectional survey data, we employ inverse probability-weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) and propensity score matching (PSM) techniques to analyze the economic impact of contracting. We find that contrary to popular belief, contracting has positive and significant impact on malt barley production, intensification, commercialization, quality improvement, and farm gate prices, ultimately resulting in increased net income and spillover into the productivity of other food crops.

TI  - Resilience of global and local value chains to the Covid-19 pandemic: Survey evidence from vegetable value chains in Senegal
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - In this paper we descriptively investigate the Covid-19 pandemic's early impact on the fruit and vegetable supply chain in Senegal, using trade statistics and survey data collected through online questionnaires and telephone interviews with smallholder farmers, agro-industrial companies, agricultural workers, traders, importers, and consumers. Our results point to major differences in how Covid-19 and containment measures disrupt supply chains between the modern export-oriented supply chain that is centered around a few large vertically integrated agro-industrial companies, and the more traditional domestic-oriented supply chain with a large number of smallholder farmers and informal traders-with the former being more resilient to the Covid-19 shock. We show that both the modern and the traditional supply chain innovate to cope with the Covid-19 containment measures. While our study is subject to some limitations, our findings bring nuance in the debate on the resilience of the food system to the pandemic, and have important policy and research implications toward international trade, social safety measures, and food and nutrition security.

TI  - Value and benefit distribution of pollination services provided by bats in the production of cactus fruits in central Mexico
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
AB  - Despite providing important ecosystem services in both natural and agricultural systems in the tropics, bats are often disregarded or considered pests; and research quantifying their importance as pollinators is scarce. We quantified the value and benefit distribution of bat pollination in the production of a major fruit crop in Mexico (pitayas, Stenocereus queretaroensis). We used exclusion experiments to quantify the effect of bat pollinators on crop yield and quality. We then used yield analysis to assess the market value of pollination services, combined with value chain analysis to assess the distribution of these economic benefits among actors. Bat pollination services to pitaya production are worth approximately US$2,500 per ha through increases in both fruit yield and size, with bats contributing around 40% of gross income across producers. Participation in the pitaya value chain provides a key seasonal source of cash income at a time of low agricultural activity, supporting livelihoods and household activities of the rural poor. However, the commercialisation of the pitaya has concentrated economic benefits with privileged groups who have access to land and markets. Our novel approach to valuing pollination services is transferable to other crops and pollinator species to demonstrate disaggregated socio-economic consequences of losing pollinators.

TI  - A systems and partnership approach to agricultural research for development Lessons from Ethiopia
T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - In spite of the availability of several improved agricultural technologies generated by the research system in Ethiopia over the last four decades, adoption of these innovations by smallholder farmers has been very low. This has led to stagnation of agricultural productivity and low crop yields, exposing the country to recurrent food shortfalls and national food insecurity. The old approach to agricultural research emphasized developing new technologies mainly through on-station research that were then supposed to reach farmers through the public-sector extension system. The Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR) has in recent years introduced a shift in agricultural research for development, which is based on the innovation systems approach that involved cultivating partnerships with several actors along the value chain, especially farmers, farmers' cooperatives and input suppliers. This paper presents the methodology used to facilitate agricultural innovations and the diffusion of new technologies and illustrates the outcomes of this initiative with regard to technology adoption, productivity growth and the market orientation of production. The authors use examples from experiences in scaling up three grain legumes. Compared to the three-year baseline average (2003-05), crop output increased nationally by 89%, 85% and 97% in 2008 for common bean, chickpea and lentil respectively. Nationally, 53-59% of the output growth is attributable to yield growth due to technological change, while the balance is due to area expansion. These results affirm that the new approach has led to accelerated adoption of new and high-yielding or low-risk varieties.

TI  - Analysis of Acacia hybrid timber value chains: A case study of woodchip and furniture production in central Vietnam
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Small-scale producers currently manage approximately half of the plantation forest area in Vietnam; and 80% of the plantation wood is processed into woodchips. To promote higher value uses of the plantation wood, the Vietnamese government has released a number of policies that aim at stimulating the domestic industry, especially the production of furniture and the development of timber value chains (VCs). This paper compares the financial and economic performance of three typical Acacia hybrid timber VCs, comprising woodchip, non-FSC furniture, and FSC-certified furniture in Thua Thien Hue province, central Vietnam. Data were collected from the interviews with 26 key informants, 30 timber producers, eight timber traders, one woodchip, and one furniture processing and exporting company. Results describe main actors in the analyzed timber VCs, their characteristics, functions, profits, and added value. The total added value is 26.3 USD/m(3) in the woodchip VC, 557.2 USD/m(3) for non-FSC furniture, and 663.7 USD/m(3) for FSC-certified furniture. Our comparative analysis also shows that the woodchip VC is financially profitable. However, regarding economic aspects, its performance is lowest, while the FSC-certified furniture VC contributes fundamentally to economic development. This research proves useful for generalization in terms of the analytical framework and the phenomenon of interactions between economic, social, and environmental aspects. The approach of transition towards high added value products, which is expressed in our paper, can further be applied in other comparable contextual cases searching for sustainable utilization of timber and forest-based products at large. A main theoretical proposition is proposed (P1) Stakeholders/VCs that face uncertainty or high competition in terms of essential resources and/or markets can enhance their financial performance through vertical and horizontal coordination.

TI  - Opportunities and Challenges of Indigenous Food Plant Farmers in Integrating into Agri-Food Value Chains in Cape Town
T2  - LAND
AB  - In many regions of the Global South, introduced crops have led to a loss of biodiversity and left the food system vulnerable to climate change. As a result, the (re-)introduction of indigenous food plants (IFPs) into agriculture is discussed as a way to a more sustainable and resilient food production, which might also be feasible for Southern small-scale garden farmers. In Cape Town (South Africa), the first attempts to commercialize IFPs of the Cape Floristic Region are currently being made. By using a value chain perspective, this study analyzes the opportunities and challenges for farmers to integrate IFPs into regional commercial agri-food chains. Based on qualitative interviews and ethnographic participant observation, we identify and explain different challenges and potentials: Challenges include the complex harvest licensing procedure and limited seed/cutting access for growers, limited capabilities and capacity of growers, the competition with subsidized conventional production and limited distribution options, as well as a negative cultural perception of IFPs and a lack of preparation knowledge at the consumption level. Further, we identified opportunities for environmental adaptation and income generation. Remarkably, our results indicated a, so far, barely discussed geographical component in the success of indigenous crops. The findings are useful for guiding relevant market development interventions and raising awareness of IFPs in Cape Town and beyond.

TI  - Assessing the Potential for Private Sector Engagement in Integrated Landscape Approaches: Insights from Value-Chain Analyses in Southern Zambia
T2  - LAND
AB  - Agricultural and forested landscapes in Africa are changing rapidly in response to socio-economic and environmental pressures. Integrated landscape approaches provide an opportunity for a more holistic and coordinated resource management strategy through the engagement of multiple stakeholders. Despite their influence as landscape actors, participation of private businesses in such initiatives has thus far been limited. This study focuses on the Kalomo District in southern Zambia, which provides an example of a rural landscape characterized by high levels of poverty, low agricultural productivity, and widespread deforestation and forest degradation. The study applied a value-chain analysis approach to better understand how the production of four locally important commodities (maize, tobacco, cattle, and charcoal) impacts land use, local livelihoods, and environmental objectives in this landscape, focusing on the role and influence of private sector actors. Data were collected through focus group discussions and key informant semi-structured interviews. Qualitative content analysis was employed to analyze the data and contextualize the findings. Results indicate three key potential entry points for increased private sector engagement: (1) improving water security for smallholders; (2) empowering small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as private sector actors; and (3) collective planning for sustainable landscape activities with deliberate measures to involve private sector actors. We discuss options for optimizing benefits from the identified entry points.

TI  - Classification of elite cassava varieties (Manihot esculenta Crantz) cultivated in Benin Republic using farmers' knowledge, morphological traits and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers
T2  - GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION
AB  - Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is an important food security crop or resource for poor rural communities particularly in Africa. The crop's ability to produce high yields even under poor conditions and storability of its roots underground for longer periods or until needed makes it a model 'food security crop'. In Benin Republic, cassava has been recognized as one of the major crop contributing towards dynamic value chains generating incomes for small-holder farmers. The crop is grown all over the country, however, the increased production are mainly recorded from far south and central parts of the country. Genetic improvement of cassava in Benin Republic is limited because of poor knowledge of genetic diversity present within the country. The main objective of this study was to assess the genetic diversity and relationships among elite cassava varieties collected from different regions of Benin using fluorescently labelled simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and to compare the results with farmer's knowledge and morphological traits. A total of 96 cultivars collected from major cassava growing areas such as Southern and Central Benin were classified into 24 different groups using farmers' knowledge, while classification based on 18 morphological traits resulted in five groups. In total, sixteen SSR markers were tested for molecular analysis of the ninety-six cassava varieties. Among the sixteen, twelve SSR markers gave good banding pattern and were used to genotype the varieties. An average of 3.58 and 0.47 for number of alleles and polymorphism information content respectively was observed. The observed heterozygosity (H-o) ranged from 0.23 to 1.0 with an average of 0.66 indicating moderate level of diversity among the cultivars. Based on the proportion of shared alleles and hierarchical clustering, the 96 elite cassava varieties were classified as 74 unique varieties. Principal component analysis and analysis of molecular variance revealed no significant variation between the regions thus, explaining regular exchange of planting materials among cassava farmers across various regions. The moderate level of genetic diversity in famer's field, revealed in the present study, is a good indication of the need for broadening the genetic base of cassava in Benin Republic and establishing a formal breeding program in the country.

TI  - Inclusiveness of contract farming along the vertical coordination continuum: Evidence from the Vietnamese rice sector
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The Vietnamese government is currently attempting to upgrade rice value chains in the Mekong River Delta by encouraging (i) vertical coordination between exporters and farmers through contract farming, and (ii) horizontal coordination among farmers through the "small farmers, large field" program. Previous studies on the determinants of contract farming participation assume that firms offer only a single contract type, whereas in reality, farmers may face a continuum of exclusive contract options. Devising correct and targeted policies for fostering contract inclusiveness hence crucially hinges on deploying correct econometric specification of the decision to participate in contract farming. We model contract farming participation and intensity in four different ways along the vertical coordination continuum: as a discrete, categorical, ordered, and continuous choice. We find that older, smaller and horizontally coordinated farmers with higher levels of trust in buyers tend to secure higher levels of buyer investment through increased vertical coordination. In contrast with the common finding in the literature that contract participation is biased towards larger farms, our findings from Vietnam suggest that the scale bias of contract farming could be successfully relaxed through horizontal coordination and even reversed under increasing levels of vertical coordination as smaller farmers are found to secure higher levels of buyer investment. These findings highlight the role both policies can play in fostering inclusiveness of contract farming in rice value chain upgrading in Vietnam.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of transactional costs on smallholder avocado farmers' participation in the export market and the extent of participation in Murang'a County, Kenya. Design/methodology/approach Data was collected from 384 avocado farmers in Murang'a County, following stratified sampling. The Heckman two-stage model was used for analysis. Findings Results showed that the cost of information search was an important variable that impedes smallholders' participation in export marketing while harvesting costs inhibits the extent of participation in export marketing. Research limitations/implications This study used data at the farm level. Therefore, insights on transaction costs among other marketing agents in the export market value chain would be an issue for future studies. Originality/value Following the debate on transaction costs and market participation among farmers in Sub-Sahara Africa, this paper models transactional costs and export market participation among avocado smallholders and measures the extent of participation with the inclusion of harvesting costs, negotiation costs, monitoring costs and information search costs that are not common in previous studies, thus contributing to the development of literature.

TI  - A comparative analysis of the influence of socioeconomic variables on the financial performance of smallholder irrigation systems in Zimbabwe
T2  - WATER INTERNATIONAL
AB  - This paper evaluates the influence of socioeconomic variables on participating in marketing cooperatives on the financial performance of small holder irrigation systems in Zimbabwe: use of credit, participation in labor groups, master farmer training, literacy, keeping of farm records, participation in savings clubs, and the gender of the plot holder Three smallholder irrigation management systems namely the government managed Agritex, the farmer managed community, and the informal bani (dambo) are compared. In the Agritex schemes, participating in labor groups is the only variable influencing financial performance. None of the variables studied are important on the community schemes, perhaps because unlike on Agritex schemes, where the government makes production decisions, community scheme farmers make their own decisions. In the bani schemes, marketing cooperatives, credit use, literacy, record keeping, and the gender of the plot holder are significant. The government should consider extending credit, developing sustainable production recommendations, and developing training programs directly applicable to the bani environment. The bani system achieves the most equitable income distribution and is more efficient than both the community and Agritex systems. The government policy of ignoring this system in development efforts directly contradicts the concepts of equity and efficiency.

TI  - Potato market access, marketing efficiency and on-farm value addition in Uganda
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB  - Understanding barriers to market access for smallholder farmers and their marketing efficiency when they participate in agricultural value chains is key to unlocking the market potential and overcoming market failures. This study aimed at determining factors limiting farmers' market access, the break-even point for undertaking postharvest value addition activities by the farmers, and the market efficiency of the Uganda potato market chains in which the smallholder farmers are participating. Our study was based on the hypothesis that market access and efficiency are higher where farmers have contract arrangements with buyers, and where they are directly linked with the buyers at the end of the value chain. The study was carried out in the popular potato growing districts of Kabale and Mbale in Uganda. The survey involved purposive selection of the study areas and random selection of potato farmers and traders. We used an Ordinary Least Square model to determine factors that influence potato smallholder farmers' market access. We also used breakeven analysis to determine the break-even point for potato farmers to take up postharvest value addition activities, and a value addition approach to determine market efficiency. Results indicate that having a contract with buyers, size of land owned, number of forked hoes owned and variety grown positively and significantly influenced farmer market access. We found that adding value to potato on farm earns farmers relatively more income. A farmer would earn 25% higher than when no value addition was done. Market chains where farmers sell to local rural traders were more efficient than selling to other alternatives. We recommend farmer involvement in value addition, collective and/or contractual marketing, and selling directly to the nearest actor in the value chain.

TI  - Post-harvest handling practices and associated food losses and limitations in the sweetpotato value chain of southern Ethiopia
T2  - NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Household food insecurity is a chronic problem in Ethiopia; the situation is being exacerbated by high population growth rates and recurring droughts in the country. The interest to address post-harvest value chain (VC) constraints leading to food losses has increased significantly to provide adequate nutrition to the growing population. In this study, mapping of sweetpotato VC not only quantifies the degree of losses but establish links between distinct VC constraints and respective food losses and limitations. Harvest and handling at farm level and shelf life issues at distribution were identified as vulnerable hot-spots of the sweetpotato food losses. Apart from physical and biological factors, demand and supply mismatch during the main harvest season at the wet markets leads to food (up to 25%) and economic losses (33-75%) followed by deficiencies in the lean season. A multi-stakeholder cooperation is required to mitigate food losses, which can have a high impact on the nutritional and financial status of the producers, market operators, and the consumers.

TI  - Quantitative risk assessment of human salmonellosis in the smallholder pig value chains in urban of Vietnam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Objectives To quantify salmonellosis risk in humans through consumption of boiled pork in urban Hung Yen Province, Vietnam, using a quantitative microbial risk assessment.
   Methods We collected 302 samples along the pork value chain in Hung Yen between April 2014 and February 2015. We developed a model in @Risk, based on microbiological, market, and household surveys on cooking, cross-contamination and consumption, and conducted sensitivity analysis.
   Results Salmonella prevalence of pen floor swabs, slaughterhouse carcasses and cut pork were 33.3, 41.7 and 44.4%, respectively. The annual incidence rate of salmonellosis in humans was estimated to be 17.7% (90% CI 0.89-45.96). Parameters with the greatest influence risk were household pork handling practice followed by prevalence in pork sold in the central market. Wide confidence interval in the incidence estimate was mainly due to the variability in the degree of reduction in bacteria concentration by cooking, and pork consumption pattern.
   Conclusions The risk of salmonellosis in humans due to boiled pork consumption appears to be high. Control measures may include improving the safety of retailed pork and improving household hygiene.

TI  - Value chain development for linking land-constrained farmers to markets: Experience from two selected villages of West Bengal, India
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Efficient use of limited landholding in farming is the key to poverty reduction and inclusive growth in the agrarian economies like India that have a large number of land-constrained farmers. It is generally suggested that cultivation of horticultural crops in dry season can increase cropping intensity and help in better use of land leading to greater livelihood opportunities and higher farm income. However, limited scale of farming, market imperfections, lack of social and human capitals and failures of policies and institutions pose several constraints to optimum use of land and hence intensification in agriculture. This paper explores if collective farming and participation in value chains can potentially enhance scale of farming by the land-constrained farmers and strengthen their market linkages. The paper is based on experiences and insights gathered through repeated engagements and focus group discussions with land-constrained farmers and other stakeholders from two selected villages under the project Promoting Socially Inclusive and Sustainable Agricultural Intensification in West Bengal and Bangladesh (SIAGI) and their nearby markets of West Bengal, India. It is found that collectivization and development of diversified value chains along with off-farm activities can strengthen market linkages of land-constrained farmers. Apart from distance, market assurance and market acceptance also influence choice of markets by the land-constrained farmers. Further, given the limited scope and associated risks of collective marketing, particularly in the absence of enough aggregation opportunities, diversified crop baskets aligned with market demand appear to be more beneficial. However, the choice between crop diversification and cluster development still remains a critical issue and, therefore, requires further scrutiny.

TI  - Postharvest Losses and their Determinants: A Challenge to Creating a Sustainable Cooking Banana Value Chain in Uganda
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Postharvest losses (PHL) result in direct food and income losses to farmers and consumers globally. PHL reduction strategies offer unique opportunities to contribute to sustainable food systems for increased food security and farm incomes for more than 200 million food insecure people in sub-Saharan Africa. Lack of empirical information remains a major challenge to operationalization of PHL reduction strategies in many countries of the region. This paper utilizes cross-sectional data to determine the extent and factors that are influencing postharvest losses in the cooking-banana value chain in Uganda. We find that 14.9% of all the cooking bananas that are produced in Uganda suffer postharvest deterioration along the value chain (7.2% of the bananas deteriorate completely and have no residual value, while 7.7% deteriorate partially and are sold at discounted prices), mostly affecting retailers. At farm level, female headed households experience more losses than those headed by males. Household headship, household size, proportion of land allocated to banana production, and monthly banana production are the principal determinants of PHL at farm level. At retail level, such losses are mainly determined by sex of the vendor and group membership. The findings call for comprehensive and gender-responsive PHL reduction strategies.

TI  - Toward territorialised dairy inclusive businesses: insights from an Egyptian case study: making dairy businesses inclusive
T2  - DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE
AB  - Building inclusive businesses with small-scale producers in the agro-food sector presents challenges, most notably in terms of governance and sustainability. These issues were explored through a Danone Egypt Ecosystem Project that sought to promote a replicable business model of milk collection centers to secure a dairy plant's sourcing while contributing to the socio-economic development of smallholders. Quality management was used to link a value chain approach and a localised agri-food system approach. The study showed that an inclusive business relying on non-inclusive coordination had limited efficiency. Decreasing power asymmetries and distances between partners seems central to ensuring sustainability.

TI  - Mobilizing farmers to stop land degradation: A different discourse from Burundi
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Stopping land degradation is one of the biggest challenges worldwide and particularly in Burundi, with its unprecedented rates of soil loss and growing food insecurity. This article proposes a different discourse onhowto engage people in stopping land degradation, and presents results and lessons learned from a bottom-up inclusive approach implemented since 2014 in Burundi: the integrated farm planning (PIP) approach. The PIP approach aims to build a solid foundation for sustainable change toward enhanced food production and good land stewardship, based on three foundation principles (motivation, stewardship, and resilience) and three guiding principles (empowerment, integration, and collaboration). This article is based on two studies undertaken in 2018: an impact study among 202 households and a qualitative study using the most significant change methodology with 30 households. Findings from both studies provide initial support that the PIP approach generates considerable changes at household, farm, and village level. Based on a vision and a plan for their farm, motivated PIP households are currently investing in the resilience of their farms and applying a diversity of conservation practices, while in all PIP villages concrete collective action is undertaken for sustainable land stewardship. Given its rapid upscaling in Burundi and the potential of the PIP approach to mobilize farmers for motivated action, the article concludes with a reflection on the core elements of a different discourse to stop land degradation.

TI  - Gender-focused analysis and opportunities for upgrading within Vietnam's smallholder pig value chains
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - Gender influences participation in food value chains (VCs) with implications for VC upgrading. This study investigated roles as well as differences in production activities, awareness, training, and attitudes between men and women in Vietnam's smallholder pig VCs. Data were gathered from a survey of 1,014 actors in different nodes along the chain, and the results showed that both men and women participated in all nodes of the VCs. Women were mainly in charge of routine husbandry activities (e.g., preparing feed, feeding animals, and cleaning pig pens) and participated in input supply (34.7%), pig production (60.2%), pork processing (63.6%), retailing (93.1%), and home preparation and cooking (100%). Men were more often responsible for tasks requiring strength, knowledge, and skills (e.g., disease management) and had greater involvement in larger-scale farming (60-80%) and slaughtering activities (98.0%). Selling of pigs was handled by both genders, but mainly men (73-80%), especially in larger farms. Likely challenges for upgrading pig VCs include limited training for producers, low concern for occupational health risks in all nodes, and misperceptions about food safety. In general, this study found no clear evidence of perceived gender inequality in the smallholder pig VCs in lowland Vietnam. Gendered upgrading in pig VCs should focus on improving women's ability to access veterinary services and animal disease management and on educating relevant VC actors about occupational health risks.

TI  - Marketing value-chain of smallholder sheep and goats in crop-livestock mixed farming system of Alaba, Southern Ethiopia
T2  - SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH
AB  - This study was conducted in Alaba district of Southern Ethiopia to describe smallholder sheep and goats marketing systems, identify marketing constraints and suggest improvement options to enhance incomes of smallholder producers. Informal and formal study tools of focused group discussion, key informant interview, household survey and rapid market appraisal were employed to gather information from development partners, smallholder farmers, traders, transporters and consumers. Smallholder farmers sale sheep and goats to fulfill immediate household cash needs, particularly to acquire food items. Smallholder producers, small and large traders, brokers, transporters and consumers are the major market participant across the market channels. Mode of marketing is mainly on 'eye-ball' basis with one-on-one price negotiation. Farmers market animals of different age, sex and weight either at farm gate or local markets, while a range of traders are involved at various stages of markets until the animals reach final consumers. Supply, demand and price of animals have clear seasonal variations. Abuse by brokers, lack of price information, access to incentive markets, poor market infrastructure and seasonality of markets are the major challenges in improving benefit and livelihood of smallholder sheep and goat producers. Commercialization of smallholder systems, standardizing marketing with marketing information and infrastructures, integrated intervention of the market channels along the value chains and market actors, formation of marketing groups and co-operatives could improve marketing efficacy and profitability of smallholder sheep and goat system.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis and Assessment of Risk Factors in Transmission of African Swine Fever Along the Major Pig Value Chain in Lao Cai Province, Vietnam
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is a contagious and lethal hemorrhagic disease with a case fatality rate approaching 100% in domestic pigs. The main objectives of this study were to describe the spatiotemporal analysis as well as to assess the potential risk factors along the pig value chain in Lao Cai province, Vietnam. A total of 925 outbreaks were reported from 2019 to 2020. The three clusters (primary, secondary and 5th) were observed near the Chinese border. The most temporal clusters were detected between May and August during the study period. In addition, we evaluated the association between ASF outbreak locations to the nearest main roads and elevation. For ASF outbreak locations to the nearest main roads, compared with the reference (<5,000 m), <1,000 m (10.22 times) and 1,000-2,000 m (1.98 times) were significantly higher occurrences of ASF. For elevation, compared to the reference (>1,500 m), the farm locations with <500 m (55.31 times) showed a significantly increased risk of ASF outbreaks. Farmers perceived that the highest risk of ASF transmission may come from collectors and slaughterers, intermediaries inside and outside the commune, feed agents and maize agents in the commune, and pig retailers. Both commercial and household pig producers considered minimizing the number of people going in and out of pig stables and improving healthcare and husbandry procedures to be both very important and feasible. There is a need for compliance by all pig producers and other actors in the pig value chain to adopt biosecurity practices. Therefore, awareness, knowledge and understanding of infection and risks of ASF need to be improved. Veterinary officials at the provincial and district levels need to improve capacity and resources to perform laboratory analysis for ASF and need to coordinate with local actors on the control and prevention of ASF in the community.

TI  - Performance of organic farming in developing countries: a case of organic tomato value chain in Lebanon
T2  - RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - The future of food value chains has increasingly been reliant on the wider adoption of sustainable farming practices that include organic agriculture. Organic farming in developed countries is standardized and occupies a niche in agro-food systems. However, such a standard model, when transferred to developing countries, faces difficulty in implementation. This study aims to investigate the factors affecting the expansion of organic agriculture in Lebanon, a Middle Eastern context, and analyzes the economic performance of organic tomato among smallholder farmers. Accordingly, the study was able to determine the production costs, map the organic value chain and assess the profitability of organic tomato by comparing it with the conventional tomato in the same value chain. The study finds organic farming being increasingly expensive primarily due to the inherently high cost of production in Lebanon and the inefficient organization of the organic value chain. As a result, we suggest a blended approach of organic farming with other models, in particular agro-tourism, as a local solution to the sustainability of organic farming in developing countries with limited resources (land and labor) and characterized by long marketing channels. In countries such as Lebanon, a country endowed with rich cultural heritage and natural and beautiful landscapes, the agro-tourism model can harness organic farming and tourism activities. We also propose the adoption of local collective guarantee systems for organic production as a way to alleviate the costs of third-party auditing in Lebanon.

TI  - Smallholders at a Crossroad: Intensify or Fall behind? Exploring Alternative Livelihood Strategies in a Globalized World
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The chocolate market is experiencing a wave of market differentiation thanks to the emergence of the bean-to-bar movement. Cacao is seeing both a rise in demand for mass markets and a process of market bifurcation into more specialized, high-quality products for wealthy urban consumers. For the specialized market, the quality and origin of the beans are important attributes. Direct trading between chocolate makers and famers seeks to promote the conservation of rare cultivars and traditional agroforestry systems, while lifting farmers out of poverty. Here we assess whether these alternative configurations of the global value chain truly offer smallholders new opportunities, beyond the traditional intensification or marginalization pathways that are generally offered to them. We conducted detailed socio-economic and biophysical surveys with a sample of farms in three of the largest cacao producing provinces of Ecuador. Our results show that, even though smallholders lack the assets needed to join mainstream commodity markets, they have been able to capitalize on the qualities of their traditional varieties to access niche markets. Through strong cooperatives, the knowledge held by buyers about what constitutes a high-quality bean has been transferred to farmers. A unique natural capital may provide smallholders with rewarding pathways to develop their agriculture, exploiting new market opportunities offered by globalization.

TI  - Agricultural investment and international land deals: evidence from a multi-country study in Africa
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Recent spikes in world food and energy prices have fostered renewed momentum for agricultural investment in lower and middle-income countries. Governments in some food-importing countries are promoting the acquisition of land overseas as a means to ensure long-term national food security. Businesses are recognizing new opportunities for strong returns from international investments in agriculture for food, fuel and other agricultural commodities. Dubbed 'land grabs' in the media, land-based investments have kindled much international debate, in which strong positions are taken on the impacts of such investments on environment, rights, sovereignty, livelihoods, development and conflict at local, national and international levels. Depending on how they are structured, agricultural investments may deliver local benefits and include small-scale producers in value chains, or carry environmental and social risks that fall disproportionately on local people. Vigorous public debate in recipient countries, effective screening of proposed investments, including robust environmental and social impact assessments, secure local land and resource rights, local voice in decision-making, skillfully negotiated and regulated contracts and effective policy incentives for business models that favor working with local farmers over large plantations can help make the renewed momentum in agricultural investment work for development.

TI  - Food Loss-Reducing Intervention Strategies for Potato Smallholders in Kenya-A Positive Business Case with Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - This paper is focused on intervention scenarios for smallholder potato value chains in Kenya that improve yields, reduce losses, minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase economic performance and food security. For that, business models and GHG emission estimates are developed, based on the existing data, combined with relevancy and time-to-impact analysis using practical real-life information from stakeholders in the potato sector, which is the second largest agricultural crop in Kenya after maize. The results show that profitability, environmental improvement and food security can go hand in hand with realistic short-term interventions for potato production at smallholder farms.

TI  - Fair trade governance and diversification: The experience of the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - This paper provides an empirical contribution to the theoretical debate concerning the impact of fair trade governance on the essential development processes of diversification and value chain upgrading. Two main positions currently shape this debate: one that argues the payment of 'above market' prices will promote reliance by Southern producers on low value agricultural production: another that fair trade might actually alleviate barriers to diversification and facilitate export opportunities. Responding to a lack of empirically grounded literature, the paper focuses on involvement by the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi (NASFAM) with two dedicated fair trade marketing networks. Based on qualitative case study research, analysis shows that dedicated fair trade organisations have played a significant role in promoting export diversification: particularly through the facilitation of market access and provision of the financial, social and physical capital needed to support such changes. Beyond this however, the study also highlights the importance and limitations of 'moral geographies' that permeate the construction of ethical credentials beneficial to the international marketing of Southern export producers in Northern consumer markets.

TI  - The "quiet revolution" in the aquaculture value chain in Bangladesh
T2  - AQUACULTURE
AB  - The study has produced a single, powerful finding: the fish value chain in Bangladesh is growing and transforming very rapidly, in all segments. (1) The quiet revolution in the fish value chain is a domestic market revolution: 94% of aquaculture production is destined for domestic consumption. (2) The farmed fish market grew by a factor of 25 times in three decades to nearly 2 million tons today. At most 10% of farmed fish are home-consumed, the rest are marketed. 42% of marketed farmed fish is consumed in urban areas and that share is growing fast (3) There has been a tripling of volumes and actors in all the segments of the value chain over the past decade. (4) There has been rapid capital deepening in the form of investments by hundreds of thousands of actors in the fish value chain; apparent in a great jump in feed use, investment in equipment and pond construction, and investments in mills, hatcheries and vehicles. These investments have been made by, and provided opportunities for, a multitude of smallholder farmers and small and medium enterprises throughout the chain. (5) There has been diversification and specialization beyond carps into production of commercial species such as tilapia and pangasius catfish, which have raised yields and helped to move the fisheries sector along the "product cycle." (6) So far the quiet revolution is driven by increase in demand, improvement in infrastructure, and investments by small-scale actors apart from large feed mills. Very little change is due to imposition of standards and contracts, or NGO or government action (except initial government support at the earliest stages in the 1980s). The most important policy has been infrastructure investment, good business environment, and laissez faire policy in terms of crop choice of farmers.
   Statement of relevance: This study focuses on the transformation of aquaculture in Bangladesh, a dynamic sector that has been driven by investments of hundreds of thousands of mainly small actors in the fish value chain. Investments that have bolstered the diversification beyond the production of carps, into production of new commercial species, raising yields and then reducing the price of consumed fish over time.

TI  - Effective Mainstreaming of Agricultural Emissions into Climate Action Agenda: The Case of Institutions and Smallholder Dairy Production Systems, Western Kenya
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
AB  - Small-scale farming production systems are integral drivers of global sustainability challenges and the climate crisis as well as a solution space for the transition to climate compatible development. However, mainstreaming agricultural emissions into a climate action agenda through integrative approaches, such as Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA), largely reinforces adaptation-mitigation dualism and pays inadequate attention to institutions' linkage on the generation of externalities, such as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. This may undermine the effectiveness of local-global climate risk management initiatives. Literature data and a survey of small-scale farmers' dairy feeding strategies were used in the simulation of GHG emissions. The effect of price risks on ecoefficiencies or the amount of GHG emissions per unit of produced milk is framed as a proxy for institutional feedbacks on GHG emissions and effect at scale. This case study on small-scale dairy farmers in western Kenya illustrates the effect of local-level and sectoral-level institutional constraints, such as market risks on decision making, on GHG emissions and the effectiveness of climate action. The findings suggest that price risks are significant in incentivising the adoption of CSA technologies. Since institutional interactions influence the choice of individual farmer management actions in adaptation planning, they significantly contribute to GHG spillover at scale. This can be visualised in terms of the nexus between low or non-existent dairy feeding strategies, low herd productivity, and net higher methane emissions per unit of produced milk in a dairy value chain. The use of the Sustainable Food Value Chain (SFVC) analytical lens could mediate the identification of binding constraints, foster organisational and policy coherence, as well as broker the effective mainstreaming of agricultural emissions into local-global climate change risk management initiatives. Market risks thus provide a systematic and holistic lens for assessing alternative carbon transitions, climate financing, adaptation-mitigation dualism, and the related risk of maladaptation, all of which are integral in the planning and implementation of effective climate action initiatives.

TI  - Fish consumption pathways and food security in an Indonesian fishing community
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Coastal communities in Indonesia are often prone to food insecurity because they are highly dependent on fisheries for income and subsistence. However, connections between fish and food security have received limited attention in the national fisheries discourse; Indonesian fisheries are managed according to production-based indicators, despite the important roles that access and distribution play in mediating how fish are used and valued. Combining value chain analysis (VCA) and a "fish as food" framework, we administer survey interviews to members of a small Indonesian fishing community regarding species catch, on-island exchange of fish, and the role of fish species in the broader diet. Our mixed-methods approach and data aim to characterize links between fish harvest and consumption. Two questions guide the research: i) How do the island's fisheries influence access to fish for household consumption? ii) What defines fish dependency in this community? Our findings indicate that island harvest and consumption are dominated by small pelagic species caught by commercial crews; however, small-scale fishers play a key role in providing fish during low catch periods. Catch and consumption are seasonally dependent: households reduce their fish consumption and substitute for less preferred farmed (milk)fish during windy seasons. Evidence of market-based fish trade and strong associations between dietary diversity and non-fish food groups suggest that food security in this community is more related to income from fishing than direct consumption of fish. To address the food security implications of fisheries management, there is a need for coordination among fisheries and public health sectors.

TI  - Dynamics of smallholder participation in horticultural export chains: evidence from Ecuador
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We study the dynamics of smallholder participation in export value chains focusing on the example of small-scale broccoli producers in the highlands of Ecuador. Combining cross-sectional data from a household survey with 11-year longitudinal data on export market transactions, we explain the hazards of dropping out of a high-value export chain. We apply a multispell cox duration model that allows us to consider multiple entries and exits from the supply chain. We also provide evidence on the welfare impacts associated with participation. The results suggest that small-scale farmers' exit from the export sector is accelerated by high transaction risks experienced in the past. While we find no particular evidence for the exclusion of small-scale farmers from the export sector, we do find that poorer households and female-headed households tend to drop out faster, especially as long as the sector is still prospering. Finally, when considering welfare effects, we do not find evidence that participation translates into tangible benefits for broccoli farmers. We discuss some measures that could help improve the long-term sustainability of smallholder integration in high-value chains.

TI  - Benefit-Cost Analysis of Foot and Mouth Disease Control in Large Ruminants in Cambodia
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in Cambodia and throughout the Greater Mekong Subregion and causes significant losses to rural smallholders owning the majority of the national large ruminant population. However, due to underreporting, paucity of knowledge of FMD impacts, limited veterinary capacity and deficits of data available for analysis, the quantifiable benefits of a national FMD control programme are unknown. To address this deficit, existing literature and research data from the 'Best practice health and husbandry of cattle, Cambodia' project conducted between 2007 and 2012, were used to develop a threephase analysis framework to: assess the impacts of the recent widespread FMD epizootic in Cambodia in 2010, conduct a value chain analysis of the large ruminant market and estimate the costs and benefits for a national large ruminant biannual FMD vaccination programme. A trader survey conducted in 2010-2011 provided cattle and buffalo value chain information and was matched to village herd structure data to calculate a total large ruminant farm-gate value of USD 1.271 billion in 2010. Monte Carlo simulation modelling that implemented a 5-year biannual vaccination programme at a cost of USD 6.3 an animal per year identified a benefit-cost ratio of 1.40 (95% CI 0.96-2.20) when accounting for recent prices of cattle and buffalo in Cambodia and based on an expected annual incidence of 0.2 (assuming one major epizootic in the 5-year vaccination programme). Given that the majority of the large ruminants are owned by rural smallholders, and mostly the poor are involved in agricultural employment, the successful implementation of an FMD control programme in Cambodia would be expected to avoid estimated losses of USD 135 million; equivalent to 10.6% of the 2010 farm-gate value and contributing to important reductions in rural poverty and food insecurity.

TI  - Making a bridge between livelihoods and forest conservation: Lessons from non timber forest products' utilization in South Sumatera, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Promoting forest conservation as well as the well-being of forest proximate people requires an appropriate balance of regulation, enforcement, and incentives. When regulation and enforcement are minimal, economic incentives for low-intensity and non-deleterious forest use can provide conservation and livelihood benefits. One management option for promoting low intensity and non-deleterious forest use includes the harvest and production of non-timber forest products (NTFPs). This research identifies and examines strategies to promote sustainable livelihoods in a conservation landscape. We assess Pangkalan Bulian Village, Musi Banyuasin District, South Sumatra Province using the Community Livelihood Appraisal and Product Scanning (CLAPS) method to describe potential commodities and conduct value chain and market analyses on downstream sectors. Data collection included in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and household surveys disseminated through snowball sampling. We find that rattan is a priority NTFP due to the presence of abundant raw materials, trained human resources, and potential markets. Actors involved along the value chain are collectors, local brokers, large collectors, small processors, large processors, retailers and end consumers. Profit margins earned along each link of the value chain are around 25%. Thus, we encourage rattan harvest and production as a low intensity and non-deleterious forest use that can simultaneously benefit local livelihoods and forest conservation in a landscape where protected area rules and regulations are difficult to enforce.

TI  - A behavior change communication intervention, but not livelihood interventions, improves diet diversity and animal-source food consumption among Ghanaian women
T2  - FOOD & NUTRITION RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Women of reproductive age (WRA), especially in sub-Saharan Africa, are vulnerable to micro-nutrient deficiencies driven largely by poor quality diets. Intervening into food value chains, on which many households in low- and middle-income countries depend for their livelihood, may be a promising approach to improving diets in these contexts.
   Objective: In this pilot-scale randomized trial, we evaluated whether a multisectoral, food value chain intervention improved the diet diversity and the consumption of animal-source foods (ASFs) among WRA in Ghana.
   Design: Twelve fish-smoking communities in two regions of Ghana with 296 eligible women were randomly assigned to one of three 9-month treatment arms: 1) behavior change communication (BCC) to promote improved diet quality through twice-weekly audio messages and bi-weekly peer-to-peer learning sessions; 2) BCC with microcredit to increase women's incomes; or 3) BCC with provision of new smoke-oven technology. We assessed baseline-endline and between-treatment arm differences using a 10-lbod group diet diversity score (DDS), the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W) indicator, and 7-day frequency of ASF consumption.
   Results: Among 118 participants (39 in both treatment arm 1 and treatment arm 3, and 40 in treatment arm 2, with no participant refusals), DDS increased from a mean (SD) of 4.0 (1.3) at baseline to 5.1 (0.9) at endline (P-value < 0.0001). The proportion of women achieving the MDD-W indicator nearly doubled from baseline (35.6%) to endline (69.5%) (P-value < 0.0001). Frequency of ASF consumption similarly increased for meat and poultry (2.7 (4.1) to 4.7 (5.3); P-value < 0.0001) and eggs (1.5 (3.1) to 2.3 (4.9); P-value = 0.02). Few differences in these outcomes were observed among treatment arms.
   Conclusions: A BCC intervention improved diet diversity and consumption of ASFs among participants. However, neither a group-based microcredit nor improved smoke oven intervention, both of which increased women's income, led to additional dietary improvements.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF COOPERATIVE PATRONAGE: THE CASE OF NATIONAL SMALL HOLDER FARMERS' ASSOCIATION (NASFAM) OF MALAWI IN KASUNGU DISTRICT
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - This paper analyses the impact of individual farmers' participation in the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi (NASFAM). Precisely the paper analyses the effect of participation on credit market access, fertilizer use and total incomes of its participants in the Kasungu district of Malawi. NASFAM is a form of producer cooperative with a number of socio-economic functions. Using data on income per capita, fertilizer expenditure and access to credit, this paper tests the hypothesis that participation in NASFAM positively impacted incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition. Employing Propensity Score Matching methodology to estimate Average Treatment Effects (ATT) on programme members, this paper finds evidence that participation in NASFAM had a positive effect on all the endogenous variables. Membership enhances household level incomes, fertilizer use and credit acquisition and is hence in line with national goals of poverty reduction, the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) principles, the SADC's Regional Indicative Strategy Development Plan (RISDP) and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Based on these findings and the fact that credit and fertilizer access are still problematic in Malawi's rural areas, it appears that there is great need for NASFAM to expand to areas where it currently does not have activities. Such expansion would ensure food security over a wider range of rural households through improved input access.

TI  - Sunflower Value Chain Enhancements for the Rural Economy in Tanzania: A Village Computable General Equilibrium-CGE Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Poverty is prevalent and widespread in rural Tanzania, where agriculture is the main activity. The government is making significant public investments intended to speed the growth of agriculture as a means to accelerate inclusive economic growth. In line with public investments, the government is promoting public-private partnerships by encouraging the use of improved agricultural innovations and linking farmers to markets, seeking to increase their yields and income. However, there is a paucity of empirical evidence using multipliers analysis about the extent of how gains in agricultural productivity and market linkages for farmers in rural areas help improve the economy at the household level. This paper assesses the welfare effects of the sunflower value chain for a rural economy in Tanzania using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for the selected village, which has a high potential for sunflower. Findings highlight the use of the CGE model, first, for analyzing and understanding the economic sectors at a village level. Second, the effects of various upgrading strategies promoted for improving rural farming communities by the government and non-governmental development partners at the micro-scale are analyzed and potential agricultural commodity value chains identified. The multiplier analysis provided insights regarding the potential of sunflower crops for the village economy.

TI  - Strategies to Upgrade Animal Health Delivery in Village Poultry Systems: Perspectives of Stakeholders From Northern Ghana and Central Zones in Tanzania
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - Village chicken production holds much potential for the alleviation of malnutrition and poverty in rural communities in Africa. Owing to their subsistence nature, however, such systems are rife with infectious poultry diseases such as Newcastle disease (ND). Strategies common for the management of ND and other poultry diseases in intensive production systems, including vaccination and biosecurity measures, have seen limited success in the village production systems. New approaches are needed that can successfully deliver animal health inputs and services for the effective management of poultry health challenges in low-input systems. Our study utilized focus group discussions with men and women farmers as well as other poultry value chain actors such as input suppliers, live bird traders and processed poultry meat retailers, to investigate potential options for delivery of animal health care to village poultry systems in northern Ghana and central Tanzania. ND was commonly reported as a major disease constraint in the study sites of the two countries, with resulting fatalities particularly impactful on men and women producers and on traders. We therefore also conducted interviews that focused specifically on the gender component of village chicken production. The key health related challenges prioritized by women and men participants included limited access to, and poor quality of, vaccines and veterinary drugs, a shortage of veterinary officers, and insufficient knowledge and training of farmers on flock management practices. Women, more than men, emphasized the difficulties of accessing poultry health services. Our assessments suggest that for poultry health care delivery in the studied communities to be effective, there is need to improve the supply of good quality drugs and vaccines in rural areas, respond to the needs of both men and women, and recognize the different incentives for farmers, traders and other value chain actors. Community-based approaches and increased use of ICT technology such as mobile phones have much to offer in this regard.

TI  - Sanitation value chains in low density settings in Indonesia and Vietnam: impetus for a rethink to achieve pro-poor outcomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study examined the sanitation hardware supply chain in rural, low density settings in Indonesia and Vietnam. Actual costs along the chains were investigated to understand the challenges and opportunities to support affordable sanitation in remote, rural locations. Data were collected from four remote districts in Indonesia and Vietnam through a systematic value-chain analysis comprising 378 interviews across households and supply chain actors and both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Three main findings are presented. Firstly, poor households, often located in remote areas and with lower sanitation access, often experienced higher costs to build durable latrines than households in accessible areas or district capitals. Second, locally sourced materials (sand, bricks or gravel) had a greater influence on price than externally sourced materials (cement, steel and toilet pans), even accounting for cost increases of these materials along the supply chain. Thirdly, transport and labour costs represented considerable proportions of the overall cost to build a toilet. These findings highlighted logistical and financial barriers to poor, remote households in accessing sanitation. Findings can inform strategies to improve the availability and affordability of sanitation products and services, in particular key issues that need to be addressed through government and non-government pro-poor market-based interventions.

TI  - Maximizing the contribution of irrigated agriculture to poverty alleviation The case of smallholder cabbage producers from the Zanyokwe Irrigation Scheme
T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - This paper investigates the water use and marketing behaviour of smallholder cabbage producers from the Zanyokwe Irrigation Scheme in South Africa to identify the behaviour associated with the highest financial returns to water allocated to smallholder farmers to decrease rural poverty. The blue water footprint for cabbages was estimated; the value of the water was then calculated as the gross margin and value added per cubic metre of water at the respective stages along the value chain. The analyses show that the attributes of the products have a major influence on the degree of access to the highest value market alternatives, and hence on the ability of smallholder farmers to generate the highest possible return from the water they receive for agricultural purposes.

TI  - Governing sustainable palm oil supply: Disconnects, complementarities, and antagonisms between state regulations and private standards
T2  - REGULATION & GOVERNANCE
AB  - The global palm oil value chain has grown in complexity; stakeholder relationships and linkages are increasingly shaped by new public and private standards that aim to ameliorate social and environmental costs while harnessing economic gains. Regulatory initiatives in the emerging policy regime complex struggle to resolve sector-wide structural performance issues: pervasive land conflicts, yield differences between companies and smallholders, and carbon emissions arising from deforestation and peatland conversion. Identifying opportunities for more effective governance of the palm oil value chain and supply landscapes, this paper explores disconnects, complementarities, and antagonisms between public regulations and private standards, looking at the global, national, and subnational policy domains shaping chain actors' conduct. Greater complementarities have emerged among transnational instruments, but state regulation disconnects persist and antagonisms prevail between national state regulations and transnational private standards. Emerging experimental approaches, particularly at subnational level, aim to improve coordination to both enhance complementarities and resolve disconnects.

TI  - Improving diets and nutrition through an integrated poultry value chain and nutrition intervention (SELEVER) in Burkina Faso: study protocol for a randomized trial
T2  - TRIALS
AB  - Background: The SELEVER study is designed to evaluate the impact of an integrated agriculture-nutrition package of interventions (including poultry value chain development, women's empowerment activities, and a behavior change communications strategy to promote improved diets and feeding, care, and hygiene practices) on the diets, health, and nutritional status of women and children in Burkina Faso. This paper presents the rationale and study design.
   Methods: The impact evaluation involves a cluster randomized controlled trial design that will be implemented in 120 rural communities/villages within 60 communes supported by SELEVER in the Boucle de Mouhoun, Centre-Ouest, and Haut-Bassins regions of Burkina Faso. Communities will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms, including: (1) SELEVER intervention group; (2) SELEVER with an intensive WASH component; and (3) control group without intervention. Primary outcomes include the mean probability of adequacy of diets for women and children (aged 2-4 years at baseline), infant and young child feeding practices of caregivers of children aged 0-2 years, and household poultry production and sales. Intermediate outcomes along the agriculture and nutrition pathways will also be measured, including child nutrition status and development. The evaluation will follow a mixed-methods approach, including a panel of child-, household-, community-, and market-level surveys, and data collection points during post-harvest and lean seasons, as well as one year after implementation completion to examine sustainability.
   Discussion: To our knowledge, this study is the first to rigorously examine from a food systems perspective, the simultaneous impact of scaling-up nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions through a livestock value-chain and community-intervention platform, across nutrition, health, and agriculture domains. The findings of this evaluation will provide evidence to support the design of market-based nutrition-sensitive interventions.

TI  - Farmer groups, collective marketing and smallholder farm performance in rural Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose Rapid transformation of agrifood value chains because of population growth, urbanization, rising consumer incomes and increased demand for food quality and safety has resulted in the need for smallholder farmers to coordinate horizontally through group formation and collective marketing to improve farm performance in developing countries. This paper aims to examine the factors that influence farmer group membership and collective marketing decisions and their impacts on smallholder farm performance in rural Ghana. Design/methodology/approach Using data from a recent survey of 447 rice farmers in rural Ghana, an endogenous switching regression model is employed to account for selection bias arising from both observable and unobservable farmer attributes. Findings The data reveal that group members and collective marketing participants obtained higher prices and also incurred lower input costs. The econometric estimates show that age, access to credit, mobile phone ownership, distance to market and road status are the main drivers of group membership and collective marketing decisions. The authors also find positive and significant impacts of farmer group membership and collective marketing on farm net revenues. Research limitations/implications The findings from this study suggest that government and donor support for the formation of farmer groups during implementation of agriculture and value chain interventions should as well incorporate strategies to facilitate collective marketing. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to examine the role farmer groups and collective marketing play in improving smallholder farm performance.

TI  - Prices, specialty varieties, and postharvest practices: Insights from cacao value chains in Ecuador
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - Efforts to improve cacao value chains often assume that production of fine and flavor varieties will raise smallholder incomes. Undertaking postharvest practices of fermentation and drying is another exercise assumed to increase value-added capture by smallholder producers. This study employs household data from 340 cacao farms in 15 villages in coastal Ecuador during 2018 to empirically assess these assumptions. Contrary to the common belief of the international development community, we find that the production of fine and flavor cacao varieties has no association with the price received by small-scale producers. This is mainly due to (i) low productivity and (ii) nonexistent price premiums. Findings also suggest that the use of postharvest practices of fermentation and drying may lead to substantial price responses irrespective of the type of variety grown. The results presented here have implications for program interventions aimed at increasing farmer revenue. Programs promoting the use of fine and flavor varieties alone might be misguided and can be improved by training in modern processing techniques, regardless of the variety produced.

TI  - Socio-economic factors influencing smallholder farmers' decision to participate in agro-processing industry in Gauteng province, South Africa
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - Smallholder farmers in South Africa have not been linked successfully to sustainable agro-processing value chains. This study aimed to identify factors influencing smallholder farmers' decision to participate in the agro-processing industry, as well as the extent of their participation in the Gauteng Province. Data was collected through a structured questionnaire that was administered face-to-face to respondents in a randomly purposive selected sample of 102 smallholder farmers. A double-hurdle model was used to analyse factors influencing the decision to participate and the level of participation in agro-processing. The results show that very few (19%) smallholder farmers participate in the agro-processing industry of the Gauteng Province. The results also revealed that factors such as educational level, land tenure, agro-processing training and information have a positive influence on the decision to participate. Distance to market and off-farm income negatively influence the decision to participate. The level of participation is influenced by socio-economic factors such as age, household size, level of education, grain and livestock producers, farm size and access to training. The study recommends that smallholder agro-processing policy instruments be adjusted to facilitate effective participation in the agro-processing industry and participation in other high market value chains. There is a need to build up local agro-processing plants as a strategy of lowering the costs of transportation and storage when farmers take their farm produce to distant manufacturers or processors.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF YOUTHS PARTICIPATION IN CASSAVA PRODUCTION UNDER THE VALUE CHAIN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (VCDP) IN BIDA LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF NIGER STATE, NIGERIA
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The study was carried out to assess youths participation in cassava production under value chain development programme (VCDP) in Bida local Government Area of Niger State, Nigeria, with the specific objectives of describing the socio-economic characteristics of the VCDP participants, costs and returns, level of youths participation and factors influencing youth participation in the VCDP. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 100 young cassava farmers and data collected were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics and probit regression analysis. The level of profitability was measured using gross margin and net farm income analysis. The results obtained shows that farmers in the study area had low formal education and were mostly married males with an average age and household size of 32 years and six (6) persons respectively. The gross margin and net farm income were (sic)109,050.00 and (sic)103,450.00 per hectare, respectively. The level of youths ' participation under the VCDP was moderate and this was influenced by their age, gender, level of education, marital status, household size, farming occupation and cooperative membership. The major constraints faced by the farmers includes: poor extension agents/farmers' ratio, inadequate capital and lack of market linkage. To this end, it was recommended that change agents should enlighten farmers on the benefit of VCDP and functional cooperative that could facilitate credit and group dynamism.

TI  - The use of innovation uptake in identification of business models in the Indonesian smallholder cattle value chain
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to guide commercial and policy action to improve smallholder Indonesian cattle systems.Design/methodology/approachA survey (n = 304) of smallholder cattle farms in six villages in two districts of Nusa Tenggara Barat, Indonesia. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) were employed to classify cattle farms into business models according to observed innovation. Differences between business models were identified using a one-way-analysis-of-variance (ANOVA).FindingsFour business models were identified, representing profiles of innovation adoption and elements of business models, socio-economic characteristics, farming system and performance variables including revenue, cost and profit. The business models display a range of orientation to buyer requirements and a range of approaches to production, indicating a need to promote in a variety of ways the change from supply-push to demand-pull in the cattle value chain.Research limitations/implicationsThis study offers guidance on how business models might be strengthened over time, by using simple indicators of performance and the models' linkage to innovation in the context of each business model. The business models developed here, and refinements to them based on localised conditions, offer a targeted and accelerated pathway to improved performance in smallholder systems.Originality/valueThis study proposed a novel approach to the recognition of business models based on innovation.

TI  - Smallholders' perceptions and preferences for market attributes promoting sustained participation in modern agricultural value chains
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Connecting smallholder farmers to modern agricultural value chains (henceforth high-value markets [HVMs]) represents a credible pathway to improving the welfare of farmers in developing countries. Smallholder exit rates from HVMs remains high, raising concerns about their sustained participation of smallholders in HVMs. We conduct a Best-Worst Scaling choice experiment with horticultural farmers in Kenya to understand their perceptions and preferences for market attributes that could promote sustained participation in HVMs. A unique feature of our study examines smallholders' best or worst choice consistency as means to further understand their thought process. Our results reveal that smallholders mostly expressed preference for a flexible incentive-based pricing option and long-term formal relationships with their buyers. Delayed payments and high investment requirements were the worst market attributes chosen by smallholders. Preference heterogeneity was driven by the farming experience, gender, income and location of the farmers. We find that smallholders are well aware of conditions that might motivate exit from HVMs relative to conditions that facilitate participation in HVMs. Our findings demonstrate the relevance of various key market attributes central to participation in HVMs, while teasing out the various coordination roles cooperatives, non-governmental organisations can play in facilitating sustained smallholder participation in HVMs.

TI  - Organic certification for shrimp value chains in Ca Mau, Vietnam: a means for improvement or an end in itself?
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Eco-certification has been used as a tool to mitigate adverse effects of aquaculture production and might thus be understood as a private approach to sustainable ecosystem management. In production forests in Ca Mau, Vietnam, where mangrove have suffered degradation despite legal protection, different projects have targeted reversing this trend by means of private certification using the 'Naturland' organic standard as a reference. So far the outcomes have, however, been proven unsatisfactory. With the aim to better understand the reasons for these poor outcomes, a survey of forty households was conducted in a production forest in Rach Goc commune, Ngoc Hien District. We evaluated farmers' perceptions on mangrove management, the drivers guiding shrimp farming, and whether there was a difference between participants and non-participants in a former 'Naturland' organic project. To complement the survey, a range of stakeholders involved in shrimp value chains were interviewed to better understand the terms and benefits of certification. The results of this survey suggested that, when applied to shrimp-mangrove farming systems in production forests in Ca Mau, 'eco-certification' and associated benefits are not very satisfactory. The survey results revealed that certified farms do not show significant differences to non-certified farms in terms of social and environmental benefits. As far as the implementation process was concerned, the survey results showed that a failure to integrate local farmers as participants consequently resulted in households becoming 'objects' for certification and not project partners with equal weight and power. It appears that rather than being a tool for improvement, 'Naturland' certification for shrimp-mangrove farming systems in Ca Mau's production forests has become an end in itself.

TI  - Winner-takes-all no more: radical transparency for sustainable specialty coffee value chains
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The paper aims to understand the role of sensory quality scoring used at the competition auctions on pricing outcomes and how the auction process could be improved to increase sustainability in the specialty coffee market. Design/methodology/approach The authors build a conceptual model explaining the potential role of sensory quality scoring in generating inequitable outcomes in specialty coffee auctions. The authors' research is exploratory. The authors base the propositions on the findings of the extant literature and our analysis of data from 24 Best of Panama (BOP) Auctions that took place between 2017 and 2021. Findings A striking feature in recent BOP Auctions is a winner-takes-all (WTA) outcome. The authors also document the presence of significant price inversion. The authors attribute these outcomes to the interactions of information-poor producers, information-rich intermediaries and conspicuous consumers in competition auctions, where the product quality measurement is highly unreliable. Research limitations/implications Data need to be gathered more broadly to enable the operationalization of the current propositions into testable hypotheses. Social implications These strategies intend to provide guidelines for producers, consumers and other value chain participants on creating equitable solutions to a thriving industry where a WTA phenomenon occurs. Originality/value The current study is the first to argue that existing quality scoring practices, as well as conspicuous consumption, contribute to the inequities. Finally, the study proposes novel interventions to standardize the quality grading protocols and communicate them transparently to both producers and consumers.

TI  - The identity of palm oil smallholders' cooperative in Malaysia: A preliminary descriptive
T2  - GEOGRAFIA-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY & SPACE
AB  - Cooperatives are entities that established to achieve the goals of homogeneous members. Generally, a cooperative aim to protect the well-being of its members. But in line with the current development, a cooperative entity is also facing a new environment that could potentially affect its identity. In addition, contextual factors have the potential to create certain patterns in operationalizing cooperative concepts. This paper aims at describing the identity characteristics of oil palm smallholder cooperatives in Malaysia. This study employed interview techniques with six cooperatives in the states of Selangor, Perak and Johor. The findings of this study show that oil palm cooperatives belong to both farmers and settlers and also their second generations. The cooperative has the structure of a Cooperative Board Member selected from the members of the cooperative and has the autonomy in decision-making without external intervention. The services offered are likely to be towards a "safe" and "low risk" business portfolio. However, the cooperative of smallholders shown a pattern of expanding business portfolios that is no longer focused on investment or passive activities. The oil palm smallholders' cooperatives are increasingly becoming more involved in more productive yields. However, the overall entrepreneurial orientation reflects a consistent trend that offer services with conservative and cautious pattern.

TI  - Can a public GAP approach ensure safety and fairness? A comparative study of Q-GAP in Thailand
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - Since the early 2000s, the governments in ASEAN (the Association of South East Asian Nations) countries have developed good agricultural practices' (GAP) as public approaches to field-level quality assurance. Besides the primary goals of consumer food safety and quality assurance, these public GAP programs aim to support small-scale farmer inclusion in mainstream markets. This goal represents the antithesis of the prevailing trend that private GAP approaches have tightened integration with resourceful, large-scale producers in global value chains. This paper examines the compatibility of the goals of safety assurance and social justice in a public GAP approach through comparative analysis of Thailand's Q-GAP between two local contexts of fruit production and marketing. The research findings suggest that while the public GAP scheme could draw the participation of a broad cohort of local small-scale producers and serve to certify their production, its impact on changing producers' on-field practices and catalyzing their access to the global market through food safety assurance is limited. The binding factors include the lack of producers' understanding of the principles of the programme, limited additional economic merits for them, and the influence of extra-local market forces that stress economies of size and food quality rather than food safety.

TI  - Emerging, and old, dilemmas for food security in Latin America
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
AB  - The present text offers a summary of some of the crucial food security problems in Latin American (LA) countries. This region, like many others in the globe, confronts such as food safety difficulties. The summary offers also an analysis of some technologically based solutions for LA food security issues. As a general call, the present review article calls for a collaborative and transdisciplinary approach to think deeper about how to solve food security problems, putting the focus on enabling technologies within a context of social, market, and global trends to achieve food and nutritional security. The review is positioned far from techno-optimisms and, at the same time, away from purely economic-based solutions. Conversely, this review embraces the whole complexity that brings economy-nature-technology triad. Embracing such complex relationships between technology, nature and the socio-economy aspects of food security LA issues. Such complexity also triggers a need for a solution that considers a renewed approach to sustainability in the whole food value chain from production to consumption. Sustainability in the value chain opens up a much-needed approach to LA food security that broadens, and refresh, our understanding of this fundamental socio-economic and technical phenomena.

TI  - Food safety and the political economy of food governance: the case of shrimp farming in Nam Dinh Province, Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - This contribution is a critique of the public and private governance models in response to the food safety crisis in Vietnam. Using shrimp farming in Nam Dinh province as a case study, the paper argues that public food governance has addressed some of the safety issues in the input sector but remains largely ineffective at the production level due to limited financial and human resources. In turn, private governance has had more successes but its impact is limited to the value-chain while food safety can be influenced by both sectoral and cross-sectoral production practices. In addition, it reinforces the subordination of direct producers by keeping them within industrial production, passing down the cost of safety compliance, and forcing them to assume production risks while reducing their profit margins. More importantly, safety governance under industrial farming is likely to open new opportunities for land expropriation and concentration, affecting the livelihood of small farmers and potentially leading to political unrest. The essay thus asserts that food safety needs to be addressed under the integrated framework of Food Sovereignty, which seeks to obtain food quality, including safety together with agroecological production, farmers' control of productive resources and the enabling of local trading systems.

TI  - The spillover effect of direct competition between marketing cooperatives and private intermediaries: Evidence from the Thai rice value chain
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Despite the widespread belief that marketing cooperatives' benefits may extend beyond participating farmers, little is known about the cooperative's effect on nonparticipating farmers. This paper exploits exogenous variation in language spoken at home in Thailand to obtain instrumental variable estimates of the spillover effect of marketing cooperatives. We hypothesize that farmers who sell rice to private intermediaries in the area where there is direct competition between marketing cooperatives and private intermediaries (treated areas) are likely to receive a higher price than those who sell rice in other areas. Using household-level data of rice farmers in Thailand in the marketing year 2018/19, we find strong evidence that farmers in treated areas receive 10.9% higher prices from private intermediaries than those in comparison areas. Our results provide crucial implications for food policy debates regarding the role of marketing cooperatives in agri-food value chains. In particular, evaluating the inclusiveness of marketing cooperatives toward poor farmers should not be limited to sampling and analyzing its members only. Failure to consider the spillover effect could lead to substantial underestimation of the impact of marketing cooperatives on societal welfare.

TI  - Foreign direct investment and local supplier upgrading ? the case of grocery retail in Turkey
T2  - GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-DANISH JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Foreign direct investments (FDIs) are noted as an important cross-border channel for knowledge. Thus, expanding companies can contribute to local supplying companies? capability development, an important precondition for upgrading processes. Several transnational grocery retailers have expanded globally and introduced modern supply chain management practices to markets of emerging and developing countries. However, agri-food industries are under-researched regarding FDI-induced knowledge transfer and supplier upgrading. Based on qualitative interviews with both retailers and suppliers in the emerging market of Turkey, this article discusses the upgrading processes of fresh food suppliers driven by the FDI of grocery retailers. This article shows how the foreign retailers? fresh fruit and vegetable supply structures have evolved towards the preferences of suppliers that vertically integrate value chain functions. Within this dynamic, transnational retailers proactively shape their suppliers and promote (functional) upgrading. The findings imply that (1) local regulatory environments should foster local sourcing and (2) the way for suppliers to work towards a solid value chain positioning is to fully integrate supply chain functions including agricultural primary production. This article argues that integrating low value-adding functions can be a type of functional upgrading that has not yet been acknowledged.

TI  - Export horticulture - empowering female small-scale farmers in Kenya?
T2  - ERDE
AB  - Export horticulture is one of Kenya's most dynamic sectors, with the Mount Kenya Region playing a crucial role as a result of its professional large-and small-scale production and marketing structures. The sector is consequently referred to as a "success story of African regional development" (Dolan and Sutherland 2002: 1). A qualitative case study was carried out to understand the impacts on gender inequality of the integration of horticultural smallholdings into the fresh fruit and vegetable (FFV) supply chain to the European market. It will be outlined how export horticulture affects female small-scale farmers with reference to local distribution channels, the organisation of the farm as a group or an individual player, and the specific organisation of labour on the farm. The focus here is on the traditional division of labour, ownership and mobility patterns, as well as knowledge and income. The study shows that the influence of the integration in the FFV chain on gender inequality is conditioned by both the type of relations to the buyers and the internal and institutional organisation of the smallholding. Surprisingly, in some areas of the primarily male-dominated rural society, an integration in the form of outgrower schemes that resem-bles Gereffi et al.'s model of a captive value chain, with women farmers exclusively responsible for export production, can enhance gender equality, as women gradually gain more decision-making power and greater independence.

TI  - From Power Imbalance to Interdependence: A Case Study of the Chadian Sesame Supply Chain
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Smallholder farmers are crucial actors for rural development in Africa. Their participation in global agro-food chains assures a source of revenues and agricultural development. Nevertheless, their position is still marginal. Moreover, there is a lack of data about the participation of smallholder farmers in African supply chains. The paper aims to identify the power regime between farmers, processors, middlemen and exporters and analyse how collective actions and external players' intervention may modify the bargaining power in the sesame value chain in Eastern Chad. The analysis is based on qualitative data gathered from semi-structured interviews with 98 farmers and 41 stakeholders. The study applies a netchain perspective, analysing the vertical relationships along the food chain in terms of power regime and the horizontal relationships of farmers by observing the first impact of collective actions. The results reveal that the dyadic ties are characterised only by supplier and buyer dominance, and there are no relationships characterised by independence and interdependence along the food chain. Especially, farmers suffer from both buyer and supplier dominance. The analysis of the horizontal relationships reveals that only middlemen organise horizontal agreements to improve their benefit in the commercialisation. The introduction of collective actions for farmers improves their horizontal relationships with potential positive impact on the farmers' vertical relationships along the supply chain. Thus, their bargaining power may be further developed. This study offers a diagnosis of the farmers' participation in value chain and future perspectives on the collective actions.

AB  - China's central government has long signalled its desire for scaled-up agriculture. This study scrutinises the place-specific dynamics of this government-led restructuring by examining the networks of socioeconomic relations that produce tea as a commodity in Shangnan County, Shaanxi. We identify a core production-circulation network comprised of relations between agribusinesses, cooperatives and smallholders. This network is historically contingent, deeply embedded in the logics of scaling-up and poverty reduction, and is composed not just of people and institutions, but of flows of policies, capital, and value. While larger operators have accumulated great capital and political resources, outcomes for small farmers remain ambiguous.

TI  - Toward sustainable intensification of agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - FRONTIERS OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB  - Across the African continent efforts to intensify agriculture have been limited to specific commodities, locations or particular production schemes. The causes for the widespread failure to overcome low land and labor productivity while maintaining ecosystem services have often be analyzed but remain poorly understood. A social-ecological system approach may help to better understand the complex nature of ecological disadvantages, postcolonial structures, limited connect between producers and consumer markets, low off-farm livelihood opportunities, partial underpopulation and lacking experience with the concept of sustainable production as a major impediment for sustainable intensification of the agricultural sector. Nevertheless, recent success stories in agro-pastoral systems as well as urban vegetable and animal production and associated value chains in West Africa, and in intensive mixed-cropping systems of the Great Lakes Region show the potential of stakeholder-driven agricultural intensification. Proper interpretation of these cases may provide lessons for a more widespread eco-intensification of smallholder agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - DETERMINANTS OF SMALL SCALE DAIRY SHEEP PRODUCERS' DECISIONS TO USE MIDDLEMEN FOR ACCESSING MARKETS AND GETTING LOANS IN DRY MARGINAL AREAS IN SYRIA
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
AB  - The paper describes value chain actors and institutional arrangements along value chains, and identifies major determinants of farmers' decision making to work with middlemen/traders 'jabbans' (or cheese makers), and based on those identify short implications for research, development and policy processes. We hypothesize that small-scale sheep producers are more dependent on middlemen for market and loans than larger holders, leading to welfare losses. Our empirical findings based on a Heckman model applied for 120 farming households conducted in Khanasser region (Syria) show that despite unequal benefits, local arrangements are more blessing than curse for the poor. Small-scale sheep producers and middlemen developed intricate institutional arrangements that are mutually beneficial. Producers act collectively to pool sufficient quantity of milk to be attractive to traders (jabban) while gaining access to market and cash loans mainly for feed. This provides the middlemen needed supplies with reduced transaction costs. This suggests that development organizations should support local capacity of producing organizations to work together, small-scale producers to organize, develop small scale dairy processing workshops for pooling and possibly processing milk, support training for direct market access and facilitate access to loans. Finally, supporting organizations such as rural financial services and micro-finance need to ensure up-to-date market information is available to ensure fair prices are paid. They should also be able to negotiate favourable conditions for loans and reach out to these resource-poor rural populations where formal credit systems are absent.

TI  - Multilevel innovation platforms for development of smallholder livestock systems: How effective are they?
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Context: There is growing recognition that sustainable development of smallholder agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa requires a systems approach. One response to this has been applying the agricultural innovation systems concept and the use of Innovation Platforms (IP) as tools for agricultural development. By providing social space and facilitating interactions among farmers, researchers and other stakeholders, IPs can promote collective action and foster innovation.
   Objective: The question is, how effective are these IPs in stimulating innovation that can be sustained beyond their lifetime, and can they be used to link issues across multiple scales? The case study reported here examined the effect of a multilevel IP structure in achieving smallholder livestock innovation outcomes in the Ethiopian Highlands.
   Methods: Two years after the multilevel IPs were phased out, focus group discussions and key informant interviews with multiple stakeholders from all levels of the IP were undertaken to collect qualitative data on the innovation processes and analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results and Conclusions: Our findings indicate that a series of IPs inter-linked across scales facilitated researcher-led technical innovations that enhanced farmers and livestock experts' capacity around feed technologies. The multilevel IPs also improved linkages and strengthened partnerships between actors within and across levels to effectively implement farm-level technologies. However, sustained innovation requires creating a shared understanding among actors on the complex nature of the various value chain issues that need to be addressed to achieve meaningful change. Specifically, we found that farmers lack access to affordable services. This requires integrating value chain concepts within multilevel IPs at the early stages of formation to engage relevant actors across levels to stimulate multiple interventions beyond the farm-level.
   Significance: Changes are needed at the organisational level to facilitate reconfiguration of resources and devolution of responsibilities to support the innovation process. The existence of power dynamics and an institutional context favouring the status quo are key issues that need to be considered when building and evaluating effective multilevel IPs to achieve inclusive value chain innovations.

TI  - Beyond Numbers: Determining the Socioeconomic and Livelihood Impacts of African Swine Fever and Its Control in the Philippines
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - The impacts of African Swine Fever (ASF) have most frequently been described quantitatively though it is increasingly acknowledged these impacts extend well beyond numbers. During 2020, a multidisciplinary team of researchers developed a framework for Socioeconomic and Livelihood Impact Assessment (SELIA) of livestock diseases in smallholder communities. Two key innovations within this SELIA framework are the integration of sustainable livelihoods concepts to capture rich information beyond financial impacts, and the inclusion of stakeholders across the value chain, beyond farmers. This paper focuses on the findings from one of the first applications of the SELIA framework. In late 2020 the research team applied participatory tools from the SELIA Framework (8 focus group discussions, 14 key informant interviews, and 2 network mapping activities) to gather data to describe the impact of ASF in backyard pig-farming communities and value chains. This was undertaken across two locations in the Philippines, in turn highlighting potential leverage points for intervention. Owing to COVID-19 travel restrictions and risks, modifications to training and field activities were made. Findings from focus groups and interviews revealed the deep, emotional impacts of ASF and the associated control measures. Pigs were considered pets by many farmers and some women described them as being like their children. Animal health-workers (AHWs) also recognised the emotional toll on farmers and were sometimes strongly criticised by community members due to their involvement in depopulation campaigns. Misinformation early in the epidemic also led farmers to hide their animals from AHWs, and to dispose of them inappropriately. While the overall impact of ASF on society was negative, the impacts across different communities, scales of production and different value chain actors varied. The losses experienced by backyard farmers resulted in significant losses to linked value chain actors, such as input suppliers. This trial application of the SELIA framework revealed some complex and varied impacts of ASF. This included significant differences in livelihood and socio-economic impacts amongst different actors within value chains and also among different categories of actors (for example small, medium and large-scale traders). Repeated themes and triangulated findings suggest two leverage points for further consideration. Firstly, it is recommended a One Welfare approach to ASF control in the Philippines is explored. Emphasising careful communication between animal health-workers and farmers, and humane and sensitive pig depopulation practices. Secondly, consideration of ASF support programs tailored to sectoral and specific communities is recommended.

TI  - What Factors influence smallholder farmers' decision to select a milk marketing channel in Zambia?
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - Farmers are faced with computational and informational limitations when making marketing decisions. This holds true for Zambian dairy farmers. This study examined the factors that influence the choice of milk marketing channels among 251 smallholder farmers in Zambia participating in milk production and marketing using a multinomial logit model approach. Three milk marketing channels were identified: direct, traditional, and modern. Relative to the base category (direct), the results indicate that gender and volume of milk produced positively influenced participation in the traditional marketing channel. However, off-farm income had a negative influence on the selection of the traditional marketing channel. Gender, education, distance to major markets, and volumes of milk produced influenced the decision to participate in the modern marketing channel. There seems to be an underutilisation of the modern marketing channel. The study identified the following factors to stimulate participation in the modern marketing channel: (i) concerted value chain investments, (ii) government intervention in the form of policy changes, (iii) increased access to market information, (iv) support services, and (v) transparency in the milk value-chain. Understanding the factors that influence farmers' participation in the informal channels enables tailored policies to support the formalisation of existing structures in the informal sector.

TI  - Fuelwood value chain analysis in Cassou and Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso: From production to consumption
T2  - ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The majority of households in Burkina Faso, particularly in the rural areas, rely on fuelwood as their main source of energy for cooking and heating. This consumption trend is expected to continue and even increase in the coming years, driven mainly by the population growth. Although sustainable woodfuel management has been considered in the country, pressure on forest resources is continuously increasing, as a result of fuelwood production. In this study, the different processes within the fuelwood value chain (FWVC) were analyzed in the village of Cassou and Ouagadougou, with a survey directed to the FWVC actors (from harvesters to consumers). Social, economic and environmental aspects were considered in the analysis, as well as the legal dimension within the VC. From the analysis, two lines of formality were identified (i.e. formal and informal). Formality varied depending on the location and the process implying also a gender aspect; for instance, all harvesters and most of the collectors (mainly men) in Cassou belonged to associations (formal), while most of the transporters and traders (mainly women) in Ouagadougouwere not part of any association (informal). Fuelwood price fluctuation was also affected by the formality since formal actors followed the official prices while informal ones established the prices freely. Informality also leads to uncontrolled exploitation of forest resources contributing to the forest decline. The present study provides a general overview of the situation in Cassou, a small village in Burkina Faso and suggests that other issues need to be considered to fully assess the sustainability of fuelwood VC in the country and to be able to create strategies and policies to e.g. decrease the negative impact on the environment. Therefore, itwould be most needed to carry out a detailed analysis, involving formality, with all the actors - covering gender issues, processes and flows at a larger scale across different regions.

TI  - Farmers' producer companies in India: a new concept for collective action?
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE
AB  - Producer companies can help smallholder farmers participate in emerging high-value markets, such as the export market and the unfolding modern retail sector in India. As elsewhere in the developing world, in India, small farmers' livelihoods are being threatened due to the liberalization and privatization of Indian agriculture and the increasing interest of private capital in the agribusiness sector. The withdrawal of the state from productive and economic functions, and changes in the organization of marketing channels, present new challenges for small-scale farmers. In this environment of greater instability and competition, organization and collective action can help to enhance farmers' competitiveness and increase their advantage in emerging market opportunities. We build on the ideas of value-chain governance and collective-action literature and introduce the functions and organizational structure of producer companies in India within this context. On the basis of a case study of a specific producer company in Maharashtra, which produces and markets mango and cashew nuts, we discuss the potential benefits for rural communities and the reempowering effect of this form of farmer organization.

TI  - Experimental and survey-based data on willingness to pay for seafood safety and environmental sustainability certification in Nigeria
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
AB  - Aquatic foods, including fish, are a substantial component of animal source foods globally, and make a critical nutritional contribution to diets in many contexts. In the global North, concern among consumers and regulators over the safety and environmental sustainability of seafood, particularly in developed nations, has led to the development of increasingly stringent seafood safety standards. While such standards may constitute regularity, logistical, and economic barriers to participation in export markets by small-scale producers, they have in other contexts catalysed upgrades to production and post-harvest handling practices within value chains associated with both capture fisheries and aquaculture. The health burden of foodborne illnesses is a major concern in developing countries. As incomes rise, consumers in developing countries are increasingly willing to pay a premium for safer and environmentally sustainable foods. However, there is little empirical evidence on consumers' willingness to pay for seafood safety in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Data on demand for seafood safety and environmental sustainability certification in African countries are largely unavailable in the public domain. In this paper, we describe data collected in Lagos State, Nigeria in October and November 2019. Experiments in the form of Becker-DeGroote-Marschak (BDM) auction mechanism, and post experiment surveys were conducted with 200 fish consumers in fish markets. These data can be used to assess whether consumers' demand for safe and healthy seafood from local markets can be harnessed to generate positive economic returns to producers. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Possibilities of establishing a smallholder pig identification and traceability system in Kenya
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - Consumers have a right to safer foods, and traceability is one approach to meeting their expectations. Kenya does not have an operational animal traceability system, and while a few initiatives have been piloted, these have only focused on the beef value chain. In this paper, we begin a discussion on traceability in the pig value chain, with an initial focus on smallholder systems of Western Kenya. First, a background to local pig production is given, and a description of animal identification and traceability options applicable to these systems is explained. Based on this, a "butcher-to-farm" traceability system, with health, production and food safety as objectives, is discussed. Requirements for establishing such a system (including actor incentives) are additionally discussed. The proposed approach can be piloted in the field and findings used to inform the design of a larger pilot and possibly pave way for implementation of a national traceability system, in line with the guidelines provided by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Organized systems in the area (including commercial producer and trader groups) would offer a useful starting point.

TI  - Tailoring slaughter weight of indigenous Vietnamese Ban pigs for the requirements of urban high-end niche markets
T2  - NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Slaughtered at heavy live weights, carcasses of the autochthonous Vietnamese Ban pig breed are not marketable on the highly remunerative niche markets of the urban Red River Delta. Therefore, Ban pigs are traded often at just 10 to 15 kg to avoid excessive fat accumulation. However, already, a moderate increase of slaughter weights might lead to rising profits for smallholder farmers in the uplands. Thus, this research aimed at investigating the effect of increasing live weight on the carcass composition and meat quality of indigenous Ban pigs qualifying for commerce on high-end markets. Fifty-six castrated male Ban fatteners with body weights ranging from 6.5 to 29.3 kg were collected from smallholder farmers applying a feeding system based on banana pseudostem (Musa spp.) and slaughtered by local slaughterers according to common practice. The carcass quality of 51 animals and, additionally, meat quality parameters of the loin and ham of 56 animals were assessed. For the evaluation of increased live weights on commodity prices, two pricing systems based on actual market prices for Ban fatteners in Son La town and Hanoi were suggested. Carcass fat depots did not significantly increase when body weights were raised from 12 to approximately 20 kg, and the distribution of primal cuts and the meat quality of the loin and ham were relatively stable. Thus, the currently applied slaughter weights for purebred Ban pigs appear to be suboptimal, and a moderate increase of slaughter weights to approximately 20 kg is feasible and could result in monetary benefits. In this context, the role of small-scale slaughterers for value chain upgrading is discussed. In conclusion, increasingly formalized value chains for traditional pork products could provide the potential to not only contribute to rural development in the Southeast Asian Massif, but also to the conservation of animal genetic resources of a highly valuable eco-cultural region.

TI  - Using a choice experiment approach to assess production developing the croton value chain in Kenya
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Trees that produce oilseeds have the potential to improve rural livelihoods through the production of vegetable oil for energy and other purposes, as well as valuable co-products, such as animal feed and organic fertilizers. In Kenya, Croton megalocarpus (Croton) is a prolific and widely distributed tree with such potential being currently underutilized. In support of scaling up the promising Croton value chain in Kenya, a choice experiment was designed and conducted as part of a survey with 200 rural households in four counties in the Central region of the country. The objective was to assess household preferences in planting and cultivating Croton trees for collection and selling of seeds to a growing market. Attributes for the choice model production system included seedling cost, oilseed yield, tree maturation period, labour for seed collection, and seed selling price. Results show that almost all households have Croton trees on their land and are willing to produce Croton seeds, although dear tradeoffs among the attributes exist. Seed price is the most dominant single attribute cutting across all socio-demographic characteristics. Time and labour constraints were significant for some households: farmers are more averse to longer maturation periods than non-farmers, while those already collecting seeds for the nascent industry are less concerned about the opportunity costs of time and labour than non-collectors. The results provide guidance for the development of a Croton value chain which can have positive impacts on rural livelihoods in East Africa.

TI  - Global Standards, Local Realities: Private Agrifood Governance and the Restructuring of the Kenyan Horticulture Industry
T2  - ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Over the past decade, private food safety and quality standards have become focal points in the supply chain management of large retailers, reshaping governance patterns in global agrifood chains. In this article, I analyze the relationship between private collective standards and the governance of agrifood markets, using the EUREPGAP/GLOBALGAP standard as a vantage point. I discuss the impact of this standard on the organization of supply chains of fresh vegetables in the Kenyan horticulture industry, focusing on the supply chain relationships and practices among exporters and smallholder farmers. In so doing, I seek to highlight the often-contested nature of the implementation of standards in social fields that are marked by different and distributed principles of evaluating quality, production processes, and legitimate actions in the marketplace. I also reconstruct the challenges and opportunities that exporters and farmers are facing with regard to the implementation of and compliance with standards. Finally, I elaborate on the scope for action that producers and policymakers have under these structures to retain sectoral competitiveness in a global economy of qualities.

TI  - Making Room for Smallholder Cooperatives in Tanzanian Tea Production: Can Fairtrade Do That?
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB  - The objective of this article is to examine the different ways that smallholders are brought into Fairtrade certification schemes in the Tanzanian tea industry. We examine the different ownership relations of processing factories and the perceived benefits of these different arrangements. We use descriptive qualitative analysis based on qualitative interviews and focus groups conducted between 2008 and 2010 to identify the significance between factory ownership organization and Fairtrade certification. We find that there is a movement toward innovation in the organizational strategies, which includes new ownership arrangements of processing factories and outgrower contracts that have been associated with certified Fairtrade production. We also suggest that organizational innovation is significant for obtaining scheme success yet perceived benefits of and increased information about Fairtrade production is independent from ownership shares in processing.

TI  - Development of livestock production in the tropics: farm and farmers ' perspectives
T2  - ANIMAL
AB  - Because of an increasing demand for animal-source foods, an increasing desire to reduce poverty and an increasing need to reduce the environmental impact of livestock production, tropical farming systems with livestock must increase their productivity. An important share of the global human and livestock populations are found within smallholder mixed-crop-livestock systems, which should, therefore, contribute significantly towards this increase in livestock production. The present paper argues that increased livestock production in smallholder mixed-crop-livestock systems faces many constraints at the level of the farm and the value chain. The present paper aims to describe and explain the impact of increased production from the farm and farmers' perspective, in order to understand the constraints for increased livestock production. A framework is presented that links farming systems to livestock value chains. It is concluded that farming systems that pass from subsistence to commercial livestock production will: (1) shift from rural to urban markets; (2) become part of a different value chain (with lower prices, higher demands for product quality and increased competition from peri-urban producers and imports); and (3) have to face changes in within-farm mechanisms and crop-livestock relationships. A model study showed that feed limitation, which is common in tropical farming systems with livestock, implies that maximum herd output is achieved with small herd sizes, leaving low-quality feeds unutilised. Maximal herd output is not achieved at maximal individual animal output. Having more animals than required for optimal production - which is often the case as a larger herd size supports non-production functions of livestock, such as manure production, draught, traction and capital storage - goes at the expense of animal-source food output. Improving low-quality feeds by treatment allows keeping more animals while maintaining the same level of production. Ruminant methane emission per kg of milk produced is mainly determined by the level of milk production per cow. Part of the methane emissions, however, should be attributed to the non-production functions of ruminants. It was concluded that understanding the farm and farmers' perceptions of increased production helps with the understanding of productivity increase constraints and adds information to that reported in the literature at the level of technology, markets and institutions.

TI  - Impact of Gendered Participation in market-linked value-chains on Economic Outcomes: Evidence from India
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - We combine the results of a laboratory experiment and survey of agricultural households to estimate the welfare impacts of a market-based intervention with links to value-chain. We investigate whether increased participation by women in such value-chains improves their relative bargaining power and therefore their ability to contribute to household welfare. We utilize the National Dairy Plan-I as an example to estimate pathways through which such interventions may affect household decision-making. We find that the program design significantly increased women's relative bargaining power within the household, which acts as an important channel for enhancing women's ability to contribute to household welfare through decision-making processes related to food, nutrition, branded food items, and child education. The instrumental variable estimates show that if valuechains are gender-neutral then direct program effects are significant but small. Participation in National Dairy Plan-I, on the other hand, improved women's relative bargaining power, allowing them to make substantial contribution to welfare. We show that when women's bargaining power mediates participation in value-chains, the nutrition elasticity rises from 0.26 to 0.94. While the impact on analytical ability (i.e., mathematics Z-score) is negligible in the absence of female agency, performance improves by 0.35 sigma when gendered element(s) of the program are allowed to act as a channel.

TI  - AN ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ANALYSIS OF OIL PALM AND ALTERNATIVE LAND USE SYSTEMS ON PEAT IN MALAYSIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF OIL PALM RESEARCH
AB  - In this article, we assess the potential of alternative land use systems using non-drainage peatland species which could eventually phase out or partly replace oil palm plantations on undrainable peatlands. We have used the ecosystem services approach to analyse what scenarios using drainage-free peatland species could be suitable alternatives for oil palm cultivation on peat and how these scenarios compare to oil palm plantations in terms of selected ecosystem services. Our results indicate that alternative paludiculture systems will provide more direct and indirect ecosystem services than oil palm plantations on peat. We also found that stakeholders were aware of issues with growing oil palm on peat, and that there was a general intention for sustainable use of peatlands amongst several groups of stakeholders. Replacing oil palm with alternative systems such as paludiculture in Malaysia is not yet realistic. The most important impediments are a lack of knowledge on potential of non-drainage peatland species and its associated value chains, as well as the technical difficulty for smallholders to implement such a system. We recommend starting experimental plantings with paludiculture systems to further test species performance, life cycle analysis, growth, intercropping limitations and possibilities, yields and improvements in the value chain.

TI  - Global value value chains, large-scale farming, and poverty: Long-term effects in Senegal
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - This paper presents panel data evidence on the impact of expansion of global value chains and large-scale export-oriented farms in developing countries over almost a decade. We estimate the income effects of wage employment on large-scale farms in the horticultural export sector in Senegal, using data from two survey rounds covering a seven-years period of rapid expansion of the sector. We estimate average income effects as well as heterogeneous income effects, using fixed effects and quantile fixed effects regressions. We find that poverty and inequality reduced much faster in the research area than elsewhere in Senegal. Employment in the horticultural export sector is associated with higher household income and the income effect is strongest for the poorest households. Expansion of the horticultural export sector in Senegal has been particularly pro-poor through creating employment that is accessible and creates substantial income gains for the poorest half of the rural population. These pro-poor employment effects contrast with insights in the literature on increased inequality from rural wage employment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Emulating value-chains of fast-moving consumer goods to improve uptake of co-packaged ORS and zinc for childhood diarrhoea: evaluation of the ColaLife trial
T2  - BMJ INNOVATIONS
AB  - Introduction Oral rehydration salts (ORS) and zinc comprise the globally recommended treatment for diarrhoea in children aged <5 years. However, limited access contributes to low uptake of this treatment and subsequently high rates of morbidity and mortality among this age group in low-income and middle-income countries. We adopted approaches used for private-sector value-chains of fast-moving consumer-goods, involving the simultaneous stimulation of supply and demand. These approaches were applied to the introduction of an innovative co-packaged diarrhoea-treatment kit (ORSZ co-pack) to increase ORS and zinc coverage at the community level in Zambia. Methods We tested our approach using an observational pre-post test study design in two intervention districts in rural Zambia (Kalomo and Katete), each with a matched comparator (Monze and Petauke, respectively). We assessed the effect on coverage, of ORS and zinc as well as ORS alone, by conducting household surveys of a total of 2458 and 2477 caregivers of children aged <5 years at baseline and endline, respectively, across the four districts. We also assessed whether the source of ORS (public or private sector) changed following the intervention. Results Both intervention districts experienced significant increases in coverage of ORS and zinc from <1% at baseline to 46.9% and 46.3% in Kalomo and Katete, respectively. Uptake in the comparator districts remained low at 1.7% and 0.6% in Monze and Petauke, respectively. For the secondary outcome examining ORS coverage (with or without zinc), the intervention was associated with a significant increase in Kalomo versus Monze, but not in Katete versus Petauke. There was a clear shift from the public to the private sector, and specifically to the use of the ORSZ co-pack. Conclusion Implementation of a value-chain creation approach for an innovative, over-the-counter, co-packaged diarrhoea-treatment kit can significantly improve the coverage of ORS and zinc.

TI  - CONTRACT FARMING RISKS: A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES
AB  - The objective of this study is to identify the key risks facing each of the stakeholders in the export-focused paprika value chain in Zambia. Although a deterministic cost-benefit analysis indicated that this outgrower scheme would have a very satisfactory net present value (NPV), a Monte Carlo analysis using an integrated financial-economic-stakeholder model identifies a number of risk variables that could make this system unsustainable. The major risks include the variability of the real exchange rate in Zambia; the international price of paprika; and the farm yield rates. This analysis points out that irrigation systems are very important for both stabilising and increasing yields. The analysis also shows the limitations of loan financing for such outgrower arrangements when at the sector level it is difficult or even impossible to mitigate the risks from real exchange rate movements and changes in international commodity prices. This micro-level analysis shows how critical real exchange rate management policies are in achieving sustainability of such export-oriented value chains.

TI  - The traditional dairy value chain in Zambia and potential risk factors to microbiological food safety
T2  - FOOD CONTROL
AB  - Milk is a highly valuable food for a balanced nutrition and contributes to food security in Sub-Saharan African countries like Zambia. The traditional dairy value chain accounts for a large share of Zambia?s total milk supply. Comprehensive surveys yielding in around 400 filled-in questionnaires were carried out among traditional/ smallholder farmers, milk collection centres (MCCs), informal traders, but also supermarkets/shops, and consumers in three Zambian provinces (Lusaka, Southern, Western). Using individual surveys for each stakeholder group, data were collected on general information and management practices, cattle disease management, hygienic measures, milk-handling practices, milk quality checks and backtracing, food safety knowledge, and milk consumption. The study provides insights into the traditional dairy chain and differences between the study provinces. For example, smallholder farms with high-yielding cattle breeds were dominating in the Lusaka Province, and here the MCCs received relatively large amounts of milk. In contrast, the surveyed farms in the Southern and Western Provinces were dominated by traditional cattle breeds, and the MCCs in the Western Province were the smallest. Distances for milk transport by farmers were largest in the Western Province, and here transport by foot was still common. Unrefrigerated storage and transport that favour proliferation of zoonotic agents in raw milk were frequently observed. Moreover, the survey uncovered hygiene deficiencies, particularly on farm level, for traders, and for consumers, which may further cause microbial contamination. Consumption of raw milk and products thereof was frequently identified and poses a health risk. Knowledge about food hygiene and safety needs to be improved along the Zambian dairy value chain.

TI  - Livestock in the rice-based economy of Office du Niger: The development potential for increased crop-livestock integration through multi-actor processes
T2  - NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - A diagnostic study of the development potential of livestock for the rice-based economy of the Office du Niger (ON) was conducted in Mali. The functioning of selected farming systems and value chains were studied by means of interviews, surveys and farmer group discussions. The findings show that in the ON rice remains the prime agricultural activity; although half of the farm households own cattle (for capital insurance and draught power), livestock management is troublesome because of a lack of grazing land and water points. Rice production is lucrative but approximately half of the farmers in the area studied do not have the land or capital to obtain a good harvest or sell at a profit. The ON supports rice farming through the provision of infrastructure and subsidies but the hierarchical structure of the ON's services and limited human resources hinder the timely availability and quality of its services. More affluent farmers do cope but poorer farmers have a problem to make ends meet. Diversification towards intensive livestock production might offer a new opportunity. The research station, dairy processing unit and dairy co-operatives are dynamic organizations and farmers appear eager to explore this opportunity but our analysis shows the revenue remains modest. We conclude that in order to improve the livelihood of the farmers, especially of the poor, it is critical to focus on institutional change within the rice sector. New forms of collaboration between the ON and the rice farmer organizations might solve most service delivery problems. However, this would require a long process of delicate brokerage, farmer organization and advocacy training. It would be important in the meantime to support activities that generate short-term visible results in the rice or dairy sector.

TI  - Indigenous chicken production in Kenya: I. Current status
T2  - WORLDS POULTRY SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB  - The majority of the Kenyan population resides in the rural areas and is characterised by low income and food insecurity leading to high levels of poverty. Poultry production and in particular indigenous chicken (IC) production play a significant role in the economic and social life of these resource-poor households, contributing to cheap source of animal proteins and cash income. Indigenous chickens are present whenever there are human settlements and their economic strength lies in their low cost of production which is a characteristic of the resource-poor rural households. They are highly adapted to the harsh scavenging conditions, poor nutrition and disease and/or parasite challenges. Their low productivity has hindered their exploitation. This paper highlights the current IC production circumstances with a view to identifying the major challenges which need to be addressed in order to improve the IC productivity and thereby improve the livelihood of the rural households who are the custodian of these genetic resources. It is concluded that the IC in Kenya posses high genetic diversity and are popular among the consumers. There is potential to improve IC productivity in Kenya and therefore individual and national efforts are required that takes into account the whole IC production value chain.

TI  - Disentangling the impact of a multiple-component project on SDG dimensions: The case of durum wheat value chain development in Oromia (Ethiopia)
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The overall objective of this paper is to assess the impact of a value chain development project - the AVCPO in the Bale region (Oromia, Ethiopia) - on smallholder households focusing on the relationship between the food security goal (SDG2) and other SDG-related outcomes such as education (SDG4) and collective action and social capital (SDG16).
   Possible co-benefits and synergies among the SDGs are explored using a variety of approaches ranging from instrument variable techniques to evaluate the project overall impact on the various SDGs, multi-valued treatment effect analysis to assess which project component is more effective in achieving the expected impacts, and causal mediation modelling to evaluate to what extent collective action and social capital can play a role in achieving food security and education.
   Our study shows that the aggregate impact is positive and significant on most of the considered outcomes, namely food security (SDG2) except diet diversification, education (SDG4) of girls but not of boys, and collective action (SDG16), while social capital (SDG16) is significant only as far as horizontal relationships within the community are created. Disentangling the aggregate impact, we show that combined treatments (e.g. training plus storage facilities and marketing through cooperatives) generally return larger impacts than stand-alone treatments (e.g. training only). Finally, our study finds that collective action (SDG16) is an important channel that favors food security improvement (SDG2) but only to a lesser extent better education (SDG4).

TI  - Fish Value Chain and Its Impact on Rural Households' Income: Lessons Learned from Northern Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - These days, one of the global challenges is the growing demand for food. To be more specific, seafood bases play a key role in filling the nutritional requirements of human beings. In Africa (Ethiopia) the public expenses to improve productive capacity in aquatic food are increasing. Additionally, the expenses in dams and in fishers' capacity building have increased households' engagement in the fishery sector in Ethiopia. Cooperatives' productive capacity has been strengthened by the government and other non-government organizations with the supply of fishing boats, refrigerators, fish nets and other office supplies. However, the effect of such public expenses in bringing changes in the households' livelihood and welfare has never been assessed in this study area. This paper aims to investigate what motivates the households to fish and assess the effect of fisheries on the households' livelihood and welfare. A structured survey consisting of 313 rural households was administered using trained enumerators in two kebeles located close to the Tekeze dam, Northern Ethiopia. The result indicates that socioeconomic characteristics, such as age (young), sex, education, and active family size were driving the households to fishing. Access to market and access to support are driving farmers to fisheries. There is a significant difference in fishing households' income which is higher than non-fishing households. The results also indicate that there are lesser income inequalities among fishery households operating in cooperatives compared to private fishery households.

TI  - A closer look at the Brazilian Social Fuel Seal: uptake, operation and dysfunctions
T2  - BIOFUELS-UK
AB  - Due to the increasing concerns about the social effects of biodiesel production in developing countries, the Brazilian government created the Social Fuel Seal (SFS) within the framework of the National Program of Production and Use of Biodiesel (PNPB) launched in 2004. The SFS is a certification scheme awarded by the MDA/MDSA (Ministry of Agricultural Development/ Ministry of Social and Agrarian Development), aimed at upgrading small farmers in the biodiesel value chain. In this article we discuss the institutional settings and explore the uptake, achievements and shortcomings of this political instrument in the light of the official data and the academic literature. Specific aspects of the practical implementation of SFS are examined upon the base of interviews conducted with different stakeholders in the state of Sao Paulo. Important dysfunctions in the overall operation of the SFS put into question the accomplishment of the social inclusion objective and awaken concerns about the sustainability of the role of family farmers in it.

TI  - The contribution of vegetable value chains to the Guatemalan economy
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB  - In Guatemala, 92% of all farmers possess less than seven hectares of land. For these smallholders, the production of labor-intensive crops such as vegetables can be an additional income source. Indeed, most vegetables in Guatemala are predominantly grown by smallholders. Vegetables such as cabbages, onions, carrots, broccoli, tomatoes or chilies are mainly used as cash crops which are channeled by exporters, wholesalers and retailers to national and international markets. They are also highly dependent on chemical input use. Thus, they create important forward and backward linkages, generating employment and value added in input, processing and trading sectors. The present study examines the main vegetable value chains in all agricultural regions of Guatemala by using primary data from interviews with agro-industry and commerce. The methodology uses input-output tables to show key variables such as value added and employment. To quantify the forward and backward linkages of the vegetable sector and compare them to other important agricultural products of Guatemala, a bottom-up-approach is utilized, starting from agricultural production, following the value chains back and forth from the local to the national level. Results show that less than half (45%) of total value added is produced in horticulture, 17% in industry, and 37% in commerce. This means that for each dollar created in the vegetable sector, more than one dollar is generated in its forward and backward sectors. Vegetables show much higher land productivities compared to other crops, and create five times more employment per hectare compared to the average of other crops in Guatemala. Additionally, for each job in vegetable production, 1.6 jobs are generated in its mainly informal forward and backward sectors, more than in the other value chains included in the study. In short, vegetable production is highly effective in job and income creation for smallholder farmers as well as for informal traders. Nevertheless, excessive use of chemical inputs threatens the sustainability of vegetable production and requires more and better extension services.

TI  - Small Farmers in High-Value Chains: Binding or Relaxing Constraints to Inclusive Growth?
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Considerable empirical work relates participation in contract farming with farm profitability. However causation is far from settled as few studies control for endogeneity of participation. Moreover the link between contract farming and equity is ambiguous as the association between contract farming and farmer endowments is mixed. This case study of smallholders in the tobacco industry addresses these issues, and seems to be the first such econometric application in the Philippines. Based on a treatment effects regression, contract farming increases profitability, with participation biased toward smaller farm sizes, supporting the positive role of contract farming toward inclusive growth in rural areas.

TI  - Stakeholders' perceptions on sustainability transition pathways of the cocoa value chain towards improved livelihood of small-scale farming households in Cameroon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Given the persistent poor livelihood of cocoa-farming households, future climate predictions and the worldwide demand pressure for higher cocoa quality and productivity, there is still a strong need to find new approaches that guarantee a sustainable cocoa future in cocoa-producing countries amongst which Cameroon is one of them. This exploratory research investigates potential future pathways for the cocoa sector in Cameroon by mapping the perceptions of actors involved in the socio-technical regime. Qualitative expert interviews, structured questionnaires and field observation, as well as a focus group discussion have been applied to understand how a sustainability transition can be triggered. The study shows that actors envisage a sustainability change which determines their actions; however, their perceptions towards future transitions are not actively coordinated. Actors are not finding a way of adopting new organizational structures and letting a transition occur effectively, like in the case of certification standards. An alignment of perceptions and activities, and a stronger cooperation between the private and public are strongly recommended. The study encourages to consider a coordination of actors' perceptions towards future scenarios as a starting point to study sustainability transitions.

TI  - Soybean production in Paraguay: Agribusiness, economic change and agrarian transformations
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE
AB  - Contemporary corporate-led agricultural commodity production has seen profound transformations in rural spaces. This article focuses on soybean production in Paraguay, analysing corporate activity in the productive, commercial and economic dynamics of the soybean market and identities the impacts of this monoculture on small farmers. Drawing on mixed methods, the research points to high levels of concentration of this market in the hands of a few transnational companies, which control the value chain via contractual relations with farmers. Through a complex set of relations, soybean production has seen smallholder farmers fall into debt and become unable to maintain their activity and migrate to new regions, leasing their land and, in the worst cases, lose both their land and status as farmers.

TI  - Smallholders do not Eat Certificates
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Voluntary standards and certification schemes aim to play an important role in the creation of a more sustainable production of agricultural commodities in the South. In this paper, we contend that most studies on the sustainability of these certifications take the objectives of voluntary standard-setting and certifying arrangements as the reference point, thereby implicitly accepting a problem definition that is not necessarily aligned with the needs, interests and preferences of the smallholder producers in a developing context. Based on the results of a four years research project on coffee and palm oil smallholders and certifications in Indonesia, this paper questions the transformative capacity of the standards and certifications regarding a more sustainable agricultural production. This capacity is located at the interface of the global demands, which are channeled down from the top of the value chain, and the local context where local producers take their decisions. Based on the empirical research it is argued that voluntary standards and certifications pave the way for a more sustainable agricultural production, but are not necessarily the right way forward to a more systemic change.

AB  - This paper relates the field experience of an international NGO in strengthening linkages between irrigation development and poverty reduction. Poverty Reduction through Irrigation and Smallholder Markets (PRISM) is introduced as a methodology for combining small-plot irrigation technology with complementary inputs and services to enhance small farmers' ability to participate effectively in markets for high-value agricultural commodities. Data from field projects in Nepal and India indicate that the PRISM approach can lead to significant additional income for small farmers and other micro and small enterprises in agricultural value chains.

TI  - Determinants of marketing channel choice among smallholder beef cattle farmers in Ghana's forest-savannah transitional zone
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VALUE CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study sought to understand the determinants of market channel choice among smallholder beef cattle farmers in Ghana's forest-savannah transitional zone. Data was collected from 200 farmers through the administration of a structured questionnaire and analysed using a multinomial logit regression model. The results revealed that the producers' level of education, herd size, mode of payment and price for cattle sold positively influence the producers' choice of marketing channel, whereas the quantity beef cattle sold, the reason for production, farmer access to extension services, years of farming experience, membership of a producers association and marketing cost negatively influenced the choice of marketing channel. The role of farmer-based associations, standardisation of the beef cattle trade, provision of market information to the producers, and profiling of the producers based on the basis of their production capacity are critical for the improvement of the businesses of the beef cattle farmers.

TI  - From smallholders to transnationals: The impact of changing consumer preferences in the EU on Ghana's pineapple sector
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - This paper explores the impact that a new type of pineapple, and subsequent changing consumer preferences in the Global North, has had on the livelihoods of pineapple growers in Ghana. The paper starts by tracing how research and development in Costa Rica by the world's largest producers of pineapple, Del Monte and Dole, have resulted in a new variety MD2. This new pineapple type has been marketed in the EU through campaigns carried out by plantation companies via supermarkets. Consumer preferences have subsequently switched to MD2 away from the varieties which previously dominated the market, including the Ghanaian grown Smooth Cayenne. Ghanaian smallholders have experienced a dramatic drop in the demand for Smooth Cayenne and are unable to switch to growing MD2. The Ghanaian pineapple sector is consequently being restructured with large-scale pineapple farms, principally run by transnational companies, growing large quantities of MD2 for export. Through a detailed empirical study of the changing livelihoods of pineapple growers in two settlements in Ghana, we show how smallholders have been affected in differing ways as transnational companies have increasingly entered the market. Recent attempts to incorporate smallholders as producers of niche pineapple products are discussed. The paper illustrates the mutual benefits of linking global value chain analysis with livelihood analysis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The role of small-holder seed supply in commercial mariculture in Southeast Asia
T2  - AQUACULTURE
AB  - Countries in South-east Asia are significant producers of aquacultured products and production is increasing. Seedstock for mariculture are provided from both wild capture ('capture-based aquaculture') and hatchery rearing ('full-cycle aquaculture'). Collection of Palinurid lobster pueruli and juveniles is currently the sole source of seedstock for aquaculture. Other mariculture commodities, such as milkfish (Chanos chanos) and groupers (Family Serranidae, Sub-family Epinephelinae) are supported by a combination of wild-caught and hatchery-reared seedstock. Mariculture in South-east Asia is typified by low levels of vertical integration, and a high proportion of 'small-scale' hatcheries. In Indonesia, small-scale hatcheries are clustered in two main areas: Buleleng Regency in northern Bali and Situbondo in East Java, with small-scale hatcheries comprising 95% and 88% of hatcheries in each area respectively. Fingerling production from these hatcheries is considerable, with 7.3 million grouper and 2.5 billion milkfish fingerlings exported from Bali in 2016. Although several studies have quantitatively evaluated the benefits of small-scale hatcheries to local communities, scant attention has been paid to their regional impact. As an example, much of the global production of around 1 million tonnes per annum of milkfish is supported by fingerling production by small-scale hatcheries in Bali. Despite this acknowledged success, disease remains an ongoing problem for small-scale hatcheries with operators of grouper hatcheries in Bali categorising mortality and financial losses as 'medium' to 'high'. A survey of small-scale hatcheries showed that biosecurity is poor and fish health management approaches are based on previous experience. Factors impacting these approaches include purchaser focus on price at the expense of quality, and limited numbers of hatchery staff with any formal aquaculture training. The impact of disease outbreaks remains a weakness for small-scale hatcheries, and consequently a weakness for the mariculture industries dependent on these as a seedstock source.

TI  - Profits versus jobs: Evaluating alternative biofuel value-chains in Tanzania
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Biomass production for bioenergy use may contribute to rural development by increasing household incomes, local employment and energy supply, especially in developing countries. This paper presents a value-chain approach to evaluating the profitability and competitiveness of producing biodiesel or ethanol. We apply a 'rapid appraisal' accounting framework to the case of Tanzania, which is a data scarce setting and therefore well-suited to the proposed approach. The framework also estimates the number of jobs created in the biofuel sector under different production arrangements and related demand for land resource. We evaluate the potential trade-offs between different scales of biofuel production (both the scale of feedstock production and biofuel processing). We find that only sunflower-biodiesel is profitable, especially if produced in large-scale estate farming systems. Estate farming is the best option for profits and competitiveness, even if domestic biofuel production is never competitive on the international market for energy. We also find that the number of jobs depends crucially on the involvement of smallholders. Establishing out-grower schemes (or similar arrangements), rather than estate farms, should be a key policy objective if biofuels production is going to improve rural economy. However social benefits may be gained at a cost of reduced international competitiveness and increased land exploitation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Monopsonists, Disruptive Innovation and Food Security: The Case of High-Value CommodityJEL codes
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES AND POLICY
AB  - Private firms in monopsony undertake disruptive innovation like contract farming (CF), where the firm invests in the food supply chain, provides credit, assumes the risk, and implements management strategies. This study investigates the impact of monopsonist involvement in CF and its impact on food security indicators among smallholders. Findings reveal that the monopsonist CF structure for ginger processing in Nepal increases the market price by about 18%, yields by 10%, and profits by 66%. However, the impact varies with farm size. Small farms (<= 0.51 hectares (ha)) engaged in CF have higher yields (18%), earn higher profits (81%), and receive higher market prices (12%) than small noncontract ginger producers. Contrary to popular belief, disruptive innovation in value chains by monopsonists could lead to higher yields, the market price received, and profitability for both small and large farmers.

TI  - Value Chain of Charcoal Production and Implications for Forest Degradation: Case Study of Bie Province, Angola
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - Forest degradation and forest loss threaten the survival of many species and reduce the ability of forests to provide vital services. Clearing for agriculture in Angola is an important driver of forest degradation and deforestation. Charcoal production for urban consumption as a driver of forest degradation has had alarming impacts on natural forests, as well as on the social and economic livelihood of the rural population. The charcoal impact on forest cover change is in the same order of magnitude as deforestation caused by agricultural expansion. However, there is a need to monitor the linkage between charcoal production and forest degradation. The aim of this paper is to investigate the sequence of the charcoal value chain as a systematic key to identify policies to reduce forest degradation in the province of Bie. It is a detailed study of the charcoal value chain that does not stop on the production and the consumption side. The primary data of this study came from 330 respondents obtained through different methods (semi-structured questionnaire survey and market observation conducted in June to September 2013-2014). A logistic regression (logit) model in IBM SPSS Statistics 24 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to analyze the factors influencing the decision of the households to use charcoal for domestic purposes. The finding indicates that 21 to 27 thousand hectares were degraded due to charcoal production. By describing the chain of charcoal, it was possible to access the driving factors for charcoal production and to obtain the first-time overview flow of charcoal from producers to consumers in Bie province. The demand for charcoal in this province is more likely to remain strong if government policies do not aim to employ alternative sources of domestic energy.

TI  - Durum Wheat (Triticum durum Desf.): Origin, Cultivation and Potential Expansion in Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Durum wheat is an important food crop in the world and an endemic species of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In the highlands of Ethiopia and the oases of the Sahara this crop has been cultivated for thousands of years. Today, smallholder farmers still grow it on marginal lands to assure production for their own consumption. However, durum wheat is no longer just a staple crop for food security but has become a major cash crop. In fact, the pasta, burghul and couscous industry currently purchase durum grain at prices 10 to 20% higher than that of bread wheat. Africa as a whole imports over Euro4 billion per year of durum grain to provide the raw material for its food industry. Hence, African farmers could obtain a substantial share of this large market by turning their production to this crop. Here, the achievements of the durum breeding program of Ethiopia are revised to reveal a steep acceleration in variety release and adoption over the last decade. Furthermore, the variety release for Mauritania and Senegal is described to show how modern breeding methods could be used to deliver grain yields above 3 t ha(-1) in seasons of just 92 days of length and in daytime temperatures always above 32 degrees C. This review describes the potential of releasing durum wheat varieties adapted to all growing conditions of SSA, from the oases of the Sahara to the highlands of Ethiopia. This indicates that the new breeding technologies offer great promise for expanding the area of durum wheat production in SSA but that this achievement remains primarily dependent on the market ability to purchase these grains at a higher price to stimulate farmer adoption. The critical importance of connecting all actors along the semolina value chain is presented in the example of Oromia, Ethiopia and that success story is then used to prompt a wider discussion on the potential of durum wheat as a crop for poverty reduction in Africa.

TI  - The next Great Trek? South African commercial farmers move north
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - This paper analyses the shifting role of South African farmers, agribusiness and capital elsewhere in the Southern African region and the rest of the continent. It explores recent trends in this expansion, and investigates the interests and agendas shaping such deals, and the ideologies and discourses of legitimation employed in favour of them. While for the past two decades small numbers of South African farmers have moved to Mozambique, Zambia and several other countries, this trend seems to be undergoing both a quantitative and a qualitative shift. Whereas in the past their migration was largely individual or in small groups, now it is being more centrally organised and coordinated, is more frequently taking the form of large concessions for newly formed consortia and agribusinesses, and is increasingly reliant on external financing through transnational partnerships. By early 2010, the commercial farmers' association Agri South Africa (AgriSA) was engaged in negotiations for land acquisitions with the governments of 22 African countries. This essay is the product of a scoping study to document and analyse major land acquisitions by South African farmers and agribusinesses, and the processes through which these have occurred and are occurring. It considers the changing character, scale and location of South African investments elsewhere in the region and the continent, and focuses specifically on the AgriSA-Congo deal (the largest deal concluded thus far), and acquisitions by the two South African sugar giants, Illovo and Tongaat-Hulett, for outgrower and estate expansion elsewhere in the region. The study addresses the degree to which South Africa is no longer merely exporting its farmers, but also its value chains, to the rest of the continent - and what this means for trajectories of agrarian change. It questions how we might understand the growing trend of 'intra-regional land grabbing' and, in the cases discussed, suggests that South African-based companies are acting as arteries of global capital.

TI  - Sticking with the old seed: Input value chains and the challenges to deliver genetic gains to smallholder maize farmers
T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - The Kenyan maize seed sector exhibits high hybrid adoption rates, a growing number of seed companies, and an extensive agro-dealer network. Nonetheless, maize yields remain low and uptake of new, stress-tolerant varieties has been disappointing. This article investigates interactions in maize seed value chains in Kenya, and decisions made by agro-dealers, farmers, and seed companies, to gain a better understanding of how to encourage the uptake of new, stress-tolerant varieties. Data were collected during the 2019 seed-purchasing season from Kenyan seed companies (n = 8), agro-dealers (n = 80), and farmers immediately following their seed purchase (n = 466). Most agro-dealers had a wide offer of seed products available, but seed companies' engagement with them was limited and marketing efforts were directly focused on farmers. Only a fraction of farmers used the agro-dealer environment to guide their decision-making. However, when agro-dealers engaged with farmers, they influenced varietal selection in 80% of the cases. Agro-dealers were one of the key information outlets about maize seed varieties. Seed company engagement with agro-dealers and in-store promotions (push marketing) should be further explored to improve returns on investments in seed systems.

TI  - Vertical coordination mechanisms and farm performance amongst smallholder rice farmers in northern Ghana
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - Despite the fact that contracting facilitates farmer participation in agrifood value chains, evidence on farmers' participation in different forms of contracts and the impact on farm performance is still limited. This study examines the determinants and impacts of vertical coordination mechanism-spot market transactions, written, and verbal contract-on-farm performance of rice farmers in northern Ghana, using a multinomial BFG model to account for selectivity bias. The findings indicate that vertical coordination participation decision is significantly influenced by age, access to credit, labor, association membership, and sales to institutional buyers. The empirical results also reveal significant gains in farm performance outcomes from participating in written and verbal contracts, relative to spot market transactions.

TI  - Small holder's carbon forestry project in Haryana India: issues and challenges
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - The small scale forestry carbon project in Haryana, India has been registered as a Clean Development Project (CDM) activity and is the first such projects from India. Developed under the Kyoto Protocol of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the projects aims at restoring heavily degraded sandune affected private lands and contribute to climate change mitigation. The project is expected to sequester 234,584 tons of carbon dioxide (tCO(2)) in 20 years project cycle with an average annual sequestration of 11,729 (tCO2) per year. The project is expected to have a total carbon stock of 385,253.1 ton Carbon (tC) in the project life span of 20 years as against 7,920.6 (tC) in the baseline scenario. The carbon credits earned from the project is supposed to provide additional incentives to the smallholders who have formed a cooperative society for this purpose. This paper addresses the issues and challenges in developing the project activity and also discusses the lessons learned in the process. The project is supposed to help in poverty alleviation and has become a success story for rehabilitating degraded lands in semi arid regions of India through plantation forestry.

TI  - Aflatoxin B1 Contamination of Dairy Feeds after Storage in Farm Practice in Tropical Environment
T2  - BIOCONTROL SCIENCE
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the contamination of aflatoxin B1 (AF-B1) when keeping various dairy feeds in a farm environment. The study was carried out from March to May 2011 and involved 63 small holder dairy farms belonging to a single dairy cooperative in Chiang Mai province, Thailand. All feed samples used for milking cows including 4 commercial concentrates (CC1 to CC4), by-products from local corn processing factories fermented in plastic bags (SIL), and corn and cob meal or corn dust (CCD). Feed samples were collected 2 times at before and after storage. Farmers were requested to store CC1 to CC4 and CCD for a month and SIL for a week using their routine on-farm storage arrangements. All samples were measured for their AF-B1 concentrations by ELISA. Results showed that AF-B1 concentrations of CC1 to CC4, SIL and CCD before storage were 5.1, 4.1, 4.0, 4.2, 5.5 and 5.5 mu g/kg, respectively, and after storage the concentration of AF-B1 were 9:7, 6.5, 9.8, 12.3, 11.4 and 20.0 mu g/kg, respectively. CCD at after storage was the only feed that had mean level more than 20 mu g/kg. Concentrations of AF-B1 at before storage in all feeds were significantly lower than after storage (P < 0.01), and the increased ratio of AF-B1 levels was approximately 2 to 3 times. The study concluded that increased AF-B1 levels are related to feed types and farm conditions.

TI  - Non-timber Forest Product Use and Market Chains Along a Deforestation Gradient in Southwest Malawi
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - The importance of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) to rural livelihoods is widely acknowledged globally, as is the income generated from casual or fulltime trade on village and urban markets. However, there is less understanding of how the condition or status of the neighboring landscapes influence the use of and trade in NTFPs. Here we report on the use and trade in NTFPs in four villages situated along a gradient of decreasing forest cover in southwest Malawi using a mixed-methods approach. Data were sourced via a survey of 286 households, value chain analysis of the four most commonly traded NTFPs (thatch grass, edible orchids, mushrooms, and wild fruits), key informant interviews with NTFP traders and direct observations. All households used at least one NTFP, with the most widely used being firewood (100% of households), bamboo (96%), thatch grass (94%), and timber for construction (92%). Overall, 15% of households sold at least one NTFP and the prevalence of selling within a village was correlated with forest cover, whereas buying of NTFPs was inversely correlated with forest cover. There was a wide range in mean annual income (US$20-456) from selling NTFPs based on the product, whether the trader sold on a casual or full-time basis and the market. Of those households selling NTFPs, approximately two-thirds sold more than one NTFP product, which is rarely recognized in income studies of individual market chains. The returns to labor were variable between villages and products, but were generally double or more than the national minimum hourly wage. The NTFP value chains were short, dominated by traders and some intermediaries. Most of the products were sold in local markets with little value addition. Overall, NTFPs were an integral part of the household economy, with multiple participants and users, partly shaped by the forest cover of the surrounding landscapes.

TI  - Setting the standard: Does Rainforest Alliance Certification increase environmental and socio-economic outcomes for small-scale coffee producers in Rwanda?
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES AND POLICY
AB  - Sustainability certification has become an important tool for promoting sustainable agricultural value chains. Nevertheless, its economic and environmental effects on the producer level remain unclear. We investigate the relationship of Rainforest Alliance Certification with socio-economic and environmental outcomes in Rwanda and consider potential tradeoffs between dimensions. To reduce potential selection bias in the econometric estimation, we use inverse probability weighted regression adjustment. We find no significant association between certification and socio-economic indicators but a significant correlation between certification and good agricultural practices and biodiversity-related practices. Effects on economic outcomes and biodiversity-related practices are linked; their relationship differs across climatic regions.

TI  - The rise of supermarkets in Zimbabwe against a tide of macroeconomic uncertainty
T2  - DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB  - Zimbabwe has experienced a rise in supermarkets despite its volatile macroeconomic environment. Using data elucidated from key informants in the supermarket retail sector, the study observes that Zimbabwe is still relatively attractive to foreign investors as its food retail sector is not yet saturated. Zimbabwe's supermarket expansion is driven by the entry of global, regional, and home-grown chains, growing urbanisation and an upsurge in consumerism. Unlike other African countries, Zimbabwe supermarket sector is unique due to its historical footprint, macroeconomic and policy uncertainty. Supermarket development challenges include exclusion of small farmers, modernising procurement systems, difficult operating environment characterised by liquidity crisis, hyperinflation, energy shortages, and deficient infrastructure. Future supermarket growth could emerge from a more stable macroeconomic environment, improved backbone infrastructure, upgrading value chains and penetration of untapped markets in second tier cities and small rural towns.

TI  - Credibility beyond compliance: Uncertified smallholders in sustainable food systems
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This article examines the phenomenon of uncertified producers of otherwise certifiable organic food embedded in value chains whose farm products conform to elevated environmental standards. Having embraced so called "beyond organic" cultivation approaches-including agroecology, biodynamic, and permaculture-producers undertaking restorative ecological practices on their farms are certification worthy, in principle, while remaining either unwilling or unable to pay to upgrade to premium markets, in practice. Confronted with the trade-off between allocating scarce resources to compliance and credibility-producers creating collective public goods may do so at the expense of being able to signal the credibility of their actions as environmental stewards along value chains, as through private, third party certification schemes. Drawing on insights from multiple waves of ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Nicaragua beginning in 2007, I show how this credibility dilemma exacerbates challenges already facing smallholders-including livelihood insecurity, political instability, and environmental degradation-demanding new institutional innovations that effectively lower the cost of credibility. In Nicaragua, peasant associations responded to this challenge by advancing an innovative institutional arrangement-the Grupo de Promocion de Agricultura Ecologica (GPAE) marca de confianza, Group for the Promotion of Ecological Agriculture's trademark of trust-to commercialize fresh produce destined for local consumption and new niche markets via networks of trusted producer communities.

TI  - Is there a pilot in the chain? Identifying the key drivers of change in the fresh pineapple sector
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - High-value export-oriented agriculture is today considered as a means of integrating smallholders into the world economy. This paper examines the geographic and organisational changes that have taken place in the fresh pineapple sector over the past 50 years. We begin with a historical analysis of the changes in leadership among producer countries, namely the dethroning of Cote d'lvoire by Costa Rica. We show that this geographical shift has been accompanied by massive organisational changes: the pineapple sector is increasingly driven by large downstream actors who derive their power from the ability to impose their definition of quality to the whole chain, and from economies of scale and scope. Although varietal innovation plays a key role throughout the period, commercial and logistical innovation are of increasing strategic importance. However, because of the constraints imposed by the concerned supply chains, small farmers risk being excluded or marginalized. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Tobacco Farming and the Reconfiguration of Co-operatives in Tanzania
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - Tobacco has been grown in Tanzania since the 1950s and remains a designated strategic export crop cultivated under contract farming arrangements. This article examines the role of primary co-operative societies (PCSs) in co-ordinating the tobacco contract farming system. The article traces the transition from public marketing boards to private sector predominance and contributes to an understanding of the dynamics of contractual arrangements between private capital and smallholder tobacco farmers. It draws primarily on data collected through in-depth interviews with tobacco-processing companies and the leaders of PCSs in Urambo district, Tanzania. The analysis shows that the PCSs that are central to this sector need to ensure that their members farm in accordance with good agricultural practices and comply with reforestation and labour practice requirements as part of the industry's focus on corporate social responsibility programmes and the promulgation of strategies addressing social and environmental concerns. Furthermore, the PCSs have become the gatekeepers for local development projects co-funded by the Tanzanian tobacco processing companies and global cigarette brand owners. The article argues that the PCSs' ability to capture economic benefits for local development by tapping into the tobacco value chain depends not only on PCS leadership qualifications, capabilities and their capacity to 'align' farmers with the required cultivation practices, but also on the bargaining capacity of the PCSs in relation to the tobacco processing companies, which is influenced by whether the supply base is reliable in both quantity and quality. Recent developments in the contract farming arrangements provide new constellations of economic dynamics and opportunities for social and economic development activities at the PCS and village levels. The article ends with a discussion of rural development outcomes based on tobacco revenues, showing how contract farming integrates local communities into the dynamics of the global tobacco value chain while simultaneously reproducing local socio-economic differentiation.

TI  - Combining participatory, qualitative and quantitative methods for impact assessment of food value chains into an integrated framework
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - An impact assessment of food-securing upgrading strategies (UPS) can be performed to assess actual and potential UPS effects at the local level. We developed an assessment framework that integrates the main components of the food value chain (FVC), including natural resources, food production, processing, marketing, and consumption. The framework provides a generic template in which different impact assessment approaches can be complementarily integrated and was tested for a case study in Tanzania. The framework employs a structured sequence of steps: (1) context analysis and the development of UPS, (2) the selection and application of assessment approaches and (3) the establishment of food security criteria and UPS effects. To illustrate the flexibility and use of the framework, the inputs of three different impact assessment approaches were considered. First, data from a household survey was applied to provide baseline information at the local level. Second, scientific knowledge was employed to systematically assess the selected UPS. Third, local stakeholder knowledge was considered to identify the local food security constraints and preferences and provide assessments of potential UPS effects. The Framework for Participatory Impact Assessment (FoPIA) approach was utilized to conduct local focus group discussions, and the Scaling Up Assessment Tool for Food Security (ScalA-FS) was employed to gather scientific knowledge about specific UPS impacts. Based on the preliminary results from the framework testing, diverse stakeholder participation was found to be essential for considering local preferences and to engage stakeholders in the assessment process, whereas scientific knowledge and monitoring data were needed to complement the "local picture" with more quantifiable results. The strengths and shortcomings of the framework are discussed.

The welfare gain from contract farming and employment on processor-owned estate farms is estimated using a maximum simulated likelihood estimator. Our results show positive welfare effects from participating in contract farming, but not from employment on processor-owned estate farms. The results imply that contract farming presents opportunities for economic growth, but additional effort is required to make the contracts more accessible to smallholders.

TI  - Farmer incentives and value chain governance: Critical elements to sustainable growth in Rwanda's coffee sector
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Limited producer participation and voice in the governance structures of the coffee value chain in Rwanda, a common occurrence in many agricultural export sectors in the developing world, have resulted in low farm gate prices, restricted competition and few incentives for producers to invest human and capital resources in improved coffee production. A twenty year downward spiral of low productivity and stagnant production has ensued. Survey data from 1024 coffee producing households together with key informant interviews and focus group discussions are used to examine how patterns of investment in coffee affect farmers' productivity and profitability. Findings show that artificially low farm gate cherry prices have driven down coffee production levels and at the same time have enabled a rapid expansion coffee processing capacity. A typology of producers based on capacity to invest and incentives to invest in coffee is constructed to help explain why smallholders are the most productive and largeholder farmers are the least productive when cherry prices are low. Smallholders are 'pushed' to produce out of necessity (poverty avoidance) while largeholders are 'pulled' to produce uniquely by the lure of higher profit margins, which they achieve only when higher producer prices prevail. Policy recommendations are advanced for greater inclusion of producers in the price negotiation process and for adopting a floor price formula that includes the real cost of production as established by this research.

TI  - Identifying viable nutrient management interventions at the farm level: The case of smallholder organic Basmati rice production in Uttarakhand, India
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Smallholder farmers may gain notable livelihood benefits by participating in organic value chains. However, whether there are enough resources available to maintain organic production sustainably on smallholder farms in resource-poor regions is of concern. If not balanced by sufficient inputs, continual nutrient export via commodity crops will result in nutrient mining, and livelihood improvements gained by participating in profitable value chains could be negated by soil degradation in the long term. The objectives of this study were to test an integrated approach for understanding the farm-level impacts of subsystem nutrient management actions and to identify locally viable interventions for increased nutrient supply and recycling. We employ a systems analysis methodology to address the nutrient gaps on smallholder farms in Uttarakhand, India producing organic Basmati rice for an international value chain. Farmers here rely on few livestock (three to five head of cattle ha(-1)) to supply nutrient inputs and are achieving smaller than potential Basmati yields. We surveyed 42 small farms (< 3.5 ha, average annual income around $1000 year(-1)) and analyzed available manure stocks for nutrient contents in order to trace the farm-level flow of manure nutrients, identify vectors of avoidable nutrient loss, and systematically identify locally relevant and feasible improvements. The interventions identified as viable were reducing nutrient losses through simple and relatively cheap manure management modifications (i.e. using straw bedding to capture livestock urine, covering farmyard manure stockpiles with plastic sheeting, enclosed biogas slurry storage, and using biogas slurry for improved compost production), in situ green manuring, and purchasing farmyard manure. Cost-benefit analyses predicted that proposed interventions could increase farmers' net profit by up to 40% while also addressing problematic nutrient gaps. While our results pertain specifically to Uttarakhand, we found that our integrated research approach worked well to address the problem of nutrient gaps on resource-poor smallholder organic farms, and believe that the strategy could be used with equal success to address similar problems in other regions.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices Related to African Swine Fever Within Smallholder Pig Production in Northern Uganda
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - Uganda is a low-income country with the largest pig population in East Africa. Pig keeping has a large potential, commercially and as a tool for poverty reduction, but African swine fever (ASF) is a major hurdle for development of the sector. The objective of this study was to evaluate knowledge, attitudes and practices related to ASF in the smallholder pig production value chain in northern Uganda. The study included three separate series of participatory rural appraisals (PRA), comprising purposively selected farmers and other actors in the pig production value chain. In the PRAs, various participatory epidemiology tools were used. A total of 49 PRAs and 574 participants, representing 64 different villages, were included. The results indicate that participants were well aware of the clinical signs of ASF, routes for disease spread and measures for disease control. However, awareness of the control measures did not guarantee their implementation. A majority of middlemen and butchers acknowledged having sold live pigs, carcasses or pork they believed infected with ASF. Outbreaks of ASF had a strong negative impact on participants' socio-economic status with loss of revenue and reversal into more severe poverty. In conclusion, lack of knowledge is not what is driving the continuous circulation of ASF virus in this setting. To control ASF and reduce its impact, initiatives that stimulate changes in management are needed. Because the behaviour of all actors in the value chain is largely influenced by the deep rural poverty in the region, this needs to be combined with efforts to reduce rural poverty.

TI  - Risk Factor Assessment of the Smallholder Baby Vegetable Production in Eswatini
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - The transition from subsistence to commercial production poses uncertainty and risks that require putting in place adaptive systems. Such systems are imperative for agricultural production where weather and food markets are always changing. Disregarding risk factors has a cumulative negative impact on the intended outcomes. The marginality of smallholder farmers' operational environment renders them limited to strive without government interventions. Research has proven that smallholder farmers face numerous challenges in vegetable value chains. The study sought to identify and characterise smallholder growers risk factors when producing for this value chain. A sequential mixed-method research design was adopted, and data collected from fifty-eight growers from three producer groups in the Manzini and Hhohho regions. Discriminant analysis validated the heterogeneity of respondents using the experience on risk factors. The growers were significantly affected by market and production risks. The clustered growers had a high probability of losses in the value of the harvest whereas the private growers had a high probability of yield changes. Fruit size and postharvest handling contributed to changes in the value of the harvest. An improved cold chain system could enable symmetry in the harvest scheduling and grade information as well as prompt payments. Interventions toward enabling access and use of quality farm inputs would curb yield variations. Future research could quantify yield losses at each stage of postharvest handling toward informing the risk management strategy.

TI  - The impact of oil palm on rural livelihoods and tropical forest landscapes in Latin America
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Does oil palm boost agricultural growth and reduce rural poverty, or is it a threat to rural livelihoods and tropical forest landscapes? This paper introduces a Special Issue on this question, focusing on Latin America. It reviews available literature and data for countries where oil palm either covers large areas (Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras) or has recently expanded (Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru), and presents evidence from nine case studies (including Nicaragua). Combining political economy with a livelihood approach, this article discusses how dissimilar policies supporting oil palm combined with contrasting agrarian change dynamics, market structures, and institutional arrangements driving rural inclusion (and exclusion) in oil palm production have resulted in a variety of expansion trajectories (ranging from smallholder-to plantation-based, plus mixed forms in between) and outcomes across the region. Main findings show that rural livelihoods and landscapes are most threatened where industrial plantations predominate, particularly in weakly governed forest frontiers, while oil palm is beneficial where policies guarantee land access and support smallholders. However, policies that are beneficial to smallholders do not preclude conflicts between oil palm smallholders (often migrant settlers) and forest-dependent (indigenous and Afro-descendant) communities opposing this industry.

TI  - Between Land Grabbing and Farmers' Benefits: Land Transfers in West Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY
AB  - Rapid growth of oil palm cultivation in West Kalimantan, Indonesia has increased both the pace and size of land transfers from farmers to big companies and city-based investors. This process has been widely conceptualised as 'top-down land grabbing' but this perspective largely neglects the agency of the farmers. This paper seeks to shed light on the agency of farmers with respect to how they respond to land transfer schemes. Through a study of land transfers under nucleus estate schemes (NES), schemes that were introduced by the Indonesian government in which smallholding farms are integrated parts of a modern, large size plantation company, we will show that agrarian dynamics are shaped by notions of what is 'fair' and 'just'.

TI  - Is the local wheat market a 'market for lemons'? Certifying the supply of individual wheat farmers in Ethiopia
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Bulking and mixing of smallholder supply dilutes incentives to supply high quality. We introduce wheat 'grading and certification shops' in Ethiopia and use an auction design to gauge willingness-to-pay (WTP) for certification. Bids correlate positively with wheat quality, and ex ante notification of the opportunity of certification improves wheat quality. These findings suggest that local wheat markets resemble a 'market for lemons', crippled by asymmetric information. However, aggregate WTP for grading and certification services does not re-coup the sum of fixed, flow and variable costs associated with running a single certification shop.

TI  - Justice and Inclusiveness: The Reconfiguration of Global-Local Relationships in Sustainability Initiatives in Ghana's Cocoa Sector
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
AB  - Pressure from the public and non-governmental organisations is pushing lead companies in the cocoa and chocolate sectors towards becoming more environmentally sustainable and socially just. Because of this, several sustainability programmes, certification schemes and delivery initiatives have been introduced. These have changed the relationship between chocolate companies, cocoa exporters, and small-scale farmers. This paper observes how large companies in the cocoa export and consumer markets are shifting away from their traditionally remote position in the cocoa sector. The pressure to ensure sustainability and justice has provoked more mutually dependent relationships with cocoa producers. Our analysis outlines the implications this emerging reconfiguration of global-local relationships has for procedural justice principles of interdependence and refutability, and the distributive justice principles of need and equity. These principles are important because they enable the different dimensions of inclusion: ownership, voice, risk, and reward. This paper highlights and qualifies arrangements surrounding these justice principles that manifest in the way five service delivery initiatives - associated with sustainability programmes and led by major buying companies in Ghana's cocoa sector - are implemented. We show inclusiveness as an outcome of dynamic global-local relationships that are constantly reworked in response to smallholder farmers' agency and state regulations. Portraying inclusiveness as an outcome of interactions changes its conceptualisation from a predefined ethical standpoint included in the design of standards to a result of unfolding mutual dependencies, which refashion how inclusive agriculture value chains work.

TI  - Value chains to improve diets: Diagnostics to support intervention design in Malawi
T2  - GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Governments and development partners looking to accelerate progress in addressing malnutrition have been examining how to use interventions in value-chains to improve diets. However, the links between interventions in value chains and diets involve a range of direct and indirect effects that are not yet well understood. We apply a mixed-method multisectoral diagnostic to examine potential interventions in food systems to improve diets of smallholder farmers in Malawi. We examine entry points for interventions involving public and private-sectors, and explore the methodological requirements for undertaking this type of multisectoral analysis. We find that although food consumption is dominated by maize, a range of nutritious foods are also being consumed; including leafy greens, fruits, chicken, dried fish, dried beans and peas, and groundnuts. Yet important deficits in nutrient intake remain prevalent in low-income households due to inadequate quantity of consumption. While increasing consumption through own-production is one potentially important channel to increase quantity of nutritious foods available (particularly fruits and leafy green vegetables), markets also play a potentially important role. Nutritious foods are available on markets year-round, although strong seasonality impacts the availability and price of perishable products. For beans, peas and groundnuts, supply appears to be available throughout the year, with price fluctuations relatively controlled due to storage capacity and imports. The capacity of markets to supply safe and nutritious food is limited by a number of issues, including poor hygiene; lack of infrastructure for storage and selling; limited information on nutrition, and weak coordination among sellers and producers. Other bottlenecks include: on-farm constraints for expanded production, consumers with limited purchasing capacity, intense competition among sellers and few services for sellers to increase volume of product sold during peak demand. The diagnostics identify the role of information-related interventions to optimize decisions related to food choices, involving a range of different foods and value-chains, that could potentially lead to short- and medium-term improvements in diets. Longer-term and more resource-intensive interventions are also identified, such as improving capacity for product differentiation, processing, storage, and market infrastructure across a different range of food chains, so as to maximise coherence between short- and long-term planning. The findings highlight the benefits of applying a strategic, food systems-based approach of identifying specific and complementary actions for both the public and private sectors that can improve the diets of low-income populations.

TI  - Diagnosing institutional logics in partnerships and how they evolve through institutional bricolage: Insights from soybean and cassava value chains in Ghana
T2  - NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Trade globalisation and climate change pose new challenges for food security in Africa. To unlock smallholder productivity, more understanding is needed of the institutional context and the role of development interventions, such as partnerships, in the food sector. This article proposes institutional logics as a theory and methodology for institutional diagnosis to gain insight into context-embedded negotiation and change processes created by project-based partnership interventions. We analyse the institutional logics of organisations active in the development of two value chains in Ghana to subsequently show how, in partnerships, these logics are negotiated in light of the objectives and interests of the intervention. The main findings are that donors, with their market and professionalisation logics, are quite influential, but many other development actors still adhere to principles of grassroots empowerment and social security. In the evolving partnership process, market logic remains strong, but coupled with institutional logics endorsing farmer empowerment and solidarity with the resource-poor. This is done in a process of bricolage in which field level implementers go against the dominant logic of project initiators: showing that newly introduced development logics are mitigated by an existing local structure fostering other development logics. The broader implication is that new development paradigms may need a considerable transition period to become mainstream. The concepts of institutional logics and bricolage as a diagnostic tool allow researchers to characterise the adherence to and blending of institutional logics by actors. This tool helps to understand the mobilisation strategy of the initiator and to follow the negotiation of logics that takes place amongst partners in partnerships. Detailed insights into the blending of potential partners' logics, pathways of negotiation processes and the plausible outcomes enable development practitioners to strategically prepare and manage their collaborative interventions.

TI  - An Analysis of Technical Efficiency in the Presence of Developments Toward Commercialization: Evidence from Tanzania's Milk Producers
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - The level and determinants of technical efficiency in milk-producing households are examined in connection with households' level of commercialization. A sample of 469 milk producers are modeled using Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). Average Technical Efficiency (TE) is estimated to be 80%, with variation among regions and generally reflecting levels of commercialization. Results show that assuming milk producers are rational, TE is increased by increasing the number of cattle, cows, and crossbreeds, and by additinal veterinary and feed inputs. These results support much existing research, and our contribution is the extension of analysis to actions and characteristics of the value chain due to commercial behaviors. We identify both direct and indirect potential effects of commercialization and identify mechanisms for their operation in development programs for commercial value chains. We find that credit access, training, group membership, market participation, and female household all improve TE while non-cattle income would reduce TE. We present sub-groups of households to better contrast levels of productivity and compare a limited number of the sub-groups' characteristics and actions. We provide commentary and explanation regarding commercialization and its direct and indirect connections to productivity. Recommendations include partnerships and facilitating actions that support commercialization, in association with improving efficiency in Tanzanian dairy.

TI  - Food insecurity as a supply chain problem. Evidence and lessons from the production and supply of bananas in Uganda
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB  - Despite agriculture being the main economic activity in Uganda, increasing food prices within the country point to the growing challenge of food insecurity. In 2016, food shortage was reported in some parts of Uganda (mainly in Karamoja sub-region and parts of Serere) and government resorted to temporary relief distribution of food from other regions of the country. The acute food shortage in one part of the country while another part, a few hundred kilometers away, has excess farm output calls into question the efficiency of the supply chain of some agro-commodities. This research attempts to examine the challenges faced in the production and supply of bananas in Uganda and how the supply chain perspective can help us address these challenges better. We juxtapose the supply chain approach against the value chain perspective and argue that the supply chain perspective offers a much deeper understanding of market-based challenges, which affect livelihoods of smallholders who often sell their products at rock-bottom prices.
   A cross sectional survey of various banana production and consumptions points in Uganda was conducted. The findings show that losses in the supply chain accounted for about 29% of banana production - a figure slightly lower than that 40% previously reported in the literature. In addition, the farmers did not benefit from increased food prices due to inadequate market information at their disposal despite banana value chains having recently received significant development attention. We also found that infrastructural bottlenecks and limited collaboration and coordination among smallholders heavily affected the supply of bananas in the country. This is arguably a key factor that strongly explains the food insecurity problem in Uganda. We conclude that the findings point to a different problem, which is that of a dysfunctional supply chain structure of bananas from the rural areas to urban centres in Kampala. (c) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - The role of access to finance for smallholders' seed business growth in Nepal
T2  - DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE
AB  - Finance is vital for commercialising seed businesses and the Government of Nepal has launched a priority sector-lending plan (PSLP) for financing agriculture. This article assesses the use and role of finance and the challenges in accessing PSLP loans, using interviews with 197 farmer households and stakeholders. The results show that awareness about PSLP can increase gross margins by 46%, but farmers have yet to take on PSLP loans. Bankers lack the agribusiness knowledge to support PSLP. The study recommends that policymakers and bankers harmonise policies and PSLP implementation by aligning loans with cropping cycles, farmers' institutions, seed value chains and effective outreach.

TI  - Characterisation of adopters and non-adopters of dairy technologies in Ethiopia and Kenya
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - While there is a general consensus that using dairy technologies, such as improved breeds of dairy cows, can substantially increase farm productivity and income, adoption of such technologies has been generally low in developing countries. The underlying reasons for non-adoption of beneficial technologies in the dairy sector are not fully understood. In this study, we characterised adopters and non-adopters of dairy technologies in Ethiopia and Kenya based on farmers' resources ownership in order to identify why many farmers in Ethiopia and Kenya have not adopted improved dairy technologies. As compared to non-adopters, farmers who adopt dairy technology own relatively more farm resources. The result signals that differences in resource endowments could lead to divergent technology adoption scenarios. Results show that a higher proportion of sample smallholders in Kenya have adopted dairy technologies than those in Ethiopia. Except for the use of veterinary services, fewer than 10% of sample farmers in Ethiopia have adopted dairy technologies-less than half the number of adopters in Kenya. The higher level of dairy technology adoption in Kenya can be ascribed partly to the long history of dairy development, including improvements in the value chain for the delivery of inputs, services and fluid milk marketing. Interventions that deal with the constraints related to access to farm resources and input and output markets could facilitate uptake of dairy technology in developing countries.

TI  - Quality as a Driver of Sustainable Agricultural Value Chains: The Case of the Relationship Coffee Model
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Specialty coffee markets that recognize coffee-quality price premiums can improve business conditions for smallholders and promote agro-ecological practices. We studied the Relationship Coffee Model (RCM), a business model that supports long-term partnerships between coffee buyers and smallholders based on product quality. We examined how biophysical conditions and production practices affect smallholders' ability to participate in this model. Furthermore, we considered common unobservable variables driving growers' participation such as farm soil quality and connection to social networks. In turn, we evaluated key environmental, socio-economic and technological outcomes, including tree and bird population diversity. Our estimations indicated that RCM participants employed more sustainable resource management practices, had better access to credit and were more informed and optimistic about the coffee business. However, we did not find significant farm-gate price differences. Increased adoption of organic farming and shade-grown systems to elevate coffee quality can stimulate sustainable business strategies. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

TI  - MILK Symposium review: Improving the productivity, quality, and safety of milk in Rwanda and Nepal
T2  - JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
CP  - MILK Symposium on Improving Milk Production, Quality, and Safety in Developing Countries at the ADSA Annual Meeting
AB  - Dairy production plays an important role in the lives of many people in Rwanda and Nepal. The aim of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Livestock Systems (LSIL; Gainesville, FL) is to introduce new location-appropriate technologies and to improve management practices, skills, knowledge, capacity, and access to inputs across livestock value chains in developing countries such as Rwanda and Nepal. To assist LSIL, our first aim was to describe gaps in the management of cows and in milk processing that constrain milk quality and quantity in Rwanda and Nepal. Our second aim was to describe training-of-trainers workshops in both countries as an initial response to the findings from the first objective. We conducted literature reviews and did rapid needs assessments in both countries. The literature reviews revealed similar aspects of the challenges of smallholder crop-livestock mixed farming systems in both countries. Many farms are struggling with feed quality, reproduction, and health of dairy cows. Milk production per cow and quality is often low. Fresh milk is collected by milk collection and cooling centers. Hygiene and milk processing capability and shelf life of products can be improved. Local rapid needs assessments were conducted in 2016 (Rwanda) and 2017 (Nepal) through visits to farms, milk collection and chilling centers, and processing plants, and through discussions with local dairy officials. The assessments supplemented and completed our understanding of stakeholders' needs in management and processing of milk. Limiting factors to improving the productivity, quality, and safety of milk in Rwanda and Nepal were a combination of sometimes limited knowledge in areas such as feeding, mastitis control, and hygiene, and a lack of access to resources such as quality feeds, transportation, and cooling that hindered implementation of existing knowledge. Training-of-trainers workshops in milk processing and hygiene were developed and given in Rwanda and Nepal based on the rapid needs assessments, and these were well received. We concluded that Rwanda and Nepal both have smallholder dairy farms that often face similar challenges such as lack of quality feeds, needs for basic dairy management education, low cattle productivity, and undesirable milk quality. Training-of-trainers programs to address these basic issues may be successful. Continued improvements in the dairy value chain depend on available resources for education.

TI  - Integrating market chain assessments with zoonoses risk analysis in two cross-border pig value chains in Lao PDR
T2  - ASIAN-AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES
AB  - Objective: Lao PDR's recent accession to the World Trade Organization necessitates a greater understanding of the patterns and risk of livestock production in order to better align national policy with the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. This eco-health study was conducted to improve understanding of the interrelations between market chains and zoonotic infection risks at two strategic cross border points between Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam.
   Methods: Information gained from smallholder farmer/trader interviews was integrated with serological surveys for pig-associated zoonoses-including hepatitis E virus (HEV), Taenia solium (T. solium) and trichinella-to identify potential linkages between disease risk and pig production and slaughter in low input systems common across the country.
   Results: Trichinella and HEV exposure was high in both humans and pigs in both study areas, significantly associated with pig slaughter and the subsequent consumption and handling of raw pork products. T. solium demonstrated a strong geographical and ethnic association with the northern study area bordering Vietnam. With the right knowledge and accessible, affordable inputs, the majority of smallholder farmers indicated a willingness to invest more in pig production, which could simultaneously improve livelihoods and decrease exposure to HEV, Trichinella, and T. solium through increased access to formal markets and an improved slaughter processes.
   Conclusion: The linkages identified when assessing disease risk in the context of potential economic and cultural drivers of transmission highlight the importance of a systems-based approach for the detection and control of zoonotic disease, and contributes to an improved understanding of the Lao PDR livestock sector.

TI  - Participatory assessment of animal health and husbandry practices in smallholder pig production systems in three high poverty districts in Uganda
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - While animal health constraints have been identified as a major limiting factor in smallholder pig production in Uganda, researchers and policy makers lack information on the relative incidence of diseases and their impacts on pig production. This study aimed to assess animal health and management practices, constraints and opportunities for intervention in smallholder pig value chains in three high poverty districts of Uganda. Semi-qualitative interview checklists through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were administered to 340 pig farmers in 35 villages in Masaka, Kamuli and Mukono districts. Quantitative data was obtained during the exercise through group consensus. Results of FGDs were further triangulated with secondary data and information obtained from key informant interviews. Findings show that pig keeping systems are dominated by tethering and scavenging in rural areas. In pen-urban and urban areas, intensive production systems are more practiced, with pigs confined in pens. The main constraints identified by farmers include high disease burden such as African swine fever (ASF) and parasites, poor housing and feeding practices, poor veterinary services, ineffective drugs and a general lack of knowledge on piggery management. According to farmers, ASF is the primary cause of pig mortality with epidemics occurring mainly during the dry season. Worms and ectoparasites namely; mange, lice and flies are endemic leading to stunted growth which reduces the market value of pigs. Diarrhoea and malnutrition are common in piglets. Ninety-three percent of farmers say they practice deworming, 37% practice ectoparasite spraying and 77% castrate their boars. Indigenous curative treatments include the application of human urine and concoctions of local herbs for ASF control and use of old engine oil or tobacco extracts to control ectoparasites. There is a need for better technical services to assist farmers with these problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Competitiveness and assimilation of information and communication technologies (ICT) in small producers of protected agriculture in Guanajuato, Mexico
T2  - REVISTA CORPOICA-CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA AGROPECUARIA
AB  - Competitiveness in the Mexican countryside is associated with farmers who have a formal organizational structure and who are aware of being a core part of the agricultural value chain. In the state of Guanajuato, Mexico, markets for smallholder producers are mainly local, and they continually survive thanks to government support. To improve competitiveness, organizations have used information and communication technologies (ICT). Thus, the aim of this research was to verify that the assimilation of ICT in smallholder producers of protected agriculture is a strategy that influences the improvement of the competitiveness of their production units (UP). In order to achieve the above, the policy analysis matrix (PAM) was adapted to calculate the levels of competitiveness, as well as the technology acceptance model (TAM) based on the theory of reasoned action (TRA), to determine the attitudes that influence the behavior and to calculate the assimilation levels of ICT. A highly significant relationship between competitiveness and the assimilation of ICT was obtained as the main result. In this context, we concluded that the level of competitiveness in smallholder producers of protected agriculture is highly associated with the ICT assimilation level. Therefore, smallholder producers are strongly advised to strive to incorporate these in the decision-making and management of their UPs.

TI  - Value-Supply Chain Analysis (VSCA) of crude palm oil production in Brazil, focusing on economic, environmental and social sustainability
T2  - SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB  - This paper is an evidenced-based analysis of sustainability (based on carbon, energy, blue-water, labour and economic footprints) of crude palm oil (CPO) production in Para, Brazil. It includes cradle to gate value/supply chain-based life cycle analysis (LCA), a socio-economic analysis of small holder farmers in Para; and a discussion on how operational and supply chain management (SCM) methods can assist practical application of LCA results. The LCA consists of 4 stages: nursery; plantation management; harvesting and transport of fresh fruits; and, extraction of CPO. The analysis was based on direct data obtained between November 2014 and August 2015. The total carbon footprint (CFP) was 1.5 kgCO2eq /L CPO and the total energy footprint (EFP) was 5.1 MJ/L CPO. The life cycle based cost is US$ 0.7/L of CPO and the largest cost comes from harvesting and transport (45%). The study uncovered many sustainability hotspots. The carbon hotspots were: methane emissions from waste water at the Oil Extraction stage, and fertilizer use from the Plantation Management stage. Fertilizer use is a key hotspot in all 3 areas: carbon, energy and economic cost. Given the plantation is only 5 years old, high consumption of fertilizer is expected. However, reducing N-fertilizers will help lower all three footprints. A sensitivity analysis shows that if the direct N2O emission factor was doubled, the CFP value at plantation stage could go as high as 49%, and the total CFP value could increase by 18%. If fertilizers were produced using modern technology, the total CFP value could go down by 13%, while the value at the plantation would go down by 29%. For methane emissions, the use of modern technologies to capture biogas from waste water has potential to reduce emissions significantly. Biofuel use at the Extraction stage is a win-win outcome with regard to carbon emissions, energy use and economic cost. However, biofuel use causes significant local environmental pollution and human health risks such as dark smoke and particulate matter. The bluewater footprint was 6.8 per L of CPO. Reduction of water consumption by increasing water efficiency at the extraction mills is important, because water extraction by mills is a serious threat to the local river basin. As a fraction of the total number of employees in the entire system, the highest labour use (68%) is at the Plantation Management stage. The analysis of smallholder farmers raises questions about the popular justification of palm oil plantations as a provider of rural employer and argues that indicators like community welfare and income inequality must be evaluated, because the extent to which the industry will enhance sustainable development depend on the way they combine with local communities, directly and indirectly.

TI  - An innovation platform for institutional change in Ghana's cocoa sector
T2  - CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB  - Cocoa is a major source of employment, smallholder farmers' incomes, and export revenue in Ghana. However, by 2010 institutional constraints throughout the value chain were failing to sustain bean quality and cocoa production. A national-level innovation platform, comprising key public and private actors in the cocoa sector, was established in 2010 to analyse and act to address this concern. The members' initial inquiries revealed that: farmers indirectly were paying for the national mass spraying and Hi-Tech input programmes, both provided free at the point of delivery. As the largest components in the cost structure, these programmes to a large extent accounted for the low price paid to farmers for their beans; a volatile exchange rate regime meant that often the prevailing rate was not equal to its equilibrium level; policies that heavily taxed cocoa were destroying farmers' expectation of long-term profitability. This paper draws on data recorded from the beginning 2009 to end 2013 by means of theory-guided process tracing (TGPT), to show how the platform contributed to increased prices for farmers, to subsequent reform of the input supply arrangements, and to changes to the mass spraying programme. The key causal mechanisms identified are policy learning and progressive amendment of existing institutions. The paper concludes by drawing lessons for the role of an innovation platform.

TI  - The role of collective action in leveraging farmers' performances: Lessons from sesame seed farmers' collaboration in eastern Chad
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - In recent decades, the role of farmers' associations in developing countries has been increasing due to a number of projects promoted by local and international governmental and non-governmental institutions and organizations. This paper analyses the effectiveness of collective action in enhancing farmers' market performances in terms of production quantity, production quality and profit. Specifically, the study points out the role of associations in leveraging smallholder market performance by providing learning, production and network support. In-depth interviews with local sesame value chain actors and a structural equation model based on a survey involving 97 farmers in East Chad are implemented. The farmers involved are part of the EU Project "Peanut and sesame food chain support: from production to marketing" led by a governmental organization. Results show that collective action supportive activities can effectively leverage farmers' market performances. Some policy implications for research and development organizations are finally discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Gendered Barriers and Opportunities for Women Smallholder Farmers in the Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia Vaccine Value Chain in Kenya
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary Small animals such as goats, sheep and chickens are an important source of income for rural livelihoods, especially for women farmers in Africa, because they are able to control the resources that come from the sale of these animals. However, one of the biggest problems they face is livestock diseases, even when vaccines are available. In Kenya, Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP) is a highly infectious disease of goats with a mortality rate of more than 70%. A vaccine for CCPP is available but difficult to access by women in the rural areas. This study examines the gaps and barriers that prevent women smallholder farmers from effectively accessing and adopting CCPP vaccination for their animals in the Machakos district of Kenya. Our results indicate that key constraints to vaccine access and adoption for rural smallholder women farmers are lack of a cold chain for vaccine maintenance, inadequate and late delivery of veterinary services, lack of information and training, and limited financial capacity to purchase the vaccine. If more resources, information, and training is made available to women smallholder farmers through government or the private sector, there would be improved livestock productivity, better livelihoods, and increased opportunities and agency for women. Most rural women smallholder farmers in Kenya generate income from the sale of small ruminant animals. However, diseases such as Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia (CCPP) prevent them from optimizing earnings. A crucial aspect for the control of CCPP is vaccination. In Kenya, CCPP vaccines are distributed through a government delivery mechanism. This study examines gaps and barriers that prevent women smallholder farmers from accessing CCPP vaccines. Qualitative data collection tools used were focus groups discussions, focus meals, jar voices and key informant interviews. Using outcome mapping (OM) methodology, critical partners and stakeholders in the CCPP vaccine value chain (CCPP-VVC) were identified to be the manufacturers, importers, distributors, agrovets, public and private veterinarians, local leaders, and farmers. Respondents highlighted the barriers to be limited access to vaccines due to cold chain problems, inadequate and late delivery of services, lack of information and training on vaccines, and financial constraints. Identified opportunities that can support women's engagement in the CCPP-VVC are the Kenya Governments two-third gender rule, which requires that not more than two thirds of the members of elective or appointive bodies shall be of the same gender, and positive community perception of female veterinarians. We conclude that more resources and training should be made available to women farmers, and that gender perspectives on policy development related to livestock production and disease prevention are urgently needed to improve livestock productivity and increase agency for women.

TI  - Using "theory of change" to improve agricultural research: recent experience from Tanzania
T2  - DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE
AB  - Demonstrating how agricultural research contributes to development outcomes is difficult but necessary given competing demands for scarce resources. This article summarises an adaptation of the "theory of change" approach and lessons derived from its application to improve the design and implementation of an agricultural research for development programme for greater impact. It was applied to Maziwa Zaidi, a programme that tested integrated interventions to catalyse the transformation of smallholder dairy value chains in Tanzania. Despite challenges, the approach was found useful for planning, communication, managing complexity, monitoring behavioural changes and deriving lessons to adapt future programme activities amid complexity and uncertainties.

TI  - Understanding drivers of private-sector compliance to large-scale food fortification: A case study on edible oil value chains in Bangladesh
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Micronutrient deficiency is a pertinent global challenge that affects billions of people and has deleterious health effects. Large-scale food fortification (LSFF) is a cost- effective way to tackle micronutrient deficiency and improve health outcomes, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the success of LSFF in LMICs is often hampered by limited compliance with fortification mandates by the private sector, who supply fortified foods. In this paper, we use a case study of the edible oil produced in Bangladesh to analyze the factors facilitating and impeding this compliance by for-profit actors. We identified four bottlenecks that disincentivize private sector actors' decision to comply. First, fortified and non-fortified products co-exist in the market, disincentivizing producers to invest in fortification. Second, the lack of traceability reduces the risk for large-scale producers' non-compliance with the regulation. Third, small-scale producers face economic pressures that prevent them from adequately fortifying oil products. Lastly, law enforcement is currently inconsistent, allowing the supply of under-fortified oil in the market. Given the evidence, we recommend to strengthen the control of bulk item fortification through more frequent and rigorous surveillance at the production level. This will ensure that resource constrained consumers who also have the greatest potential to benefit from added nutrients, remain able to access affordable and nutrient-enriched food.

TI  - Impact of contract farming on rice farm performance: Endogenous switching regression
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - Contract farming (CF) is increasing been used as a strategy in rice production in Ghana while there is no empirical data supporting it. This study investigated the importance of CF in rice production. Cross-sectional farm household level data collected from 350 rice farmers randomly selected across the rice production areas of Ghana was used. The adoption and casual impact of CF was estimated using endogenous switching regression and propensity score matching methods. Results revealed positive and significant relationship between CF and farm performance measures (yield and gross margins). Results indicate that, CF increases yield and gross margins significantly. It further identified educational level, rice farm size and ISFM as positive determinants of contract participation. This evidence provides strong support for efforts to promote CF in Ghana. Educated farmers should be targeted for CF participation because their propensity to participate in CF is high. Sensitising our illiterate farmers to participate in CF should be vigorously pursued. CF should also be encouraged as a means to promote the adoption of ISFM technology. CF is recommended as a good tool for developing the local rice value chain in Ghana.

TI  - The triple burden: the impact of time poverty on women's participation in coffee producer organizational governance in Mexico
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - In the mid-1990s, fairtrade-organic registration data showed that only 9 % of Oaxaca, Mexico's organic coffee 'farm operators' were women; by 2013 the female farmer rate had increased to 42 %. Our research investigates the impact of this significant increase in women's coffee association participation among 210 members of two coffee producer associations in Oaxaca, Mexico. We find that female coffee organization members report high levels of household decision-making power and they are more likely than their male counterparts to report control over their coffee income. These significant advances in women's agency within the household are offset by the fact that the women experience significant time poverty as they engage in coffee production while bearing a disproportionate share of domestic labor obligations. The women coffee producers view organizational labor as a third burden on their time, after their reproductive and productive labor. The time poverty they experience limits their ability to fully participate in coffee organizational governance and consequently there are few women leaders at all levels of the coffee producer businesses. This is problematic because it limits women's ability to fully benefit from organizational membership: when women fully participate in governance they gain valuable business and leadership skills and producer associations with active female members may also be more likely to develop and maintain programs and policies that enhance gender equity. Our findings indicate that targeted agricultural development programs to improve gender equity among agricultural smallholders should involve creative ways to ease women's labor burdens and reduce their time poverty in order to facilitate full organizational participation. The research findings fill a gap in existing studies of agricultural global value chains (GVCs) by demonstrating how the certified coffee GVC depends on women's under and un-paid labor not only within the household but also within producer organizations.

TI  - Hidden assets: Asia's smallholder wood resources and their contribution to supply chains of commercial wood
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY
AB  - Influenced by increasing population and prosperity, global wood needs are expected to treble by 2050, and an increased dependence on plantations will see demand for planted wood grow from 500 Mm(3) to 1500 Mm(3) over the next 30 years. Expansion of planted wood resources using conventional commercial plantation models is challenged in the crowded landscapes of Asia, where land tenure, access and ownership are ambiguous and it is unlikely that conventional plantations will be able to expand to meet demand.
   Forest assets managed by smallholder tree-farmers already make substantial contributions to national forest assets, wood production, exports and national incomes, and their role in wood production will become increasingly critical to meeting society's needs. Benefits arising from the raw materials they produce are largely unrecognised in official statistics, partly because the many thousands of small stands of trees are widely scattered and flexibly managed by numerous treefarmers as 'living bank accounts', being strongly influenced by emergency needs for immediate cash to satisfy family and social obligations.
   Using available data and credible assumptions, the probable contributions of smallholder assets to national economies and smallholder livelihoods have been calculated for acacias in Vietnam and eucalypts in Guangxi Province, China, along with smallholder contributions to commercial wood flows in several other Asian countries.
   More than 600 000 ha (equivalent) of unaccounted acacia smallholdings and informal plantings in Vietnam, annually produce more than 9 Mm(3) of wood worth (as export woodchips) in excess of US $500 M. In Guangxi, commercial smallholder forest stands amount to about 800 000 ha of eucalypts, and produce in excess of 12 Mm(3) of wood annually. This Chinese resource generates considerable employment and raw materials to industry worth over US$2.4 bn (bn; 1bn = 1 000 000 000) after local primary processing. In India, sales of commercial logs grown by smallholders add over US$700 M annually to rural economies and similar examples are offered for Lao PDR, Indonesia and Thailand.
   The numerous opportunities and impediments in smallholder forestry are discussed, with consequences for national policies. The role of traders within the forest products value chain is examined, and forest certification and the burden of compliance with complicated and onerous laws and regulations are discussed. Smallholder tree-farmers are entrepreneurs who expect their investments in smallholdings to produce financial (and other) benefits. Collectively, they represent multi-billion-dollar regional businesses, increasing incomes for many millions of households and creating significant national assets. To succeed, smallholder tree-farmers need the conditions summarised in 2001 as Byron's 'Four Keys': (i) clear ownership of trees; (ii) reliable markets; (iii) sympathetic legal and regulatory frameworks; and (iv) a robust package of technical options. Reliable value chains and risk mitigation are important issues, and severe impediments in any of the 'Four Keys' jeopardise the efficiency and effectiveness of the forest products value chain, the livelihoods and financial sustainability of the smallholder tree-farmers, and their substantial contributions to national productivity and forest assets.

TI  - Mobilising common biocultural heritage for the socioeconomic inclusion of small farmers: panarchy of two case studies on quinoa in Chile and Bolivia
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - Valorising the biocultural heritage of common goods could enable peasant farmers to achieve socially and economically inclusive sustainability. Increasingly appreciated by consumers, peasant heritage products offer small farmers promising opportunities for economic, social and territorial development. Identifying the obstacles and levers of this complex, multi-scale and multi-stakeholder objective requires an integrative framework. We applied the panarchy conceptual framework to two cases of participatory research with small quinoa producers: a local fair in Chile and quinoa export production in Bolivia. In both cases, the "commoning" process was crucial both to bring stakeholders together inside their communities and to gain outside recognition for their production and thus achieve social and economic inclusion. Despite the differences in scale, the local fair and the export market shared a similar marketing strategy based on short value chains promoting quality products with high identity value. In these dynamics of biocultural heritage valorisation, the panarchical approach revealed the central place as well as the vulnerability of the community territory. As a place of both anchoring and opening, the community territory is the privileged space where autonomous and consensual control over the governance of common biocultural resources can be exercised.

TI  - Soil technology and post-harvest losses in Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - PurposePost-harvest losses are becoming a huge issue worldwide and are predominantly severe in developing countries. Seeking ways to control post-harvest losses is important because losses decrease farm income by more than 15% for approximately 480 million small-scale farmers.Design/methodology/approachThe study engaged Wave 4 (2018/2019) of the Living Standards Measurement Studies-Integrated Survey on Agriculture, to examine the impact of soil technology such as fertilisers, herbicides, pesticides and certified crops on post-harvest losses in Nigeria. The study engaged descriptive statistics, logit regression and propensity score matching (PSM) to analyse the data.FindingsThe study found that approximately 38% of the household harvest was lost along the value chain. In addition, the results showed that among the indicators of soil technology, crop certification has a significant impact on the reduction of post-harvest losses. The implication is that from the nearest neighbour and kernel-based matching, the use of certified crops by households contributed to 1.62 and 1.36% reduction in post-harvest losses, respectively. In contrast, pesticide, herbicide and fertiliser use had no significant impact on post-harvest losses.Research limitations/implicationsOne of the limitations is that this study applied the PSM, the model did not account for endogeneity. Therefore, in examining this concept, further studies should consider applying other impact model such as the difference-in-difference to account for endogeneity.Originality/valueWhile previous studies have examined how ICT adoption, storage mechanisms and value chain among others help to minimise post-harvest losses, the aspect of how soil technology can reduce post-harvest losses has been a subject of exclusion in the extant literature. This study empirically examines the impact of soil technology adoption on post-harvest losses in Nigeria.

TI  - GOOD FOR WHOM? SUPERMARKETS AND SMALL FARMERS IN SOUTH AFRICA - A CRITICAL REVIEW OF CURRENT APPROACHES TO INCREASING ACCESS TO MODERN MARKETS
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - Small-scale agriculture is one of the few tools available to support improved rural livelihoods on a significant scale in South Africa. Access to output markets is a key factor in generating higher incomes. The rise of modern markets (supermarkets in particular) is generally viewed as positive for the rural poor, although most commentators accede that there are challenges to be overcome in obtaining access to such markets. These challenges are generally perceived as supply-side issues: That is, the "fault" for market exclusion lies largely with small producers their production methods, their business organisation and their location - rather than with these markets themselves. This study asserts that much of the research that has been undertaken in this area is in fact incomplete, because it has excluded two key issues: The likely impact of the dominant supermarket business model on small farmers; and the actual position of small farmers in those countries with high levels of supermarket concentration. A closer examination of the supermarket model suggests it is inherently hostile towards smaller producers. The South African food retail market structure resembles that of industrialised countries rather than developing countries. Therefore, we should expect that the position of South African small farmers vis-a-vis supermarkets is similar to that of small farmers in industrialised countries, who are increasingly excluded from these value chains.

TI  - Perceptions and outlook on intercropping coffee with banana as an opportunity for smallholder coffee farmers in Uganda
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Coffee and banana are important cash and food crops in Uganda and the surrounding East African highland region. Production is dominated by smallholders that have limited arable land and often coffee and banana are intercropped. No significant research and development efforts have been undertaken over the last few decades on this coffee/banana intercropping system. Because recent studies suggest that this system could be a practice with high benefits to the farmers, we decided to study the perceptions of stakeholders along the coffee value chain starting with farmers. Perception analysis based on open-ended interviews following interview guides revealed that a major limitation for the sustainability of this system was poor soil fertility conditions. Perceptions on the benefits of intercropping differed little among coffee actors; that is, banana intercropping provides additional food and income from smallholders' limited land and helps farmers reduce risks related to drought, pest/disease attacks and coffee price volatility. However, farmers' desire to minimize risks does not match the objective of stakeholders higher up the coffee value chain to maximize coffee production. Furthermore, research by public institutes, both national and international, is primarily organized for single crops and not systems. We conclude that the institutional setting of the coffee sector hampers the promotion of intercropping, despite the benefits for the farmer.

TI  - Cashmere producing smallholder nomads of Himalaya: Survival challenges of a system
T2  - SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH
CP  - 12th International Goat Conference (ICG)
AB  - Cold arid region of Himalaya is famous for Changthangi Cashmere (Pashmina) producing breed of goats reared under transhumance production system. Breeding tract of Changhthang spans from the Chinese province of Quinghai in the East across central and North Tibet to Ladakh (India) in the West with an altitude of 3700-4500 m amsl and wide seasonal/diurnal fluctuating temperature (35 C to 40 C). Two field studies were conducted with objectives to assess performance, livelihood security, pastoral nomadism, value chain and survival challenges of Cashmere goat based smallholder production system. Multistage stratified random, probability proportional to size sampling, project evaluation, growth models, and constraint analysis techniques were used to synthesise the results based on data collected from 350 nomadic households rearing 25,659 goats in three zones of Changthang with variable altitudes. Results reveal altitude, demographic trend, flock structure and size, sex, age and grade of Cashmere exhibited statistically significant high correlation (r > 0.80) between altitudes and flock size vis-a-vis fibre quality. Important contributing factor for quality fibre diameter (<= 14 mu) turned to be cold aridity, altitude >= 4000 m asl and availability of quality pastures. Cashmere yield was recorded highest in castrated bucks (585 g) and lowest in does (385 g) with body weight highest in castrated (30 kg) and lower in breeding bucks (27 kg). Overall, Cashmere production and breed population showed growth (CAGR) of 3.7% and 4.94%, respectively with BCR (2.72:1), IRR (1843.17%), NPV (INR 72.14) and payback period of one year, indicating the viability of the production system. In the value chain, brilliantly coloured feather weight Cashmere shawls, rumal and stoles handcrafted from the fibre with 20 times value addition annually realised around INR 1679 million (USD 24.70 million) revenue besides generating employment of 3.56 million mandays. Constraint analysis indicate survival challenges of the production system and the study flags policy options to arrest diseases, high inbreeding, winter malnutrition, kid mortality, trans -boundary hostility, onslaught of fake products besides infrastructure deficits in Changthang.

TI  - Inclusiveness revisited: Assessing inclusive businesses in South African agriculture
T2  - DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB  - Inclusive businesses are complex partnerships between commercial entities and smallholders/low-income communities, to include the latter in commercial agricultural value chains. IBs offer income opportunities for both partners, but are also regarded as empowering the smallholders/communities. To date, IB inclusiveness has been assessed mainly through basic quantitative measurements. However, these measures neglect the complexities of the overall value creation process, and of the inclusion of the beneficiaries within this process. This paper aims at providing a more holistic methodology by assessing the level of inclusiveness based on four dimensions: ownership, voice, risk and reward. Case studies in South Africa show that inclusion of low-income communities lags behind the intended level. Lack of financial resources and skills, reinforced by power imbalance, result in smallholder ownership being limited to land, the community's voice being compromised, risk being transferred to the smallholder communities and rewards being disappointing for the beneficiaries.

TI  - Exploring the integration of business and CSR perspectives in smallholder souring: Black soybean in Indonesia and tomato in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of smallholder supply chains on sustainable sourcing to answer the question how food and agribusiness multinationals can best include smallholders in their sourcing strategies and take social responsibility for large-scale sustainable and more equitable supply. A sustainable smallholder sourcing model with a list of critical success factors (CSFs) has been applied on two best-practise cases. In this model, business and corporate social responsibility perspectives are integrated.
   Design/methodology/approach The primary data of the value chain analyses of the two smallholder supply chains of a food and agribusiness multinational have been applied. Both cases were of a join research program commissioned by the multinational and a non-governmental organization using the same methods and research tools. Similarities, differences and interference between the cases have been determined and assessed in order to confirm, fine tune or adjust the CSFs.
   Findings Both cases could be conceptualized through the smallholder sourcing model. Most CSFs could be found in both cases, but differences were also found, which led to fine tuning of some CSFs: building of a partnership and effective producers organization, providing farm financing and the use of cross-functional teams in smallholder supplier development programs. It was also concluded that the smallholder sourcing model is applicable in different geographical areas.
   Research limitations/implications The findings of this study are based on just two cases. More best-practise cases are recommended in order to confirm or to adjust the developed sourcing model and the CSFs.
   Originality/value This paper/research fills the need in sustainable supply chain management literature to study supply chains that comply with the triple bottom line concept, rather than supply chains that are just more green.

TI  - Institutional arrangements of outgrower sugarcane production in Southern Africa
T2  - DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB  - Management models are needed that empower local communities to produce biofuel feedstock in a manner that drives rural development. Much can be learnt through the accumulated experiences of sugarcane outgrower schemes in southern Africa. Early schemes provided limited empowerment, but protected outgrowers from the risks of volatile sugar value chains. In later schemes, processing plants were responsible for all operations and simply paid dividends to participating farmers. More recent schemes offer full ownership, which comes with greater rewards and empowerment, but also exposure to risks. The underlying institutional structures of outgrower schemes largely dictate their performance, and thus the factors that affect their viability or collapse. To understand the different institutional arrangements of sugarcane outgrower schemes we undertake a comparative analysis of 13 schemes in southern Africa employing a political economy framework that uses the three key questions: who owns what', who does what', and who gets what'.

TI  - Corporate social responsibility and the role of rural women in strengthening agriculture-tourism linkages in Nigeria's oil producing communities
T2  - JOURNAL OF TOURISM AND CULTURAL CHANGE
AB  - This paper extends and contributes to the literature on tourism for transformative and inclusive growth from the corporate social responsibility (CSR) perspective. Specifically, we examine the impact of CSR of multinational oil companies (MOCs) on empowerment of rural women in strengthening agriculture-tourism linkages in Niger Delta region of Nigeria. A total of 800 rural women were sampled across the region. Results from the use of a logit model indicates that rural women seldom participate in the global memorandum of understandings (GMoUs) interventions in agritourism value chain projects, due to the norms and culture of the rural communities. This implies that if the tradition of the people continues to hinder direct participation of the rural women from GMoUs programmes, achieving gender equality and cultural change would be limited in the region, and rural women would remain excluded from the economic benefits of agritourism when compared with the male counterparts. The finding suggests that, GMoU interventions engaging women smallholders in the tourism value chain can be important vehicle for advancing gender empowerment and fostering social inclusion. Also, cluster development boards (CDBs) should pay close attention to which extent the participation of rural women in the GMoUs projects may be limited by traditions.

TI  - Peasant agency in Ghana's oil palm sector: The impact of multiple markets on food sovereignty
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE
AB  - This paper contributes to the debate on peasant differentiation and market integration in the food sovereignty literature by examining the smallholder-oriented oil palm sector in Ghana's eastern region. Against the background of loosening entry barriers in global value chains, and through an analysis of farmers' different positions in palm oil's multiple markets, we witness peasant-like patterning of production and strategic market participation among well-situated non-contract farmers. We propose that such interface settings where commodity relations are present, but do not penetrate fully offer valuable entry points for revisiting the role of global markets in peasant reproduction in the Global South. We consequently argue the need to replace the idealized category of "peasant" with an analytical category that can recognize social differentiation and reproduction through partial engagement with commodity markets.

TI  - Adapting the WEAI to explore gender equity among Fishers, Processors, and sellers at Zambia's Lake Bangweulu
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We implemented the novel Women's Empowerment in Fisheries Index (WEFI) (adapted from the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index), among men and women fisheries value chain actors at Zambia's Lake Bangweulu (N = 397). We found significant gender disparities favoring males across key indicators. Men were significantly more likely to report large decision-making input into fishing, processing, transporting, and selling fish, as well as sole ownership of important productive assets such as fishing and processing equipment, canoes, and mobile phones. Women were significantly more likely to report non-completion of any years of school and being "not at all comfortable" speaking in public on decisions affecting their fishing community, on decisions related to fishery governance, and to protest illegal/unsustainable fishing practices. Women were also significantly more likely to report that - in the past four weeks - there was no food to eat in their dwelling due to lack of resources to get food, they/another household member had gone to sleep at night hungry because there was not enough food, and they/another household member had gone a whole day and night without eating because there was not enough food. For the gender attitude questions, a sizeable proportion of both men and women disagreed that men should retain control of fishery assets, income, and decision-making. However, these opinions were not reflected in the current distribution of fishery assets, income, and decision-making autonomy. The results indicate that the WEFI is a useful quantitative instrument, as it is relatively brief while also allowing for gender-disaggregated analysis of demographic characteristics, household-level hunger, livelihoods participation, asset ownership, decision-making autonomy, and gender attitudes specific to small-scale capture fishery value chain actors. Replicating the WEFI among small-scale fisheries value chain actors in other sub-Saharan countries will provide important insights on gender equity commonalities and differences across sites/contexts.

TI  - An Economic Exploration of Smallholder Value Chains: Coffee Transactions in Chiapas, Mexico
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Fair trade and vertical integration represent two popular approaches for enhancing the incomes of organized farmers in a volatile coffee market as compared to the uncertain plight of independent, non-affiliated growers. A mixed method approach, utilizing informal interviews and a household survey in Chiapas, Mexico, analyzed three coffee trading regimes: independent, non-affiliated farmers, and growers in cooperatives pursuing a fair trade or vertical integration strategy. Survey and econometric results indicate that concentration on specialty coffee production with a portfolio of foreign contracts is economically preferable to a vertically integrated cooperative, which in turn produces more favorable coffee prices for smallholders than the non-affiliated conventional, coyote-dominated trading system.

TI  - STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF DAIRY PRODUCTION SYSTEMS IN FAISALABAD, PAKISTAN AS BASIS FOR THEIR EFFICIENT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB  - Qualitative and semi-quantitative data from 139 interviews with farmers in Faisalabad, Pakistan, was subjected to cluster analysis to identify homogenous groups of farms regarding production strategies, milk yields and marketing. Four distinct production systems were identified. Semi-commercial smallholder-mixed systems (SSM; 31%) combined crop and livestock production, and fodder was primarily produced for own livestock. Semi-commercial smallholder dairy producers (SSD; 21.6%) had few buffaloes and cattle and low income. Commercial smallholder dairy producers (CSD; 37.4%) were mostly well-off and produced substantial quantities of milk year-round. Commercial large-holder dairy farms (CLD; 10%) showed the highest input and output levels. In all systems, most of the produced milk was sold in the increasing order of percentage (SSM: 69%, SSD: 69%, CSD: 87%; CLD: 94%). Negligence in breeding, wastage of high yielding buffaloes, high costs of feedstuffs, an unfavorable marketing system and lack of a diversified dairy value chain were the main constraints for all production systems. Improving efficiency of the resources usage; especially with respect to animal genetics and nutrition, should be encouraged in dairy farmers of Faisalabad as well as other major cities in Pakistan to produce milk upto the maximum potential of their animals. This could satisfy the need of milk production for sale, serving both the increasing urban demand for milk, as well as income generation for the farmers. To this end farmers' endeavors must be supported by initiatives from government and private bodies.

TI  - Unleashing the social capital of self-help groups for strengthening seed systems in Uttar Pradesh, India
T2  - GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Women's empowerment and varietal replacement of crops are often unconnected domains in agricultural development; an experience connecting both in India has global potential. Rajiv Gandhi Mahila Vikas Pariyojana, a women's empowerment and poverty reduction program in Uttar Pradesh, embedded seed practices within the collective structure of women's self-help groups. Through collective efforts, women became successful in the production and dissemination of quality seed of new rice and wheat varieties, reaching more than 30,000 smallscale farmers. They appropriated several components of the seed value chain; their social capital became instrumental in varietal replacement. The self-perception of women as knowledgeable farmers changed, as did the perception of household and community members; therefore, seed activities contributed to intrinsic women's empowerment.

TI  - Cash rather than contract: The re-emergence of traditional agrifood chains in post-communist Europe
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Usually considered the polar, informal opposite of the "modern procurement system" dominated by supermarkets, the "traditional system" has received only scarce attention in post-communist countries, even though it is credited with having had supplied most of the food produced in the largest countries throughout transition. This paper asks how did traditional agrifood chains re-emerge, in particular since "tradition" is hard to define in the post-communist context. It focuses on the role of land reform, the mixed-incomes rural household, and the farmer-trader dyad in explaining the return of the "traditional" in two post-communist countries, Ukraine and Romania. Data comes from an ethnographic study of agricultural value chains in the Ukrainian-Romanian border region of Bucovina. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Rural energy transitions in developing countries: a case of the Uttam Urja initiative in India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - In most developing countries, at the household level, traditional burning of biomass or use of inefficient technologies for domestic applications like lighting is common, triggering concerns related to fuel or technology switching. The paper focuses on opportunities to promote cleaner energy options through development of value chains delivering improved energy efficiency and access in developing countries. We discuss the example of Uttam Urja, a field project involving the dissemination of photovoltaic lighting technologies in rural areas of India. We focus on the challenges of introducing radical innovations into the residential energy sector in developing countries. For the purpose of this paper the Uttam Urja project is conceptualized as an 'experiment' and analysed using the Strategic Niche Management (SNM) framework. The paper emphasizes that to effect socio-technical transitions to clean energy options on the ground, it is desirable to focus on technology customization and innovative financing to cater to the needs and concerns of end users.

TI  - Impact of the eKutir ICT-enabled social enterprise and its distributed microentrepreneur strategy on fruit and vegetable consumption: A quasi-experimental study in rural and urban communities in Odisha, India
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - This paper reports results of a quasi-experimental study designed to assess the impact of an information and communication technology (ICT)-enabled ecosystem, led by the social enterprise eKutir, on household fruit and vegetable consumption in Odisha, India. eKutir aims at providing self-sustaining solutions to poverty and undernutrition in developing countries by leveraging ICTs through ecosystem development anchored into a distributed micro-entrepreneurial strategy. eKutir's farming micro-entrepreneurs (FME) provide agricultural knowledge, inputs, and market linkages at household and community level, followed by progressive integration of other micro-entrepreneurs at different points along the value chain on both supply and demand sides. The present case examined core FMEs along with retail micro-entrepreneurs (RMEs) deployed in low-resource rural and urban communities. Structural equation modeling was used to compare rural outcomes and the role of homegrown consumption as a mediator. Multivariable linear regression and ANOVA were used to test group differences in the urban sample. Positive beta coefficients represent an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption in communities exposed to the eKutir ecosystem in contrast to the comparison group. Farmers in rural communities exposed to the eKutir ecosystem consumed more overall fruit and vegetables (beta = 0.30, p < 0.001) and fruits alone (beta = 0.53, p < 0.05) than those farmers in comparison villages unexposed to the eKutir ecosystem. This effect was concentrated in households exposed to both FMEs + RMEs (beta = 0.60, p < 0.0001) and was mediated by homegrown consumption. A non-significant directional effect was observed in comparing fruit and vegetable consumption in rural households exposed to RMEs only over comparison communities. Urban consumers, exposed to the eKutir ecosystem through access to RMEs operating in their neighborhood community, did not increase their fruit or vegetable consumption compared to non-intervention communities. The results reveal the potential of reaching nutritional impacts through homegrown consumption and with farm-level support outside of governmental/philanthropic interventions through an ICT-enabled social enterprise. They also underscore, however, the challenges of both changing eating behaviour and intervening along the agri-food value chain. Implication for more effective digital ecosystem design and intersectoral policies are discussed.

TI  - Do Private Sustainability Standards Contribute to Income Growth and Poverty Alleviation ? A Comparison of Different Coffee Certification Schemes in Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Private sustainability standards are increasingly important in food trade with developing countries, but the implications for smallholder farmers are still poorly understood. We analyze the implications of different coffee certification schemes in Ethiopia using cross-sectional survey data, and regression and propensity-score-matching techniques. We find that: Rainforest Alliance (RA) and double Fairtrade-Organic (FT-Org) certifications are associated with higher incomes and reduced poverty, mainly because of higher prices; Fairtrade (FT) certification hardly affects welfare; and Organic (Org) certification reduces incomes, chiefly due to lower yields. Cooperative heterogeneity importantly shapes these results. Results imply that private standards may not always deliver what they promise to consumers.

TI  - The impact of an integrated value chain intervention on household poultry production in Burkina Faso: evidence from a randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS
AB  - This article reports on a cluster-randomised controlled trial conducted in rural Burkina Faso evaluating a multifaceted intervention, SELEVER, that seeks to increase poultry production by delivering training and strengthening of village-level institutions providing veterinary and credit services. Households exposed to the intervention significantly increase their use of poultry inputs (veterinary services, enhanced feeds, and deworming), and report more poultry sold and higher revenue. However, there is no evidence of an increase in profits. This evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the return to inputs may not be sufficient to counterbalance the market costs of these inputs.

TI  - Risk factors associated with Salmonella spp. prevalence along smallholder pig value chains in Vietnam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of, and risk factors for, Salmonella contamination along the smallholder pig value chain in northern Vietnam. Repeat cross-sectional (for farm and pork shops) and longitudinal (for slaughterhouses) studies were carried out in Hung Yen and Nghe An provinces in four sampling periods over a year (April 2014 to February 2015).
   In total, 72 pig farms and 217 pork shops were visited during the period, and 13 slaughterhouses were visited four times. Information on management and hygiene practices was collected using checklists and questionnaires, and risk factor analyses at the farm, slaughterhouse, and pork shop levels were performed using generalized mixed-effects models with the significant levels 10%.
   Salmonella prevalence was 36.1%, 38.9%, and 44.7% on pig pen floors, pig carcasses in slaughterhouses, and cut pork in pork shops, respectively. The risk factor for Salmonella prevalence on pig pen floors were having a pig pen next to a household (p = 0.06) and free access to the farm by visitors (p = 0.06). Our slaughterhouse model found a single risk factor for carcass contamination: slaughter area close to lairage without hygienic measures (p = 0.03). For pork shops, presence of flies or insects on pork at shop (p = 0.02) and use of a cloth at pork shop (p = 0.02) were risk factors. The Salmonella prevalence on pig carcass and cut pork was significantly lower in winter compared to that in other seasons. Our study results highlighted the need of improving farm hygiene at farm level, and pork hygiene practices to avoid cross-contamination at the slaughterhouse and market levels, to reduce the risk of salmonellosis through pork consumption in northern Vietnam.

TI  - Market participation, household food security, and income: The case of cowpea producers in northern Nigeria
T2  - FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY
AB  - This article evaluates the impact of cowpea market participation on household food security and income in northern Nigeria. Using household survey data from a representative sample of over 1,500 farm households and applying a combination of instrumental variable techniques and dose-response functions, we found that cowpea market participation had a statistically significant positive impact on household food security and income. Cowpea market participation increased food expenditure by 1.6% and household income by 0.7% with a 10 unit increase in the quantity of cowpea sold. These results underscore the importance of cowpea market participation for household food security and income improvement. We also found that selling cowpea to rural and urban traders significantly increased household income, food expenditure, and food security. Results show that selling cowpea to rural and urban traders increased household income by 17% and 13%, respectively. The results point to the need for an enabling policy environment and public infrastructure to enhance market participation of farmers and traders. Public infrastructure investments in the form of feeder road construction and maintenance in the distant villages are encouraged, which in the long run can translate into improved cowpea productivity and welfare of smallholder farmers.

TI  - Jatropha Developments in Mozambique: Analysis of Structural Conditions Influencing Niche-Regime Interactions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This article investigates the transition dynamics related to Jatropha developments in Mozambique. The analysis focuses on how structural conditions (infrastructure, institutions, interaction and collaboration and capabilities and resources) enable or constrain interactions between niche-level Jatropha experiments and incumbent energy, agriculture and rural development regimes in Mozambique. Investors in agro-industrial Jatropha projects focused on establishing projects in areas with relatively good infrastructure, rather than in remote rural areas. Furthermore, they predominantly focused on Jatropha production instead of investing in the entire Jatropha value chain, which turned out to be a challenge in itself, as growing a productive Jatropha crop was much more complex than initially anticipated. The development of institutions that could nurture and protect Jatropha projects from the prevailing regimes lagged behind Jatropha project establishment, leading to an insecure investment climate. Strong inter-ministerial collaboration and organized civil society interaction and representation contrasted with non-organized private sector and rather isolated smallholder Jatropha projects. The global financial crisis and limited adaptive capacity reduced the time and space for experimentation and learning to overcome disappointing crop performance. Together, this hampered Jatropha's potential to challenge the energy, agricultural and rural development regimes. Nevertheless, the Jatropha experience did initiate the development of policy and regulation and stimulated interaction and collaboration between specific groups of stakeholders, which could provide the basis to capture future biofuel momentum in Mozambique.

AB  - Using farm-level data from dairy farmers in India's Bihar state and the two-stage residual inclusion method, this study investigates the impact of the adoption of food safety measures (FSMs) on milk yield and profitability of smallholder dairy farms. This study reveals that herd size and experience in dairy farming have a significant effect on the number of FSMs smallholders adopt. An additional FSM increases milk yield by about 1% and profitability by about 2.3%. An extra year of education increases yield and profits by about 3.8% and 4.9%, respectively. The government could design and incentivize policies that help increase herd size and promote better housing conditions for animals, thus promoting the uptake of FSMs and increased milk yield and profitability.

TI  - CONTRACT FARMING AND FOOD SECURITY
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Contract farming has often been associated with an increase in the income of participating households. It is unclear, however, whether contract farming increases other aspects of household welfare. We use data from six regions of Madagascar and a selection-on-observables design in which we control for a household's marginal utility of participating in contract farming, which we elicited via a contingent valuation experiment, to show that participating in contract farming reduces the duration of a household's hungry season by about eight days on average. Moreover, participation in contract farming makes participating households about 18% more likely to see their hungry season end at any time. Further, we find that these effects are more pronounced for households with more children, and for households with more girls. This is an important result as children-especially girls-often bear the burden of food insecurity.

TI  - Effect of market information quality, sharing and utilisation on the innovation behaviour of smallholder pig producers
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - Although pig farming can accelerate Uganda's economic development, the value chain is undeveloped with poorly organized informal markets. Buyers take advantage of farmers paying low prices, pointing to the poor quality of pigs and pork. Farmer innovation can remedy this situation by enabling farmers to reduce costs, improve pig productivity and quality of pigs and pork. Leveraging farmer innovation behaviour calls for appropriate agricultural information. However, the effect of market information quality, sharing, and utilization on the innovation behaviour of pig producing farmers is not fully known. This study sought to determine the effect of information quality, sharing, and utilisation on the innovation behaviour of pig producing farmers in Northern Uganda. A cross-section survey of 239 respondents selected through multiple stages of purposive and random sampling was done. Data were analysed by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results show that information quality contributes significantly to innovation behaviour directly (beta = 0.247; P < 0.01) as well as indirectly through the partial mediation of information utilization (beta = 0.176; 95% CI = 0.040 similar to 0.349). Therefore, interventions that seek to enhance smallholder farmer innovation should provide quality information and support farmers to utilise it.

TI  - Do environmentally-friendly cocoa farms yield social and economic co-benefits?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Downstream companies in chocolate supply chains are increasingly engaged in improving the sustainability of cocoa production, which requires a multidimensional understanding of cocoa farms' sustainability performance. However, prior research has insufficiently addressed the multiple sustainability dimensions of cocoa production or the interrelationships between dimensions. This study explores farm sustainability using our comprehensive data set of 395 cocoa farms in Ecuador and Uganda and identifies social and economic co-benefits and trade-offs of environmentally-friendly cocoa production. For this, farms were grouped according to environmental performance and then compared. This approach revealed lowest sustainability performance in the social and governance dimension. We identified important social and economic co-benefits of environmentally-friendly cocoa production regarding human health benefits from reduced pesticide use and resource conservation for farms' long-term productivity, although at the expense of farm investments and profitability. Future interventions require approaches that target underrepresented sustainability issues and enable synergistic effects between environmental, social, and economic sustainability for cocoa farms.

TI  - The influence of multilevel innovation platforms on continuing utilization of smallholders' livestock feeding practices
T2  - INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Agricultural research for development agencies in sub-Saharan Africa increasingly implements innovation platforms (IPs) to address institutional barriers to innovation in smallholder agriculture. This research aims to understand the activities, actions or arrangements that were mediated by a multilevel set of IPs to sustain the use of livestock feeding practices in the Ethiopian Highlands. Data was collected two years after the multilevel IPs had been phased out to ascertain if innovation outcomes had been sustained beyond the life of the project. The study identified specific IP interventions that constrained or enabled sustained use of the livestock innovations among two groups of smallholders based on their livestock production objective, i.e., commercially oriented or subsistence. Where the feed innovations had been tailored to specific enterprises and aligned to farmers' production goals, such as improved dairy farming, they were sustained. Transitioning to a livestock feed system was enabled in the case of commercially oriented smallholders and remained a challenge for subsistence-oriented smallholders, especially where access to forage seeds and affordable input services is limited. Finally mechanisms and strategies to inform similar future interventions to support the development of different groups of farmers along the value chain to achieve impact beyond project period are presented.

TI  - Distribution, Harvesting, and Trade of Yartsa Gunbu (Ophiocordyceps sinensis) in the Sikkim Himalaya, India
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Cordyceps has significantly improved the socioeconomic status of the mountain people in the Sikkim Himalaya, India, but an upsurge in demand and its price has resulted in overexploitation and degradation of the fragile alpine habitat in which it grows. This study aimed to shed light on the distribution, resource abundance, harvesting practices, commercialization, and trade of Cordyceps through household surveys and open-ended interviews with the collectors, sublocal and local traders, and local officials. Significant differences (p < 0.001) in average collection and income per household were observed. The income from Cordyceps ranged from US$ 0.03 to 0.23 million for the 3 villages studied. We conclude that there is a strong need to understand the market of Cordyceps and develop the value chain to regulate its price in Sikkim.

TI  - Policy impact assessment in developing countries using Social Accounting Matrices: The Kenya SAM 2014
T2  - REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper describes the structure and estimation of a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) of Kenya for the year 2014. Among its specificities, this SAM includes a very high disaggregation of the agri-food sector and accounts for the double role of households as producers and consumers. Accounting for these characteristics is crucial to provide robust socioeconomic analysis in the context of developing countries. Indeed, this type of database is valuable to perform ex-ante evaluations of economic policies with various economic models and techniques. In this paper, we present an application with a linear multiplier analysis (backward linkages and value chain decomposition). The results show the capacity of the primary sector in Kenya to generate value added and employment, with this growth distributed more intensely in rural households whose main livelihood is semi-subsistence agriculture.

TI  - Application of system dynamics and participatory spatial group model building in animal health: A case study of East Coast Fever interventions in Lundazi and Monze districts of Zambia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - East Coast Fever (ECF) is the most economically important production disease among traditional beef cattle farmers in Zambia. Despite the disease control efforts by the government, donors, and farmers, ECF cases are increasing. Why does ECF oscillate over time? Can alternative approaches such as systems thinking contribute solutions to the complex ECF problem, avoid unintended consequences, and achieve sustainable results? To answer these research questions and inform the design and implementation of ECF interventions, we qualitatively investigated the influence of dynamic socio-economic, cultural, and ecological factors. We used system dynamics modelling to specify these dynamics qualitatively, and an innovative participatory framework called spatial group model building (SGMB). SGMB uses participatory geographical information system (GIS) concepts and techniques to capture the role of spatial phenomenon in the context of complex systems, allowing stakeholders to identify spatial phenomenon directly on physical maps and integrate such information in model development. Our SGMB process convened focus groups of beef value chain stakeholders in two distinct production systems. The focus groups helped to jointly construct a series of interrelated system dynamics models that described ECF in a broader systems context. Thus, a complementary objective of this study was to demonstrate the applicability of system dynamics modelling and SGMB in animal health. The SGMB process revealed policy leverage points in the beef cattle value chain that could be targeted to improve ECF control. For example, policies that develop sustainable and stable cattle markets and improve household income availability may have positive feedback effects on investment in animal health. The results obtained from a SGMB process also demonstrated that a "one-size-fits-all" approach may not be equally effective in policing ECF in different agro-ecological zones due to the complex interactions of socio-ecological context with important, and often ignored, spatial patterns.

TI  - Irrigation development in Zimbabwe: understanding productivity barriers and opportunities at Mkoba and Silalatshani irrigation schemes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Productivity barriers and opportunities influencing smallholder irrigation sustainability in Zimbabwe were identified using case studies of the Silalatshani and Mkoba irrigation schemes. The major barriers were poor infrastructure and soil fertility, and poor access to farm inputs, farm implements, functioning markets and agricultural knowledge, which resulted in low yields, food insecurity and negative farm income. Most irrigated land remains unused, and marketing of produce is uncoordinated. Mobile technologies provide opportunities for market information dissemination. Institutions are needed to continuously encourage dialogue among agricultural value chain stakeholders to allow irrigators to align their operations to market demands and improve the viability of irrigation systems.

TI  - Working Poor? A Study of Rural Workers' Economic Welfare in Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study employs a mixed methods approach to investigate the poverty reduction potential of large-scale farm employment in Kenya. A long-run time series of real agricultural wages is created. The quantitative data are supplemented by life-story interviews of agricultural workers. The analysis suggests that large-scale farm employment can serve as a route out of deep poverty. However, to prevent wages from falling below the subsistence level, there is a need for a balanced rural development strategy whereby investments in smallholder agriculture and skills upgrades accompany the expansion of commercial agriculture.

TI  - Decent work in global food value chains: Evidence from Senegal
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The rapid growth and transformation of global food value chains has stimulated the development of rural labour markets and has important consequences for rural poverty reduction. While this transformation can be associated with substantial rural employment creation, there is still debate on the inclusiveness and quality of these jobs. We provide quantitative evidence on the inclusiveness of wage employment in the horticultural sector in Senegal and on the quality of this employment and disparities among vulnerable groups of workers. Using survey data from 525 workers, 392 hired workers in agro-industrial companies and 133 workers on small-scale farms, we assess the inclusiveness of employment towards female, young and migrant workers, and compare the quality of employment between these different groups of workers. The quality of employment is assessed through wages and a decent work index that captures multiple wage and non-wage dimensions of job quality. We use bivariate and multivariate analyses to examine the quality of employment and a decomposition analysis to explain wage gaps. Results suggest that job quality is better in the agro-industry than on small-scale farms. We find that the agroindustry is inclusive towards migrant, female and young workers, but that disparities in job quality exist within and across companies. Results illustrate substantial gender wage gaps across companies, but not within companies, and a lower likelihood of having decent employment among migrant and young workers. Our results suggest that wage gaps can be explained by differences in job characteristics, and are not directly based on workers' gender, age or migrant background. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Intervening in Cash Crop Value Chains for Improved Nutrition: Evidence from Rural Sierra Leone
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - Despite their economic importance, some export-oriented cash crops inherently have low nutritional value for smallholder farmers in developing countries, where the prevalence of malnutrition and food insecurity remains alarming. This paper investigates the nutritional effects of a multi-faceted nutrition-sensitive agricultural programme, uniquely designed to address food and nutrition insecurity among smallholder cocoa, coffee and cashew farmers in Sierra Leone. Estimation of programme effects is done using the inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment, which addresses potential selection bias on observables and accommodates multiple programme exposure. We do not find a positive effect on household and individual dietary outcomes of the production-focused component, unless it is complemented with nutrition education. The analysis shows that combining both cash crop production and nutrition interventions significantly improves household, maternal and children's dietary diversity and, more importantly, the intake of micronutrient-rich foods among smallholder cash cropping households. This result holds after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity using the correlated random effects model. We found improvements in nutrition knowledge, and women's confidence to be the potential pathways linking the combined intervention to better dietary outcomes.

TI  - Adoption Constraints for Small-scale Agroforestry-based Biofuel Systems in India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Small-scale agroforestry-based biofuel production has recently been proposed as a strategy for rural poverty alleviation, but few empirical evidence is available on farmer adoption of such novel systems. This study describes adoption of oilseed tree mixtures on smallholdings in Hassan district, South India, and examines the impact of a biofuel extension program and farmer characteristics on adoption. Cross-sectional survey data and regression analyses addressing various forms of selection bias, are used. The findings reveal that tree cultivation is much more prevalent than oilseed collection, and that various activities of the biofuel extension program only stimulate the former. Low seed prices and high opportunity costs of labour are major factors impeding households to collect seeds from planted or wild oilseed species. The paper concludes that the program succeeds as an agroforestry program but not as a biofuel program. Similar challenges pertain to small-scale agroforestry systems as to jatropha-based plantation systems, although the former are a Low-Risk High-Diversity approach to build feedstock for the future.

TI  - Better Management Practices for sustainable small-scale shrimp farming
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Better management practices (BMPs) for shrimp farming are a standardized set of farming practices to ensure the environmental and financial sustainability of shrimp farming systems. Uniform implementation of the BMPs poses a challenge if most of the shrimp farms in a given region are small (<2 ha). The adoption of BMPs and the associated economics were studied in two districts of Andhra Pradesh, the state that leads India's shrimp production. The overall rate of adoption was approximately 73%. Using factor analysis, all the partly adopted BMPs were categorized into six thematic factors: optimized input supply, improved management practices, routine maintenance, social responsibility, group approach, and culture-system-related and other practices. The ordinary least square regression model explained the factors that influenced the decision to adopt a given practice. These factors included key socio-economic variables such as age, education, and membership of farmers associations. Partial budget analysis revealed that adopting all the recommended BMPs in full would decrease the net returns from each crop by 16.6%. Although adopting the BMPs is voluntary, the practices crucial to the success of a crop were adopted by all the farmers (almost as if it were mandatory to adopt them), whereas those that involved significant costs were left out. Although small farmers can be persuaded to adopt the BMPs through awareness programmes, upgrading their holdings to a size at which a standardized farming system is feasible needs substantial investment. The governments of shrimp-exporting nations should improve their regulatory structure to embrace an inclusive governance model involving all the key actors in the value chain to make the small scale shrimp farming sustainable.

TI  - Southern sustainability initiatives in agricultural value chains: a question of enhanced inclusiveness? The case of Trustea in India
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - Recent studies have shed light on the emergence of Southern sustainability initiatives in commodity-based value chains. These initiatives position themselves as countering the exclusionary nature of many global multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs), as critically analysed by previous studies. However, a common theoretical perspective on the inclusiveness of MSIs is still lacking. By drawing on the theory of regimes of engagement, we develop a theoretical framework which helps understanding the overt and subtle practices of including or excluding different stakeholders in MSIs. We apply this framework to 'Trustea', an Indian MSI for sustainable tea production, to further investigate the 'inclusiveness paradigm' of Southern sustainability initiatives. Our findings highlight the complexity of stakeholder engagement across the different phases of Trustea's development, from initiation and code development to formal launch and roll-out. We find that different types of engagement can exist in parallel. Justifiable engagement is expressed in the participating organisations' reference to a shared common goal of Trustea, whereas familiar engagement is linked to the rootedness of the individuals involved in the Indian tea industry. Strategic engagement, in turn, comes to the fore through the strong emphasis on developing an Indian code for sustainable tea production and promoting adoption among tea growers. The importance of reaching this objective has led to the replication of exclusionary patterns also noted for global MSIs, as small-scale producers and other weak actors have been largely excluded from decision-making processes, despite informal efforts aimed at substitution of representation.

TI  - Factors enabling the participation of women in income sharing among banana (musa spp.) producing households in South Imenti, Meru County, Kenya
T2  - GENDER TECHNOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The growing demand for banana coupled with the introduction of better planting material in the last decade has led to increased area under banana production and commercialization. Just like most subsistence crops, banana production has been female dominated and controlled. However, commercialization has led to a dynamic shift in production with more men taking up active roles in the value chain. This has led to the displacement of women from the high value chain with men taking up dominant roles. The main objective of this paper was to determine factors that favor the participation of women in sharing of banana income. Data collection was done in March 2017 from 160 households in South Imenti, Meru County, Kenya. A systematic sampling technique was used to draw the respondents. Qualitative data was acquired through the use of key informant interviews and focus group discussions. A fractional logit model was used to determine the effects of independent variables on the participation of women in income sharing. Findings from the regression analysis indicate that the presence of off-farm income within the household increases the probability of a woman taking part in household decision-making.

TI  - Brazil nut forest concessions in the Peruvian Amazon: success or failure?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - In Peru, concessions for harvesting Brazil nuts (fruits of the Amazon tree Bertholletia excelsa) were launched in the Madre de Dios Department in 2000. This study analyses the extent to which the Brazil nut concession system (which covers about 1 million ha of closed canopy forest) has met its objective of providing a governance model for sustainable and equitable use. Primary and secondary information sources were used to analyse governance outcomes based on 10 indicators, and the performance of Brazil nut concessions in two contrasting land-use types in Madre de Dios were compared (within and outside protected areas). It was found that corresponding institutional arrangements have led, more than a decade later, to different socioeconomic, ecological and legal outcomes. Particularly outside protected areas, where the vast majority of the concessions are located, a paradoxical situation was found of ineffective over-regulation on paper but minimal intervention from state agencies; ineffective state monitoring and sanctions; poor law enforcement with excessive punitive measures; power imbalances in the value chain and illegal timber harvesting; the lack of a multiple forest-use framework; and overlapping, conflictual customary and regulatory governance. This paper argues that at present, the long-term sustainability of the Brazil nut concession system seems compromised. If the Brazil nut concession system is to enter into a new decade, this may only be possible by formally recognizing the multiplicity of land uses, implementing and validating sound silvicultural approaches, minimizing land use and management trade-offs in alignment with local aspirations, and establishing effective negotiation platforms with different productive sectors and government agencies.

TI  - Modelling trust and contractual arrangements in a local economy
T2  - DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE
AB  - This article investigates trust among dairy value-chain actors to understand the innovative process in a local productive sector in Tunisia. It uses a sample of 45 smallholder farmers chosen randomly nearby existing collection centres in the region. A trust variable is constructed employing 11 ordinal variables based on principal component analysis, and institutional arrangements then modelled to examine the effect of trust on contracting decisions and cooperative membership. The results show that trust is defined by values such as "integrity", "competence", and "existence of credible information", which are preconditions to sustainable contracts. The article contributes to the growing literature which considers social capital, networking and trust as determinants of farmer's behaviour, as opposed to the classical model of rationality.

TI  - Smallholder Compliance with Private Standard Certification: The Case of GlobalGAP Adoption by Mango Producers in Peru
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Our paper is a contribution to the literature exploring the patterns and determinants of smallholders' adoption of food standards. This case study focuses on the adoption of GlobalGAP by small-scale fresh mango producers in Peru. Based on primary data surveys, we find that a few smallholders comply with the standards because of the support received from exporters. The latter offers contract farming, including technical advice and the annual certification costs. Therefore, the paper underlines the key role of exporters in Peru as intermediaries and organizers in the way smallholders may participate in private standards in agrifood value chains.

TI  - Pre- and Post-Harvest Practices and Varietal Preferences of Tomato in Ghana
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Tailored interventions in the tomato sector require current information on production and marketing systems along with the constraints faced by the stakeholders. We conducted this study to understand the current production practices, stakeholders' varietal preferences, tomato market trends, and challenges along the crop's value chains. A multistage sampling method coupled with a random walk was used to identify survey locations and identify 180 respondents across seven regions in Ghana. The study showed that tomato was predominantly produced by male (81%) and literate farmers (84%). Tomato farmers were smallholder farmers generally cultivating less than five acres. Tomato was mainly cultivated under rainfed conditions. Farmers used both bought seeds and their own saved seeds for production. Farmers in Bono, Greater Accra, and the Upper East region largely cultivated improved tomato varieties, while farmers in the Bono East region cultivated local varieties. Across the regions, being a male and having access to irrigation facilities increased the probability of using improved varieties by 19% and 51%, respectively. The most important farmer and market preference criteria included high yield, medium to large fruit size and rounded fruit shape, red color, time to maturity and disease resistance. The major production challenges of tomato production included diseases, pests, and poor access to water for irrigation. The average yield of tomato varied from 6902.26 kg/ha in the Bono Region to 16,213.98 kg/ha in Bono East. Tomato was exclusively produced for fresh market. The major marketing challenges were low producer prices, low demand for produce, and competition from other farmers. This study provides key information to improve tomato value chains and guide the introduction or breeding of improved tomato varieties.

TI  - Agroecology accounting: biodiversity and sustainable livelihoods from the margins
T2  - ACCOUNTING AUDITING & ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a socio-ecological counter account of the role that agroecology plays in supporting the sustainable livelihoods of a co-operative of smallholder coffee farmers, where very little value is created at their end of the coffee commodity chain. Agroecology may be defined as the science that provides the ecological principles and concepts for the design and management of productive agricultural ecosystems that conserve natural resources.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a case study design of a coffee-producing co-operative in India using data collected from participant observation, focus groups and unstructured interviews with indigenous smallholder farmers. It combines the science of agroecology with the labour theory of value as a theoretical framework.
   Findings - An agroecological approach supports agricultural biodiversity, while promoting sustainable livelihoods since members of the co-operative are able to reduce their use of external inputs. However, an agroecological transformation is curtailed by the continued dependence on corporate value chains. A framework using the labour theory of value is used to explain the extraction of surplus value from the labour of both the smallholder farmers as well as nature. This study provides evidence of the role of government policy and practice in perpetuating the status quo by not promoting either research on agroecology or direct consumer to producer value chains while providing subsidies for the inputs of industrial agriculture.
   Originality/value - There have been very few studies that have provided an account of the limited value generated in agricultural commodity chains for smallholder farmers due to the need to purchase the inputs of industrial agriculture supported by government subsidies. This study extends the field of accounting for biodiversity into agriculture using the science of agroecology to explain the role played by biodiversity in increasing the amount of value generated by smallholder farmers. By utilising the labour theory of value, the authors have introduced the notion of the labour power of nature as represented by the environmental services that nature provides.

TI  - Food security, energy equity, and the global commons: a computable village model applied to sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - The depletion and fragmentation of forest eco-systems represent the serious challenges for countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The living conditions close to forests reflect a typical livelihood situation in Eastern African countries, where the rural population is heavily dependent on forests and their contribution to households' income, energy and hence food security, such is the case in Tanzania and Kenya for example. It is expected that current trends of deforestation will intensify, caused mainly by above-average population growth and the resultant food pressures combined with a rapid increase in energy demands. A computable village model has been developed to analyse the impact of alternative resource management strategies on the local income distribution and the long term resource use. The analysis uses the example of the Kakamega forest in Kenya and serves as an illustration of how forest resources significantly contribute to income generation in sub-Saharan African countries. Model results validate the assumed importance of forest income for the rural poor. Results further indicate that the sustainable utilization of forest resources will not be feasible unless alternative energy systems are broadly integrated into the village economy.

TI  - Technical and Socio-Economic Relevance in Technical Adoption: Case Study on Rotary Tillage Equipment in South West of Nigeria
T2  - AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA
AB  - The present and future shortage of farm labour for agriculture requires consideration in developing countries including Nigeria. As much as 80 % of farm power is provided for by human labour, which now call for need to develop and possibly engage simple and avoidable equipment to replace some manual tools for farming operations. Adoption of power tillers for tilling has brought some significant changes on overall production and sustainability of small farm systems. Addressing this requires acquisition of appropriate mechanized farm tillage tools. This began with the technical and social- economic assessment and recommendation for adoption which took place at Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, South West of Nigeria based on performance efficiency, affordability, durability, acceptability and ease of operation for the smallholders. A 6 hp (4.48 kw) Husqvarna T560 RS rotary cultivator of 0.78 m width was acquired for field performance test for appraisal and adoption for small scale farming as part of the front-end concern in the procurement-adoption chain. The effective field capacity of the machine on a land that was already under cultivation was found to be 0.033 ha/hr (i.e. 5 working days/hectare) and about 12 hours to till one acre in well cleared stone-free soil type where it was tested. The soil tillage of this equipment was found suitable for crops that can tolerate zero to shallow tillage depth of 0.21 m which this equipment was able to provide in the sandy loam under friable soil moisture condition. The awareness of the machine was 39 % among the farmers, 67 % rated the machine useful for tillage but the machine price range was above what their individual income can sustain in the study area. The machine was hereby recommended only for introduction to research institutions, private horticulturalists and vegetable cooperative farmers in the rural and urban farming communities with one to two hectare farm holding capacity.

TI  - Sugarcane Commercialization and Gender Experiences in the Zambian "Sweetest Town"
T2  - FEMINIST ECONOMICS
AB  - This article explores how sugarcane commercialization impacts gender relations, and processes that shape them, using two differently structured outgrower schemes - a settlement scheme and an European Union-driven block farm in southern Zambia. Results show gendered impacts across the schemes are complex and are shaped by diverse cultural arrangements as micro-processes. Intrahousehold patterns of decision making, land, and labor dynamics reveal that changing the structure, organization, and integration of outgrower schemes does not necessarily make them responsive to strategic gender needs. Further, these processes are insufficient in altering pre-existing sociocultural imbalances. Consequently, even where schemes are intentional about being inclusive, they are likely to replicate structural inequalities and fail to engender transformational changes among participants. This article raises the need to address the politics of land and labor relations, and their implications for different social groups within their cultural-historical context.

TI  - Leveraging the Potential of Sorghum as a Healthy Food and Resilient Crop in the South African Food System
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - An erosion of indigenous and traditional foods in the Global South has dramatically changed the global food system in the last 50 years. Reinvigorating these crops and the agro-biodiversity that they represent could provide benefits for healthier and more sustainable food systems. In South Africa, it has been proposed that studying indigenous plants more extensively and focussing on innovation to include them as mainstream foods on people's plates could improve food and nutrition security. With this background, this paper aims to contribute to addressing this challenge by researching sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) to identify the opportunities for innovating around sorghum as a healthy food and resilient crop. The paper traces sorghum through various encounters across the South African food system. The results point at clear areas where policy interventions could bolster the sorghum value chain. These include zero-rating VAT on sorghum products, investing more extensively in research and marketing across diverse stakeholders, raising awareness about the health benefits of sorghum and using public procurement as a way of instigating a market for novel sorghum products. The outcomes of a successful sorghum innovation programme could improve smallholder farmers' livelihoods, make a healthy food more accessible to South Africans and develop a local market for innovative products that utilize a crop that is resilient to projected climatic changes.

TI  - The added value of a water footprint approach: Micro- and macroeconomic analysis of cotton production, processing and export in water bound Uzbekistan
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB  - Since independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991, Uzbekistan is challenged to consolidate its efforts and identify and introduce suitable agricultural policies to ease the threat of advancing land, water and ecosystem deterioration. On the one hand, irrigated cotton production provides income, food and energy sources for a large part of the rural households, which accounts for about 70% of the total population. On the other hand, this sector is considered a major driver of the on-going environmental degradation. Due to this dual nature, an integrated approach is needed that allows the analyses of the cotton sector at different stages and, consequently, deriving comprehensive options for action. The findings of the economic based value chain analysis and ecologically-oriented water footprint analysis on regional level were complemented with the findings of an input-output model on national level. This combination gave an added value for better-informed decision-making to reach land, water and ecosystem sustainability, compared to the individual results of each approach. The synergy of approaches pointed at various options for actions, such as to (i) promote the shift of water use from the high water consuming agricultural sector to a less water consuming cotton processing sector, (ii) increase overall water use efficiency by expanding the highly water productive industrial sectors and concurrently decreasing sectors with inefficient water use, and (iii) reduce agricultural water use by improving irrigation and conveyance efficiencies. The findings showed that increasing water use efficiency, manufacturing products with higher value added and raising water users' awareness of the real value of water are essential for providing water security in Uzbekistan.

TI  - The potential for income improvement and biodiversity conservation via specialty coffee in Ethiopia
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - The specialty coffee sector represents opportunities for coffee farmers and other actors due to increased value within the supply chain, driven by elevated consumer purchase prices. We investigated these relationships up to the export stage, as well as the potential for specialty coffee to improve stakeholder participation in biodiversity conservation. Household data was collected from a sample of 272 coffee farmers belonging to five primary cooperatives, in the heavily forested area of Yayu, in the Illubabor administrative zone of Oromia regional state in south-western Ethiopia, for the 2017/2018 harvest season. Qualitative and quantitative data, gathered between 2015 and 2019, from focus group discussions, was used to supplement the survey and to explain the empirical findings. We show that the income from coffee (and thus household income) can be increased, in some cases substantially, via participation in the specialty coffee market. The unit price for coffee was much higher than standard market prices and those including certification premiums. Whilst quality is a key factor for specialty coffee, income increases via the specialty market are caveat bound. In particular, there is a critical requirement for efficient and effective cooperative management, and we provide suggestions for improvements. In the long-term, more focus is needed to increase the financial and human capacities of Ethiopian coffee cooperatives, to make them more effective partners in the specialty coffee value chain. The high conversion rates from harvested to clean exportable specialty coffee (8:1, or higher) is identified as a major constraint on profitability. We show that specialty coffee can bring about positive environmental benefits. Elevating coffee prices and farm profitability to bring household income levels to around or above the global poverty line may ensure the continuation of forest coffee production, and thus the retention of forest. The increases in income via specialty coffee production, reported in the study, were achieved without increasing land use or the application of environmentally costly inputs. Moreover, analysis of satellite data shows that a large proportion of the coffee farms surveyed retain a level of forest cover and quality approaching primary (undisturbed) forest, and that the coffee production area at Yayu has not experienced any significant deforestation (since 2000). We recommend that coffee premiums linked to environmental benefit should demonstrate clearly defined and appropriate metrics, as we have demonstrated here for forest (canopy) quality and coverage (area).

TI  - The Ambivalent Impact of Coffee Certification on Farmers' Welfare: A Matched Panel Approach for Cooperatives in Central Kenya
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Certification is promoted to improve rural welfare through better market access and improved agricultural practices. We compare net effects of Fairtrade- and Utz-Certified coffee production in Central Kenya, using a matched panel from 218 farm-households that belong to three cooperatives and were visited twice in 2009 and 2013. We distinguish between effects at field, farm, household, cooperative, community, and market levels. Both certification regimes improved coffee returns, but Fairtrade was more effective in coffee processing, whereas Utz contributed to productivity. Under stagnating coffee prices, Fairtrade farmers increased their coffee specialization, while Utz farmers reduced coffee areas but increased yield. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The effects of food price changes on smallholder production and consumption decision-making: evidence from Bangladesh
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH
AB  - There is still no consensus in academic debate about the impacts of food price changes on smallholder farmers' food and nutrition security. This paper aims to show how food price changes affect food and nutrition security of smallholder households in the Rajshahi district in north-western Bangladesh. To better understand smallholders' adaptive capacity with respect to uncertainties regarding food price changes, it is crucial to look more closely at the decision-making processes of smallholder households in their dual role as producers and consumers of food (prosumers). Smallholder farmers report in focus group discussions that they diversify their cropping practices to be more resilient against food price uncertainties. However, this strategy can be only successful if they are able to invest in inputs. Farmers face several constraints when seeking to make use of opportunities to sell diverse crops given their dependence on different types of local and regional buyers of food commodities. Furthermore, it becomes obvious that an increase in food prices does not automatically relate to an increase in farm-gate prices.

TI  - Resisting the coastal squeeze through village associations? Comparing environmental, organizational, and political challenges in Philippine seaweed-growing communities
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE
AB  - This article investigates collective action dynamics and local politics amidst Philippine seaweed-growing communities. Government agencies and civil society organizations generally encourage collaboration at village level through the formation of cooperatives and associations, often on the assumption that it facilitates the translation of economic growth into rural poverty reduction. Here, we explain how the formation of associations is entangled with the local and central state politics. We argue that civil society initiatives cannot be analysed separately from local and community-level politics. This contribution reveals a gap between the objectives of rural, coastal associations, and the organizational capacities of communities to sustain such initiatives. Utilizing community support as a means to compensate for market and government failures does not only depend on a facilitative policy environment and start-up support but also on household-level capabilities. It also demonstrates that in addition to the interests of big business and national-level politics, village-level politics can obstruct effective and sustained implementation of value chain interventions.

TI  - Smallholder tree-farmers and forest certification in Southeast Asia: alternative approaches to deliver more benefits to growers
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY
AB  - The smallholder tree-farm resources of Southeast Asia are generating substantial benefits for growers and support many successful domestic wood processors. They could provide even greater benefits at all levels of the supply and value chains if they enjoyed a sympathetic policy framework; technical and specialised support and training to promote productivity gains; and greater knowledge of market trends and access requirements. This paper reviews current forest certification systems as applied to smallholder tree-farmers in Southeast Asia, with a focus on the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Thailand and Viet Nam, and questions whether perceived benefits match operational realities. A critical issue in any form of transactional relationship between two or more people or institutions is to answer to mutual satisfaction the question, 'Who benefits?' This is particularly important in transactions between relatively weak and vulnerable and relatively strong and powerful individuals and groups, such as the relationships between smallholder tree-farmers in Southeast Asia and purchasers of certified wood products. We explore factors that drive certification and how they intersect with salient characteristics of smallholder tree-farms restricting the adoption of certification. We argue that new approaches are required to deliver the benefits necessary to expand smallholder participation in wood production supply chains, such as national codes of practice for small-scale forestry and agreed standards that encourage mutual recognition between verification systems. Innovative approaches should be adopted to deliver a fair, equitable and inclusive model that is relevant, practical, feasible and cost-effective for smallholder tree-farmers. As currently practised, certification has many positive aspects for some types of forests and wood producers but rarely for smallholder tree-farmers. A new approach to smallholder forest certification is required to ensure that the answer to the question, 'Who benefits?' is, 'All participants in the supply and value chain, including smallholder tree-farmers'. To achieve this outcome, certification organisations and forest products businesses should remove existing barriers to smallholder participation and develop initiatives to more fairly link smallholder tree-farmers with others in the supply chain, based on enabling and mutually supportive partnerships.

TI  - Grounding traffic: The cocaine commodity chain and land grabbing in eastern Honduras
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - This paper uses a global commodity chain (GCC) framework to explore the nexus of illicit economic activities and rural change. We unpack the micro-level economic processes by which a de facto land grab in eastern Honduras' Moskitia region was catalyzed and accelerated by the region's ascendance as a global hub of cocaine transit (ca. 2008-2012). We show how 'narco-brokers' mobilized a long-standing economic infrastructure to harness land and labor in the service of moving drugs, and how these 'mid-stream' activities captured millions of dollars from the cocaine commodity chain. We detail the processes by which those dollars ultimately concentrated land among in situ and ex situ elites by profoundly distorting social relations around land governance, labor, food production, and-ultimately-land ownership. The result was widespread dispossession, land and resource privatization, increased food insecurity, community conflict, and increased social stratification. Lands transferred from resident smallholders to elites helped to (a) integrate the region horizontally into Honduras' rentier-based cattle economy, and (b) improve the vertical integration of the pan-hemispheric cocaine trade through the speculation and profit-laundering services that the region's enclosure provided. This case highlights how economic coercions work synergistically with the more well-studied role of overt physical violence in frontier land grabs. We urge greater attention to the role of illicit capital in agrarian transformation globally. The study also points to the potential for transit spaces to shed much light on the workings of (illicit) global commodity chains and illicit economic geographies more broadly.

TI  - The mixing of methods: A three-step process for improving rigour in impact evaluations
T2  - EVALUATION
AB  - This article describes a systematic process that is helpful in improving impact evaluation assignments, within restricted budgets and timelines. It involves three steps: a rethink of the key questions of the evaluation to develop more relevant, specific questions; a way of designing a mix of research methods to generate evidence that supports more valid conclusions; and a step that aims to make evaluation outputs more useful. The approach is illustrated through two examples: one on measuring income impacts in an irrigated horticulture programme in Nepal, Zambia and Ethiopia; and another on the assessment of changes in organizational capacities for collective marketing by smallholders in Bolivia. The article demonstrates that this simple, straightforward and structured three-step process helped to reduce the tendency to one-method designs. Enhanced critical reflection within the team allowed for greater sensitivity to validity threats and the creativity to find ways to handle them.

TI  - Bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis prevalence in cattle from selected milk cooperatives in Arsi zone, Oromia region, Ethiopia
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) and bovine brucellosis are two important milk-borne zoonoses that have been shown to be prevalent to various degrees in Ethiopian cattle.
   The study was carried out in four Woredas (districts) around Asella town, Arsi Zone between October 2011 and March 2012 and included 318 small-holders in 13 dairy cooperatives that marketed the delivered milk. The aims of the study were i) to assess the prevalence of the two diseases in cattle in a cross-sectional study, ii) to assess potential risk factors of BTB and brucellosis to humans as well as the knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) among these farmers towards these diseases.
   Results: BTB testing using the comparative intradermal skin test (CIDT) was done on 584 milking cows, out of which 417 were serologically tested for brucellosis using the Rose Bengal Plate Test and reactors confirmed with an indirect ELISA test (PrioCHECK (R)). The individual animal prevalence was 0.3% (95% CI 0.1% to 1.3%) for BTB, 1.7% (95% CI 0.8% to 3.5%) for brucellosis and 8.9% (95% CI 6.8% to 11.5%) for MAC (Mycobacterium avium complex). Of the 13 milk cooperatives, two had at least one positive BTB reactor and five had animals positive for brucellosis.
   Cross-breeds accounted for 100% and 71.4% of the BTB and brucellosis reactors respectively. For both diseases, there were prevalence variations depending on Woreda. No animal was concomitant reactor for BTB and brucellosis. Raw milk was consumed by 55.4% of the respondents. 79.2% of the respondents reported touching the afterbirth with bare hands. The latter was fed to dogs in 83% of the households. One cow among the herds of the 130 interviewees had aborted in the last 12 months. Among the interviewees, 77% stated knowing tuberculosis in general but 42 out of the 130 respondents (32.3%) did not know that BTB was transmitted by livestock. Less than half (47.7%) of the respondents knew about brucellosis.
   Conclusions: Low prevalence of both diseases reflected the potential for the area to compete with the growing milk demand. The authors discussed the possible control strategies for the area.

TI  - Enhancing knowledge exchange and performance recording through use of short messaging service in smallholder dairy farming systems in Malawi
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - Monitoring animal performance is a challenge due to lack of systematic recording in the smallholder dairy sector in Malawi. A mobile recording system using short messaging service (SMS) was therefore trialled for data capturing and subsequent feedback provision to farmers following analyses and interpretation. This study aimed at drawing lessons regarding use of SMS recording system among dairy farmers. Of the 210 participants, 85% were farmers and 25% were other dairy value chain players. Farmers were from eight intervened (monitored for 18 months) and eight control Milk Bulking Groups (MBG). There are three regions in Malawi and Central region had the highest participants [59% (124)] than Northern [23% (49)] and Southern [1% (2)] regions submitting data using SMS. Milk production was the most recorded data and analyses showed that mean yield in litres per cow (10.7 +/- 0.14) was similar to average estimate in literature for Malawi (10.4 +/- 1.57). Household daily milk consumption (1.2 +/- 0.04), milk sold through formal market (610.0 +/- 55) and amount of milk rejected per day per MBG (5.9 +/- 0.86) in litres were captured. Farmers asked questions and received timely feedback via SMS. Therefore, it is possible to capture quality data using SMS technology that is adequate for conducting analyses to inform decision-making.

TI  - Energy access and pandemic-resilient livelihoods: The role of solar energy safety nets
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Lack of energy access undermines the socio-economic conditions of households, reducing their resilience, particularly in the face of disruptive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hundreds of millions of poor rural households, who live in remote and difficult-to-reach areas, are still without access to energy. Solar energy safety nets, in the form of targeted social assistance programs and off-grid technological solutions, do not only advance energy access but also develop capacities of households to prepare for, respond to, and recover from specific threats like pandemics. We discuss ongoing solar energy safety net programs in the largest off-grid solar markets of Bangladesh, India, Kenya, and Nigeria, and how such programs are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that solar energy safety net programs should be maintained and updated to emphasize their potential for building pandemic-resilient livelihoods. These programs can be supported with efforts to build local value chains and economies based on clean electricity. Well-designed solar energy safety net policies generate multiple co-benefits, including the resilience of households to pandemics.

TI  - Scaling agricultural mechanization services in smallholder farming systems: Case studies from sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - There is great untapped potential for farm mechanization to support rural development initiatives in low- and middle-income countries. As technology transfer of large machinery from high-income countries was ineffective during the 1980s and 90s, mechanization options were developed appropriate to resource poor farmers cultivating small and scattered plots. More recently, projects that aim to increase the adoption of farm machinery have tended to target service providers rather than individual farmers. This paper uses the Scaling Scan tool to assess three project case studies designed to scale different Mechanization Service Provider Models (MSPMs) in Mexico, Zimbabwe, and Bangladesh. It provides a useful framework to assess the gap between international lessons learned on scaling captured in forty tactical questions over ten "scaling ingredients" as perceived by stakeholders involved in the projects, as well as private sector actors and government employees. Although at first sight the case studies seem to successfully reach high numbers of end users, the assessment exposes issues around the sustainable and transformative nature of the interventions. These are highly influenced by the design of the projects and by the environment and context of the intervention areas. Across the three case studies, large-scale adoption of the models was found to be hampered by lack of finance to set up MSPMs and insufficient collaboration among the value chain actors to strengthen and foster Mechanization Service Provider (MSP) entrepreneurs. Applying a scaling perspective on each case study project exposed important lessons on minimizing project dependencies. Positive examples include integration of capacity development materials in vocational training centers in Zimbabwe, promotion of MSPMs by other donors in East Africa and levering of nearly USD six million of private sector investment in appropriate machinery in Bangladesh. On the other hand, there is still a high dependency on the projects in terms of coaching of service providers, facilitating collaboration along the value chain, and provision of leadership and advocacy to address issues at governance level. These results have important implications for similar development interventions aimed at increasing smallholder access to mechanization services at scale and is to our knowledge the first cross-continental assessment of these issues to date.

TI  - Water innovation in South Africa: Mapping innovation successes and diffusion constraints
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - Because of its long experience with water scarcity, South Africa has built a highly active research and innovation capacity in the water sector, which is spearheaded by the Water Research Commission (WRC). As a result, South African scientists have been among the significant contributors to new knowledge creation in the water innovation domain, especially in water treatment technologies. This innovation dynamism has however not been translated into a large-scale harnessing of technological innovations to avert the looming threat of water shortage. This paper combines innovation diffusion theory with the technology maturation framework to explore the main factors that help explain the pace of innovation diffusion in the South African water sector. Data from key informant interview analysis as well as available secondary sources indicate that financing constraints and technical validation difficulties are among the main hurdles limiting the ability of innovators to scale up their inventions for commercialisation. Adoption costs and lack of municipal support budget are the most important factors that limit the ability of low income rural households to adopt water innovations. Policy measures to support diffusion strategies are necessary to ensure that innovators have the means to overcome the multiple diffusion obstacles that they are confronted with.

TI  - The socio-economic context for improving food security through land based aquaculture in Solomon Islands: A pen-urban case study
T2  - MARINE POLICY
AB  - Future fish demand-supply scenarios project that investment in aquaculture will be needed to ensure fish for food security in Solomon Islands. In 2010 a study of two pen-urban areas of Solomon Islands analysed the demand and potential for inland aquaculture, and the role of the introduced Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) in household livelihoods and existing value chains. Of 178 households interviewed, marine reef fish were the preferred fish for consumption, although tinned fish was also common. At the study sites, Mozambique tilapia was accessible and contributed to food security, particularly for inland households. Sixty five percent of the people actively fished for tilapia at least monthly; 13% of these fished on almost a daily basis. Fish were consumed by men, women and children and sold by both men and women in local village markets. Mozambique tilapia is considered to perform poorly in aquaculture. While other species like Nile tilapia or milkfish (Chanos chanos) are being considered for aquaculture by the Solomon Islands Government, Mozambique tilapia is currently the only cost-effective and widely available alternative for farming fish for household food security. This study lends weight to the premise that pen-urban households that are cash poor are likely to benefit nutritionally from easier access to tilapia or other freshwater fish. (C) 2013 The Authors.

TI  - Household nutrition and income impacts of using dairy technologies in mixed crop-livestock production systems
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - Technologies like improved breeds of dairy cows and improved forages have the potential to significantly increase dairy cow productivity and farmers' profits in developing countries. However, adoption of such technologies has been low in Ethiopia, despite numerous efforts to disseminate the technologies in the past. Some studies argue that adoption of technologies is low because welfare effects of the technologies could be insignificant or negative to certain groups of farmers. This article employed propensity score matching and inverse probability weighting estimator with regression adjustment to examine the difference in household nutrition and income between adopters and nonadopters of dairy technologies in rural Ethiopia. We find that adoption of cross-bred dairy cows and improved forages increases household nutrition and income. The significant household nutrition and income impact for adopters support the notion that many Ethiopian smallholders have not adopted dairy technologies because adopters and nonadopters of dairy technologies have inherent differences in welfare outcome potentials. The results suggest that interventions that enhance access to farm resources and address barriers to input and output value chains could improve adoption of dairy technologies.

TI  - Potential contributions of market-systems development initiatives for building climate resilience
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Market systems interventions are an increasingly common approach to agricultural development. While the impacts of these interventions on poverty reduction and market participation by smallholders has been studied, little is known about their contributions to building climate resilience. This paper analyzes the compatibility of market systems and climate resilience approaches to agricultural development, using the United States government's Feed the Future program as an empirical case study. Drawing on case studies in Ethiopia and Honduras, the paper examines the synergies and tensions between market systems and climate resilience approaches. The study finds that the market systems interventions have contributed to climate resilience, but also evidence of significant limitations due to fundamental tensions between market system and resilience approaches in terms of what their goals are, who they target, and how they approach their objectives. This study has important implications for the design and implementation of climate resilience programs and policies, as well as the expectations that agricultural development programs will be able to build climate resilience. Recognizing the inherent tensions that exist between market systems approaches and resilience approaches and explicitly discussing the trade-offs between the goals, target audiences, and primary mechanisms of each approach would represent an important step forward if market systems programs are going to contribute to climate resilience.

TI  - Small-scale poultry enterprises in Kenyan medium-sized cities
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the profitability of urban chicken production in the medium-sized cities of Kisumu and Thika, Kenya. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected in 2016 from a sample of 157 indigenous chicken producers in the two cities. Descriptive analyses were used to characterize indigenous chicken production, marketing and profitability. In addition, multivariate regression models were estimated to determine factors influencing profitability of the enterprise. Findings Urban indigenous chicken production mainly serves a dual role of food provision and income generation. The enterprise is profitable, generating an average gross margin of Ksh. 756/bird. The multivariate regression models show that access to high-value markets, household income level and the type of production system used significantly affect profitability of indigenous chicken farming. However, poultry diseases and high input costs especially feed are the major constraints to poultry farming.
   Originality/value Studies assessing profitability of urban agricultural enterprises are scant. Thus, this study provides insights on the profitability of a common urban agriculture enterprise.

TI  - Characterisation of production, marketing and consumption patterns of farmed tilapia in the Nile Delta of Egypt
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Egypt has one of the world's largest aquaculture sectors which makes a significant contribution to income, employment creation and food security. However, there are very limited data available on the farmed tilapia value chain. The aim of this study therefore was to characterise production, marketing and consumption patterns of farmed tilapia in the Nile Delta of Egypt. A cross sectional study was conducted to collect data from tilapia producers (100), transporters (32), retailers (100), fish fry shops (20) and households (300) in three case study communities (fish producing, pen-urban and rural community). We conducted structured questionnaire interviews and participatory assessments for producers and consumers. Focus group discussions with mothers were also held to collect data for the availability, sources and consumption patterns of tilapia.
   Results showed that, more than half of producers were small scale, having a farm size of 10 feddan or less (1 feddan = 4200 m(2)). The main water supply for almost all farms was agricultural drain water, a potential source of contamination with chemical and biological hazards. The main production constraints were reported to be feed prices, water quality and availability, land rent, fuel and energy sources and environmental conditions. The farmed tilapia value chain was short with some value added in the form of marketing fresh and live fish as well as selling tilapia in fried or grilled form. The majority of produced tilapia was transported to retail sale and sold to consumers as fresh, while only a small proportion was processed by cleaning, grilling or frying. A lack of hygiene during transportation and marketing of farmed tilapia was found that could be potential sources for post-harvesting contamination. The availability and frequency of tilapia consumption were higher in the community in the production areas than in other communities. In non-producing areas, tilapia may be available in the market once a week during the village market day. Potential areas for further research in order to improve safety, quality and production of farmed tilapia were identified. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Transdisciplinary Project Communication and Knowledge Sharing Experiences in Tanzania and Zambia through a One Health Lens
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The project "Strengthening food and nutrition security through family poultry and crop integration in Tanzania and Zambia" brings together animal, crop, and human health specialists, economists, ecologists, social scientists, and practitioners to work with participating communities. It aims to increase poultry value chain, crop farming systems efficiency, and household food and nutrition security and thus requires understanding of, and ability to work effectively within, complex systems. In this context, communication knowledge sharing and synthesis between stakeholders from diverse backgrounds and a range of experiences, perspectives, agendas, and knowledge is a challenge. To address this situation, communication is conceived as a dialog and a participatory process bringing together all stakeholders. This process results in unanticipated and unexpected results that require a high degree of flexibility and adaptability from team members. The paper analyses the approach and aim of the communication strategy developed for the project and the challenges faced.

TI  - Climate Change Adaptation by Smallholder Tea Farmers: a Case Study of Nepal
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - Climate change is threatening the livelihood of tea farmers in Nepal. Simultaneously, the production of tea is becoming an increasingly important economic sector for the country. This study aimed to reveal the adaptation behavior towards climate change among smallholder tea farmers, particularly which demographic, institutional, and information source factors are likely to influence the degree of adaptation. We collected quantitative data in the district of Ilam via 91 farmers through a questionnaire survey and applied descriptive statistics, multiple regression, and binary logistic regression models to analyze the collected data. Findings revealed that information sources (peer exchange, internet, and training attendance), as well as institutional factors (cooperative membership and credit access), positively influenced the degree of climate change adaptation among the respondents. Easier credit access and joining cooperatives could enhance the adaptative capacity of smallholder tea farmers. Improving the interaction between the Nepalese government and stakeholders involved in the domestic tea value chain could also increase economic success.

TI  - Demystifying agritourism development in Fiji: Inclusive growth for smallholders
T2  - TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY RESEARCH
AB  - Agritourism has gained traction with a variety of stakeholders within the Pacific to supplement farm revenue, create linkages to tourism and ultimately contribute to sustainable economic development. This paper, with a focus on smallholders, examines the key constraints of agriculture, current agritourism products, policy development initiatives, and proposes an open framework for agritourism in Fiji. Among the key considerations are a careful examination of tourist preferences, the promotion of agritourism on working farms without displacing the key activity of food production, and redefining agritourism as a value for money experience rather than a niche market in the Pacific region.

TI  - Participation in contract farming and farm performance: Insights from cashew farmers in Ghana
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - The global demand for cashew nuts continues to increase steadily. However, many African countries face difficulties in marketing and adding value to the product. Using recent survey data of 391 cashew farmers in Ghana, this paper contributes to the growing evidence on the significance of contract farming (CF) in improving the welfare of rural households in developing countries. Specifically, the paper analyzes the factors that influence cashew farmers' decisions to participate in CF, and the impact of participation on farmers' performance. We employ a recently developed switching regression model with endogenous explanatory variables and endogenous switching to control for selection bias caused by observable and unobservable factors. The empirical results show that participation in CF significantly increases labor productivity and price margins, as well as cashew yields, and net revenues. A disaggregated analysis of the sample into farm size categories reveals that small-sized cashew farms tend to benefit more through CF, compared to medium- and large-sized farms.

TI  - Rural transformation, cereals and youth in Africa: What role for international agricultural research?
T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - Young people are increasingly linked to targeted agriculture and food security interventions. In Africa, the argument is that the combination of agricultural value chains, technology and entrepreneurship will unlock a sweet spot for youth employment. This article examines this argument from a rural transformations perspective. A framework is proposed with which to analyse young people's economic room to manoeuvre in different rural contexts and the differential abilities of young people to exploit associated opportunities. Using cereal agri-food systems as an example, the article identifies two new research areas that address important knowledge gaps: how young rural people in Africa engage with these systems and what pathways they use to become engaged. To address these questions, we propose an analytical framework built around key contextual factors that constrain or enable young people's economic activity. By pursuing the proposed research agenda, international agricultural research could make important contributions to both agricultural policy debates and development-oriented interventions.

TI  - Contract farming: opportunity cost and trade-offs
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - An important literature has established that participation in contract farming leads to higher incomes and has a number of other beneficial effects on the welfare of participating households. Yet no one has looked at the opportunity cost of and the various trade-offs involved in participating in contract farming. I look at the relationship between participation in contract farming and income from (i) livestock, (ii) labor markets, (iii) nonfarm businesses, and (iv) agricultural sources other than livestock and contract farming and (v) unearned income. Using data from Madagascar, I find that participation in contract farming is associated with a 79% decrease in how much income per capita the average household derives from labor markets and a 47% decrease in how much income per capita it derives from nonfarm businesses, but also with a 51% increase in how much income per capita the average household derives from agricultural sources other than livestock and contract farming, possibly due to technological spillovers. Thus, even though contract farming has been shown to improve welfare in multiple ways in this context, it looks as though those gains come at the cost of an agricultural involution on the part of participating households, who seem to turn away from non-agricultural activities. This has important implications for structural transformation narratives.

TI  - Economic Reforms and the Rise of Milk Mega Farms in Vietnam: Governing the Post-socialist Transition
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Over the past 30 years, major economic reforms have deeply impacted the Vietnamese agro-food sector. In this study, we use the concept of "sociotechnical transition" to capture the multiple dimensions of this transformation. We focus in particular on the rapid emergence of the Vietnamese dairy industry. Up to the mid-2000s, the sector had been dominated by smallholder dairy farmers working in close collaboration with private milk processors and public services. This resulted in what we propose to call a "peasant" sociotechnical regime. In the late 2000s, the sector experienced a growing competition from agro-industries and mega farms holding several thousand cows. The role of smallholder producers has decreased and the sector has moved toward medium to large-scale producers. This new "corporate" regime profoundly modified the outcome of the post-socialist "transition". This case-study highlights important issues related to the governance of these rapid changes.

TI  - Assessing the sustainable development and intensification potential of beef cattle production in Sumbawa, Indonesia, using a system dynamics approach
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The intensification of beef cattle production in dryland areas of East Indonesia has the potential to substantially raise the incomes of smallholder farmers that dominate the sector. In this study we assess the potential for intensifying beef production on Sumbawa Island, by introducing a household feedlot production system (2-20 animals) based on the Leucaena leucocephala (leucanea) tree legume as an improved source of feed. We used a system dynamics approach to model the entire value chain, accounting for herd dynamics, demand dynamics and seasonality. Our findings complement the growing body of biophysical evidence about the potential success of this intervention, by simulating improvements in the annual profitability for beef farmers in the project area of up to 415% by 2023. Increases in farm profit were shown to depend near equally on the higher productivity of the leucaena feeding system and an associated price premium, demonstrating the importance of supporting improved agricultural production with better marketing practices. The intervention was also shown to generate positive or neutral benefits for the main post-farm value chain actors. Importantly, it also reduced the GHG emission intensity of outputs from the beef herd by 16% by 2020. We explored number of scale-out pathways, including a relatively moderate pace of autonomous adoption for our main analysis, resulting in the accumulation of 3,444 hectares of leucaena 20-years after the initial project phase, which could sustain the fattening of 37,124 male cattle per year. More ambitious rates of scale-out were found to be possible without exceeding the animal and land resources of the island.

TI  - "People, Planet & Profit": Consumer-Oriented Hegemony and Power Relations in Palm Oil and Agrofuel Certification
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Palm oil comprises the fastest growing monoculture in the world and is used for food, cosmetics, and agrofuels. This article analyzes the attempts to guarantee the sustainable production of palm oil and agrofuels through voluntary certification schemes such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) from a critical state and hegemony theory perspective. Rather than seeing the RSPO as a voluntary and nongovernmental instrument that represents the interests of all concerned stakeholders equally, I analyze the roundtable as part of a transnational network state that is characterized by strategic selectivities, that is, some interests and strategies are privileged over others. Based on expert interviews in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore and the analysis of primary documents I conclude that the RSPO privileges business interests in general and export-oriented palm oil companies and downstream industries along the value chain in particular, whereas smallholders, plantation workers, and indigenous peoples are marginalized through different structures and processes, contributing to an actual depoliticization of socioecological conflicts.

TI  - A social network analysis to determine success factors of food security innovations in Tanzania
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS
AB  - To improve resistance to upcoming vulnerabilities to climate change and cope with rising food demand smallholders in Sub-Saharan Africa need to upgrade their local food systems. Upgrading strategies (UPS) within existing food value chains have the potential to secure food at the local to regional level. In this paper, we determined the roles of actors and their interlinkages and motivations in UPS, and identified possible success factors of group performance within different UPS in Tanzania: a) tied ridges, b) optimised market-oriented grain storage, c) maize sheller and d) millet thresher. We used individual interviews, via the social network analysis tool Net-Map, as well as focus group discussions. The results show that actors' motivations for participating in a UPS group differed between groups and between actors. Important success factors derived from these findings were favorable village locations followed by sociability and personal contact among stakeholders and with researchers. These results provide the basis for future strategic planning that will enhance participation and a potential up-scaling.

TI  - Export-Oriented Horticultural Production in Laikipia, Kenya: Assessing the Implications for Rural Livelihoods
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Smallholders in the global South are confronted with new opportunities and risks emanating from globalized markets of agricultural goods. In Kenya, large-scale export-oriented horticulture farms, cultivating fruits, flowers and vegetables, were by and large established in the 1980s. In Laikipia County, the farms have grown to be the most important employers tying the region into global markets. The growth of the industry has direct as well as indirect impacts on local livelihoods. Based on qualitative data gathered from 55 interviews held with experts, local households and employees, the assessment shows a range of economic, social and environmental opportunities as well as constraints. Three major shortcomings are identified, the first being increasing river water abstractions and related water scarcity, second the call for living wages and social security, and third constraints smallholders face as out-growers. Addressing these issues can contribute to a more sustainable development in the region.

TI  - COVID-19 and food systems in Pacific Island Countries, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste: Opportunities for actions towards the sustainable development goals
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Context: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global food systems. This has led to different strategies by communities, governments, and businesses involved in food systems to mitigate and adapt to the unfolding pandemic. Small Island Developing States are particularly exposed to the conflation of risks from COVID-19 disease, economic downturns, underlying climate vulnerabilities and biosecurity risks.
   Objective: Our study aimed to identify the food systems vulnerabilities, impacts, and opportunities for supporting resilience and sustainable development in selected Pacific Island countries, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste. The study focused on the impacts from the first six months of the pandemic (February-July 2020), with remote data collection and analysis done between May and July 2020.
   Methods: We conducted 67 interviews, and triangulated information with desktop and news sources emerging at the time. We present results on the effect on smallholder livelihoods, supply chains, governance, communities and employment. Overall, the major impacts of COVID-19 have been on economies, posing risks to future food security and further hampering progress towards key Sustainable Development Goals.
   Results and conclusions: We found that unemployment and economic contraction have been the most severe effects to date, with long-term consequences for food value chains and smallholder farmers. Disruptions to tourism, labour migration, and remittances have led to varying socio-economic impacts throughout the region. Vulnerable groups, notably women, urban poor, and youth, have been disproportionately affected by unemployment. TimorLeste has had some social protection measures, whereas in Pacific Countries these have been varied. The lockdowns and State of Emergency initially influenced the distribution and marketing of food, but local food economies are starting to stabilise. The continued functioning of international food supply chains reduced the risk of food insecurity in high import dependent nations, notably import dependent countries like Tuvalu and Kiribati.
   Significance: The results have significance for three recovery pathways. The first recovery pathway relates to revisiting value chains in light of restricted travel. The second recovery pathway exists through leveraging the adaptive capacities of communities to stimulate innovative agriculture that also integrates climate adaptation and nutrition. The third recovery pathway relates to addressing the structural challenges that perpetuate inequalities and poverty while finding new ways of implementing inclusive policies and research. Our study

TI  - A new sustainability model for measuring changes in power and access in global commodity chains: through a smallholder lens
T2  - PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - High-value agricultural commodities face substantial economic, environmental and social sustainability challenges. As a result, commodity industries are adopting sustainable supply-and value-chain models to make production more efficient, traceable and risk-averse. These top-down models often focus on giving higher prices to smallholder producers. While an important component of sustainability, this focus on farm-gate prices has shown mixed results in part because they are less effective in highlighting the asymmetrical power relationships and the socio-economic and ecological complexity in high-value commodity production. Here, we use a novel method to measure and visualise changes in smallholder power in Madagascar's northeast 'vanilla triangle'-home to about 80% of the world's high quality vanilla. Our results reveal the paradox that during the recent price surge an overall increase in smallholders' multi-dimensional power to access economic benefits was accompanied by a decrease in many other equally important measures of sustainability. This illustrates how effective models for understanding global sustainable commodity chains should incorporate smallholders' perspectives that often emphasise complexity and uncertainty, and which aims to increase power and access for producers across both high and low price points.

TI  - Digital Extension Interactive Voice Response (IVR) mLearning: Lessons Learnt From Uganda Pig Value Chain
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - We assessed the effectiveness of Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology in delivering biosecurity messages for the control of African swine fever (ASF) in Uganda using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 408 smallholder pig farmers. Our results show that IVR technology significantly improved knowledge of farmers who had not been exposed to training on biosecurity. Furthermore, it enhanced knowledge for farmers who had received face-to-face (f2f) training in biosecurity. This group of farmers recorded the highest knowledge gain following IVR training compared to farmers who did not receive f2f training. IVR technology was perceived by farmers as a new technology capable of transforming their lives because it is time efficient, has high potential for resource saving and flexibility. IVR also seems to be gender sensitive as it addresses some of the constraints women face in accessing conventional extension services such as time. IVR is an innovative way for delivery of advisory information to pig farmers. The scalability of IVR technology could further be explored and its feasibility assessed for wider use by the extension systems in Uganda and elsewhere.

TI  - Discovering Neverland: Sao Tome and Principe and the development of the agricultural heritage of a multi-ethnic population
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The history of Sao Tome and Principe (STP) shows that the development of the rocas, agriculturally based structures of colonial time, form a heritage linked to STP's human development. Different agricultural products have characterized the historical periods of migration, slavery, creolism, and gender emancipation up to the present day; agricultural products and ethnic contamination make STP unique with the culture-nature relationship providing a useful tool for a better understanding of its historical roots. The essay argues that STP's sustainable development could be fostered through a valorisation of historical agricultural heritage. Agri-food geographical indications (GIs), which directly link territories, peoples, and traditions could also serve this purpose. GIs could lead to improvements in the export price of STP's cocoa, coffee, pepper and, at the same time, increasing the cultivation of a number of other crops, especially indigenous fruits which are usually planted in combination. These systems have proven to attract better prices to products, increase labour specialised market; they also could foster a multi-faceted approach to territorial development, including eco-tourism. However challenges are left as the country is still lacking proper infrastructures, skilled labours, management and institutional support. The question will be whether STP fragile agri-food setting would be able to support these new mechanisms that require strong value chains, respect of territorial biodiversity and the role played by AgriSMEs-small farmers.

TI  - Structural equation model of young farmers' intention to adopt sustainable agriculture: a case study in Bangladesh
T2  - RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - This paper aims to assess young farmers' willingness to adopt sustainable agriculture (SA) by implementing the expanded theory of planned behavior (TPB) within the northern region of Bangladesh. The outcomes attained specified that attitudes toward SA, perceived behavior control and perceived self-identity have progressive and fundamental impacts on adoption behavior and affect farmers' intentions to adopt SA's particular production mechanism. On the other hand, the social interface view toward SA is not significantly associated with the Bangladeshi farmer's adoption intention. The results also show that interconnections between social and familial pressure are not significant for sustainable farming practice adoption intentions. However, the interconnections among the psychosocial factors have a crucial role in formulating the TPB to forecast the intentional behavior for adopting SA practices. Thus, the government should highlight the advantages of several sustainable agricultural practices and circulate more detailed information regarding SA tactics to improve the knowledge gap of smallholder farmers. Furthermore, training facilities should be extended to improve the attitude and perceived self-identity of young farmers. Moreover, the formulation of structural information sharing platforms and agricultural value chain facilities should also help shape young farmers' interpersonal behavior in adopting SA practices.

TI  - Farmer-herder conflicts and food insecurity: Evidence from rural Nigeria
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS REVIEW
AB  - Food security in many developing countries has been threatened by several factors such as unequal land distribution, ineffective land reform policies, inefficient agricultural value chains, and an increasing number of climate disasters. In Nigeria, these threats are exacerbated by rapid population growth and extreme weather events, which have resulted in farmer-herder conflicts in most agrarian communities. This paper examines the differential impacts of the incidence and severity of farmer-herder resource use conflicts on food insecurity of rural households in Nigeria. We employ a two-stage predictor substitution model to estimate survey data collected from 401 rural households in Nigeria. The empirical results show that both the incidence and the severity of farmer-herder conflicts significantly increase food insecurity, and the severity of these conflicts has a larger impact than their incidence. The estimates of the conditional mixed process models confirm the robustness of our results. Additional analysis reveals that the incidence and severity of farmer-herder conflicts positively and significantly affect food insecurity, measured by the number of days with limited varieties of food eaten. Our findings highlight the importance of policy interventions that address ongoing farmer-herder conflicts in affected countries like Nigeria to enhance food security from a sustainable development perspective.

TI  - Sustainable palm oil as a public responsibility? On the governance capacity of Indonesian Standard for Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO)
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - This paper is motivated by the observation that Southern governments start to take responsibility for a more sustainable production of agricultural commodities as a response to earlier private initiatives by businesses and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Indonesia is one of the leading countries in this respect, with new public sustainability regulations on coffee, cocoa and palm oil. Based on the concept of governance capacity, the paper develops an evaluation tool to answer the question whether the new public regulation on sustainable palm oil (ISPO) may become a viable alternative to private regulation. ISPO embraces a tremendous governance challenge as thousands of companies and millions of smallholder farmers are expected to participate. It is concluded that, although ISPO has initiated a process of change, it has not yet developed its full potential. The main reason regards ISPO's rather loose problem definition, weak authority of the implementing organization, and the fact that the reliability of ISPO is still too low to convince (parts) of the global market. ISPO may therefore face difficulties in meeting its own targets and solving palm-oil related problems, such as deforestation, biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions, and social conflicts between big plantations and local communities. The main governance challenge regards combining a more authoritative implementation mechanism with a convincing balance between sustainability objectives and economic interests of the sector.

TI  - Limitations of Inclusive Agribusiness in Contributing to Food and Nutrition Security in a Smallholder Community. A Case of Mango Initiative in Makueni County, Kenya
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Food and nutrition security remain at the top of development priorities in low income countries. This is especially the case for smallholder farmers who derive their livelihood from agriculture yet are often the most deprived. Inclusive agribusinesses have been championed as a key strategy to address local constraints that limit smallholders' participation in regional and global value chains, thereby enhancing their livelihood, and food and nutrition security, accordingly. In this paper, based on a mixed method research approach, we explore the potential food and security contribution of inclusive agribusiness in Makueni county, Kenya. We focus on the smallholders' constraints and needs, exploring the extent to which these are addressed by such purported pro-poor approach. First, using independent samplet-tests and a probit regression model, we explore who are able to participate in an ongoing intervention. We compare how participants and non-participants differ in terms of key socio-economic characteristics and establish which of these attributes are associated with successful integration into the business. Second, we again use independent samplet-tests to determine how the participants and non-participants compare in terms of their food and nutrition security. The household food and nutrition security is assessed with the conventional measurement tools: the household food insecurity access scale and the household food dietary diversity score. We find that participation in the inclusive agribusiness favors smallholder households with relatively higher production capacity in terms of better physical capital (land and number of mango trees, financial capital), access to loans, and human capital (age, education, and family size). Following income improvement, the participants' household food security situation is significantly better than for non-participants. However, participation does not improve household dietary diversity, implying that improvement in income does not necessarily lead to better household nutrition security. To address the limitations of inclusive agribusiness, we propose policymakers and development actors to critically explore the contextual background prior to intervention design and implementation, and accordingly devise a broader approach for more inclusivity of the very poor and marginalized, and better food and nutrition security outcomes as a result. Given that not every smallholder could benefit from inclusive agribusiness for their food needs due to resource scarcity, alternative livelihood supports, including social protection programs and safety net plans, should be considered.

TI  - Building Sustainable Smallholder Cooperatives in Emerging Market Economies: Findings from a Five-Year Project in Kenya
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - A comparative study of two smallholder dairy cooperatives in Kenya examines the question: what factors are conducive to producing sustainable smallholder cooperatives that can gain entry into the vertical value chain in liberalized post-colonial economies? The relative weight of income advantage; selective individual incentives and, social capital on maintaining member patronage are assessed within variable environmental constraints and opportunities facing different cooperatives. The methodology includes case study observation of the cooperatives during a five-year period, as well as sample surveys of members and non-members that include indicators of dairy income; reasons why farmers elect to join or not join the cooperative; and assessments of the importance of different services provided by the cooperative. The findings show how the relative weight of specific incentives for cooperative membership can vary from one environment to another within the same nation. The most important finding is that maintaining sustainable smallholder cooperatives within an increasingly competitive environment depends on the ability of managers to create business strategies that are compatible with the cooperative's environmental constraints but, at the same time, incentivize members' patronage.

TI  - Sustained LPG use requires progress on broader development outcomes
T2  - NATURE ENERGY
AB  - Messages for Policy
   Although LPG use has increased since 2014-15, the lower odds of PMUY households using LPG as the primary or exclusive cooking fuel imply that further targeted interventions are needed to facilitate a complete and sustained energy transition. In areas with low LPG uptake, government schemes on rural livelihoods and employment guarantees should converge with LPG promotion to enable predictable cash flows (to pay for LPG refills) among rural households. Village-level targeting of LPG promotion could be an efficient approach in laggard areas to promote sustained use through community-level awareness campaigns and improved LPG availability. Promoting the use of biomass in alternative value chains - thereby creating an opportunity cost for free-of-cost biomass - will be critical to the cessation of solid fuel use in rural households.
   While the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana has been instrumental in increasing India's liquefied petroleum gas adoption, sustained use depends on factors such as regularity of income and ease of access to free-of-cost biomass. To ensure sustained use after adoption, interventions in clean cooking energy must tie in with broader rural development.

TI  - How Inclusive Is Inclusive? A Critical Analysis of an Agribusiness Initiative in Kenya
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Inclusive agribusiness considers social and environmental goals in global value chains in agribusiness. However, not all small-scale farmers may be able to benefit from such arrangements. To find out about possible reasons for exclusion, this study investigates an agribusiness initiative in coastal Kenya employing organic contract farming by applying a mixed-methods research design based on household sampling of the recruitment procedure, as well as interviews with the farmers and company representatives. The findings suggest that sustainability standards may impede small-scale farmers' participation in agribusiness. Specifically, the implementation of organic certification, essential for the functionality of the company business models, contributes most to small-scale farmer exclusion. Companies, clients, and, most importantly, certifiers should be aware of this problem and look for appropriate measures to overcome this unwanted effect of standard-setting in inclusive businesses.

TI  - Export-Driven, Extensive Coastal Aquaculture Can Benefit Nutritionally Vulnerable People
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Export-orientated shrimp and prawn farming in coastal ghers has been associated with negative environmental, social, and nutritional impacts. This study challenges these perceptions based on field observations from four communities in South West Bangladesh. Most households observed (>60%) were either directly involved in seafood farming or engaged elsewhere in the seafood value chain. Our study set out to establish how the type and location of aquaculture impacted on access to and consumption of aquatic animals. Additionally, we assessed the effects of both household socioeconomic status and intra-household food allocation on individual diet and nutritional outcomes. We used a blended approach, including a 24-h consumption recall on two occasions, analysis of the proximate composition of aquatic animals and biomarkers from whole blood from a sample of the target population. The diverse polyculture systems generated broad social benefits, where "export-oriented" production actually supplied more food locally than to global markets. Key findings: (1) worse-off households achieved higher productivity of farmed aquatic animals on smaller landholding than better-off households with larger landholdings; (2) vegetable production on gher dikes was a significant source of nutrition and income in lower saline gradients; (3) more fish was eaten in lower saline gradients although fish consumption was highly variable within and between households; (4) intra-household allocation of specific foods within diets were similar across communities; (5) recommended nutrient intakes of protein and zinc exceeded daily requirements for adolescent females, but energy, calcium, and iron were below recommended intake levels; (6) n-3 LC-PUFA, expressed as percentage of total fatty acids, in whole blood samples of adolescent females declined with ambient salinity level regardless of household socioeconomic status; (7) analysis of aquatic animals consumed found that mangrove species and tilapia harvested from higher saline ghers contained high levels of desirable PUFAs. These findings suggest that export-driven, extensive coastal aquaculture can be nutrition sensitive when co-products are retained for local consumption.

TI  - Practices of traditional beef farmers in their production and marketing of cattle in Zambia
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - Understanding the practices of traditional cattle farmers in developing countries is an important factor in the development of appropriate, pro-poor disease control policies, and in formulating regional-specific production incentives that can improve productivity. This paper describes the production, husbandry practices, economics, and constraints of traditional cattle farming in Zambia. A cross-sectional study design was used to obtain data from traditional cattle farmers (n = 699) using a structured questionnaire. Data analyses were carried out using SPSS and STATA statistical packages. The results revealed that the majority [65% (95% CI: 59.3-71.1)] of farmers practised a transhumant cattle herding system under communal grazing. In these transhumant herding systems, animal husbandry and management systems were found to be of poor quality, in terms of supplementary feeding, vaccination coverage, deworming, uptake of veterinary services, usage of artificial insemination, and dip tanks all being low or absent. East Coast Fever was the most common disease, affecting 60% (95% CI: 56.4-63.7) of farmers. Cattle sales were low, as farmers only sold a median of two cattle per household per year. Crop farming was found to be the main source of farm income (47%) in agro-pastoralist communities, followed by cattle farming (28%) and other sources (25%). The median cost of production in the surveyed provinces was reported at US$316, while that of revenue from cattle and cattle products sales was estimated at US$885 per herd per year. This translates to an estimated gross margin of US$569, representing 64.3% of revenue.
   There is considerable diversity in disease distribution, animal husbandry practices, economics, and challenges in traditional cattle production in different locations of Zambia. Therefore, to improve the productivity of the traditional cattle sub-sector, policy makers and stakeholders in the beef value chain must develop fit-for-purpose policies and interventions that consider these variations.

TI  - Beef traders' and consumers' perceptions on the development of a natural pasture-fed beef brand by smallholder cattle producers in South Africa
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE
AB  - Beef traders' and consumers' perceptions on the development of a natural pasture-fed beef (NPB) brand by smallholder cattle producers were investigated. In total, 18 meat traders (five abattoirs and 13 beef retailers) and 155 beef consumers were interviewed using structured questionnaires. All meat traders had the potential but were not willing to support the development of a NPB brand citing smallholder farmers' limited ability to supply sufficient volumes of high-quality cattle. Consumers (81%) were prepared to purchase NPB upon availability on the market but were not willing (80%) to pay a brand premium. Logistic regression model results showed that consumers' willingness to buy NPB and pay a premium were influenced (P < 0.05) by gender, household size, income source, meat preference, meat consumption frequency, money spent on beef, frequency of beef purchases and consumption. Overall, beef traders and consumers held positive impressions regarding the development of a NPB brand by smallholder cattle producers but were not willing to support its development. Positive impressions held by value chain partners on the development of a NPB brand provide a basis for advancing development of a NPB brand. Initial efforts should enhance farmers' capacity to supply sufficient volumes of high-quality cattle.

AB  - Irrigation is a priority development agenda item in Ghana and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. There is a genuine endeavor to increase public and large-scale private investment in the sector. The on-going smallholder-driven private irrigation development that is largely based on water lifting technologies is not yet fully appreciated. We propose that smallholders themselves can play a significant role in achieving national irrigation development plans, provided they have access to water lifting technologies, especially small motorized pumps. We analyze adoption patterns and constraints pertaining to water lifting technologies in Ghana and suggest interventions that would enhance wider dissemination. Currently, these technologies are largely accessible only to better-off farmers. The primary factors inhibiting wider application are poorly developed supply chains, lack of access to finance, high operational and maintenance costs, high output price risks, and lack of institutional support. To realize the potential of water lifting technologies, improvements are required in the entire value chain of lift irrigation systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Contested commons: Agricultural modernization, tenure ambiguities and intra-familial land grabbing in Ghana
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Agricultural land in northern Ghana is a common pool resource predominantly governed by longstanding customary land tenure provisions. Following the renewed emphasis at achieving a new green revolution for Africa since the last decade, the government of Ghana has prioritized the provision of improved land preparation technologies to smallholder farmers. Although the uptake of these technologies has introduced speed and efficiency in land preparation, there are concerns about the impacts on customary land tenure systems. Drawing on the experiences of smallholder farmers (n = 60) in northern Ghana using in-depth interviews, we examine the dynamics in contemporary agricultural land access and governance following decades of progressive agricultural modernization. Our findings show that agricultural modernization has intensified agricultural land use and exposed the customary land governance system to more rival claims over agricultural commons that were previously owned and cultivated collectively under the extended family system. Given the current ambiguities in the interpretation of customary tenure and concomitant intra-familial land grabbing among smallholder farmers which we term 'intimate dispossession', most farmers have resorted to diverse personal tenure protection strategies towards enhancing their land use rights at the expense of co-family members. We advocate a land reform that prioritizes formal registration of agricultural lands to avoid future ambiguities in ownership and a cycle of farmland take-overs. With increasing pressure from other competing land uses, land banking should be prioritized to ensure tenure security for smallholder farmers, particularly weaker social groups and individuals within families who are often at risk of infra-familial land grabbing.

TI  - Choice of Contract Farming Strategies, Productivity, and Profits: Evidence from High-Value Crop Production
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - This study examines the impact of the choice of contract farming (CF) conditions on the productivity and profitability of ginger growers. Using farm-level data from Nepal and the selectivity-corrected multinomial endogenous switching regression (MESR) method, we found that ginger growers increased yields by 16%, 19%, and 15% by participating in CF with input conditions (IC), with output conditions (OC), and with input and output conditions (BC), respectively. Ginger growers also increased profits by participating in CF. Price difference in spot and contract markets, distance to market and transportation facilities, and farm location are important factors affecting participation in any form of CF.

TI  - Opportunities and constraints for adoption of maize-legume mixed cropping systems in Laos
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Land use and land cover have rapidly changed in Kham basin, northern Laos, with a rapid expansion of maize cultivated area. While maize monoculture has contributed to reduce rural poverty, many farmers are now confronted to declining yields, indebtedness, rising health and environmental concerns. Interventions at two different stages of the maize boom, i.e. expansion-intensification and distress-diversification phases, allowed capturing the main drivers of change in maize production systems, and assessing opportunities and constraints for the adoption of more sustainable maize-legume mixed systems. The successive innovations in maize cropping systems, i.e. introduction of hybrid seeds, motorized tillage, herbicides, service provision, planters, and mineral fertilizers, were mainly driven by productivity and profitability objectives. Farmers' interest in maize-legume mixed systems was low during maize expansion-intensification phase. The decline in maize profitability and new market outlets for legumes open new opportunity windows for maize-legume mixed systems. Yet, farmers' adoption of such systems is limited by (i) local perceptions of legumes as cash crops only, and (ii) farmers' least effort strategies that includes e.g. heavy herbicide use and livestock free roaming after maize harvest. Large-scale adoption of maize-legume mixed systems requires innovative intervention mechanisms to engage local stakeholders into redesigning their landscapes and value-chains.

TI  - Trends in Tobacco Production and Prices in Malawi
T2  - NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH
AB  - Introduction Diversification away from tobacco production has been identified as a priority for Malawi, historically one of the world's most tobacco-reliant countries. Methods This paper refers to a nationally representative data set to characterize broad trends in production since 2000 to understand whether Malawi is shifting away from tobacco and how production has changed over time. Results From 2004 to 2019, the share of Malawian crop farmers producing tobacco fell from 16% to 5%, and tobacco's share of the total value of crop production also declined sharply. Tobacco farms are generally growing larger (in size and scale of production) over time. However, land productivity remains low, with net returns of 93 000 MWK (128 USD) per hectare at the median. Farm-gate prices for tobacco have declined relative to the prices of maize or fertilizer, rendering tobacco a less lucrative avenue to generate the cash income needed to purchase these key items. In addition, the share of the export price received by farmers has also declined over time, with the median farm-gate price representing 32% of the export price in 2004 and 18% in 2019. Conclusions In some respects, a transition away from tobacco has already occurred. Additional research is needed to understand why the farm-gate share of tobacco export prices has declined over this period and how the livelihoods of smallholder farm-households that exited tobacco production have been affected. Implications To the extent that tobacco prices appear to be declining, there is a need to rigorously assess whether farmers have suitable crop alternatives (with established markets) and other livelihood options. Likely, investments are yet needed to foster strong alternatives to tobacco; such investments include research and development in on-farm technologies to raise the productivity of non-tobacco crops, as well as improvements in non-tobacco value chains to reduce transportation costs and promote private investment.

TI  - The ambiguity of transparency in the artisanal and small-scale mining sector of Tanzania
T2  - EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB  - This paper examines the newly established mineral markets in Tanzania. These markets aim to ensure tax revenue collection and enhance the transparency of mineral trade within the artisanal and small-scale mining sector. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in the Geita Region, we show that the enhanced transparency facilitated by these new markets has benefitted artisanal and small-scale gold miners. However, the living conditions of the miners and opportunities for profit have not changed significantly and the miners do not expect that a more transparent value chain will improve their lives. Many miners continue to depend on sponsorships from more powerful actors, which narrows their ability to profit from transparent market structures. Based on these findings, we discuss the ambiguity of transparency, as its transformative potentials are both important and limited and we argue that transparency for small-scale producers is not a straightforward path towards their empowerment.

TI  - Mungbean as a catch crop for dryland systems in Pakistan and Uzbekistan: A situational analysis
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - Mungbean (Vigna radiata (L). Wilczek) is a hardy early-maturing legume that can be used as a catch crop in the wheat and rice systems of South and Central Asia. To facilitate increased production, this study surveyed 345 mungbean growers and 336 non-growers in areas of Pakistan and Uzbekistan where there is potential for expansion. Low seed quality, low farmer awareness of the effect of mungbean on soil fertility, and high labor costs are identified as common constraints. In Pakistan, pests and diseases are a major constraint while low market demand is particularly a problem for farmers in Uzbekistan. Farm households were found to have little knowledge of the health benefits from mungbean consumption. It is therefore a priority to give farmers access to quality seed of improved varieties and to combine this with value chain development in Uzbekistan while promoting the benefits of mungbean to soil quality, incomes and human nutrition.

TI  - Leveraging the Vertical: The Contested Dynamics of Sustainability Standards and Labour in Global Production Networks
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
AB  - Sustainability standards for tropical agriculture promise better trade and fairer labour conditions for smallholders. Recent research on labour suggests that, besides such standards, configurations of buyer-supplier relationships crucially shape economic and labour conditions. However, a static configurational approach overlooks the role of supplier and labour agency over time. Using a matched case comparison of two certified rural enterprises in Ecuador, this article shows that suppliers can leverage standards to create value from vertical relationships with buyers. However, standards do not, by themselves, directly contribute to better conditions. They do so indirectly only if suppliers manage to become competitive in an elite market, augmenting rather than dampening unequal trade conditions. This study contributes to recent theory seeking to explain uneven labour outcomes with sustainability standards in global production networks.

TI  - Building Trustworthy Relationships with Smallholder(Small-scale) Agro-commodity Suppliers: Insights from the Ghana Cocoa Industry
T2  - JOURNAL OF MACROMARKETING
AB  - The purpose of the study is to investigate which factors lead firms should consider in their quest to build trustworthy supply relationships with agro-commodity suppliers. We developed a model of opportunism-trust relationships, which we analyzed in the context of a smallholder agro-commodity supply market (SHACSM). The data source is a survey of 444 buyer-supplier relationships from the cocoa industry of Ghana. The analysis shows that relational satisfaction, cooperation and information exchange reduce perceptions of opportunism consistent with the literature. However, multigroup analysis suggests differences in perception between men and women farm owners/managers. While men perceived the important role of information exchange in reducing perceptions of opportunism, women farm owners/managers were more concerned about the negative consequence of opportunism on trust. We discuss implications for theory, public policy, and macromarketing practice, and suggest options for future research.

TI  - On farm risk factors associated with goat milk quality in Northeast Brazil
T2  - SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH
CP  - 10th International Conference on Goats - Technological Development and Associate Attempts to a Sustainable Small Livestock Activity
AB  - Goat milk is an important component of nutrition in semi-arid regions. Production in Paraiba State is primarily supported by government agencies and often used in social programs such as "Fome Zero", a project intended to improve the nutritional status of the population in underdeveloped areas. However, private market access is a core necessity for the long-term sustainability of smallholder producers in the goat milk value chain. The aim of this study was to provide a baseline investigation into the microbiological and physicochemical traits of goat milk produced in northeastern Brazil in order to support intervention measures for prevention and control of foodborne pathogens. Bulk milk samples from 96 family producers were collected and analyzed quantitatively for aerobic mesophilic bacteria, total coliforms and Staphylococcus spp., and qualitatively for Salmonella enterica. Somatic cell counts and milk composition in terms of protein, fat, and dry extract were also determined. The results indicate high bacterial counts in raw milk. Aerobic mesophilic counts higher than 5 x 10(5) CFU/ml were found in 62.5% of the samples. Mean coliform and Staphylococcus counts were 1.2 x 10(6) and 1.9 x 10(6) CFU/ml, respectivey. S. enterica was detected in two (2.1%) samples. Somatic cell counts higher than 1 x 10(6) cells/ml were found in 87.5% farms. Possible risk factors associated with mesophilic aerobic bacteria, coliform. Escherichia coli and staphylococci counts were identified. These results indicate the need to reduce bacteriological counts in raw milk and further investigate potential associations with mastitis in this region. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Adoption of food safety measures: The role of bargaining and processing producer organizations
T2  - NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Increasing demand for safe food in developing countries entails meeting stringent food safety requirements. Food retailers and regulatory bodies impose food safety measures related to production and handling of farm produce. For smallholders to remain competitive in such a system, institutional arrangements are necessary. We examine the role of producer organizations (POs) in influencing safe food production behaviours among farmers. Using data from 11 expert interviews and a quantitative survey involving 595 smallholder dairy farmers in Kenya, a propensity score matching estimation is employed to assess membership effects. We show that membership in POs positively and significantly influences smallholders' adoption of food safety measures related to milk storage and the milking area. We highlight the importance of social incentives in improving food safety adoption among farmers even when price incentives are absent. Our recommendation is that PO policies that alleviate barriers to food safety adoption among farmers will be helpful in scaling up adoption.

TI  - Collectivization of smallholder farmers, strategic competition, and market performance: Experiences from two selected villages of West Bengal, India
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - Given the structure and functioning of agricultural markets and the policies and institutional space, smallholder farmers in India often face the risks of strategic failures, which force them to either opt for distress selling, operate as fringe retailers or participate in the existing supply or value chains on given conditions. In this perspective, this paper examines if smallholder farmers' collectives can potentially strengthen their market position vis-a-vis other individual players and enable them to explore strategic options in a greater way. On the basis of the structure-conduct-performance theory and field experiences from two selected villages of West Bengal (India), the paper finds that the collectivization of smallholder farmers helps in exploring a larger set of strategic options for better outcomes. Further, the choice of the strategy set varies across the collectives depending on their composition, functioning, and resource endowments. Nevertheless, there is a possibility of strategic failures because of intra- as well as intercollective conflicts and competition from other players. The success in this regard would, therefore, depend on how the collectives democratically resolve such conflicts and develop capacity and capabilities to enhance their competitiveness for greater strategic success. Besides, addressing market imperfections through policy and institutional interventions would also be crucial.

TI  - 'Control Grabbing' and small-scale agricultural intensification: emerging patterns of state-facilitated 'agricultural investment' in Rwanda
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - The Rwandan government's ongoing reconfiguration of the agricultural sector seeks to facilitate increased penetration of smallholder farming systems by domestic and international capital, which may include some land acquisition ('land grabbing') as well as contract farming arrangements. Such contracts are arranged by the state, which sometimes uses coercive mechanisms and interventionist strategies to encourage agricultural investment. The Rwandan government has adapted neo-liberal tools, such as 'performance management contracts', which make local public administrators accountable for agricultural development targets (often explicitly linked to corporate interests). Activities of international development agencies are becoming intertwined with those of the state and foreign capital, so that a variety of actors and objectives are starting to collaboratively change the relations between land and labour. The global 'land grab' is only one aspect of broader patterns of reconfiguration of control over land, labour and markets in the Global South. This paper demonstrates the ways in which the state is orienting public resources towards private interests in Rwanda, through processes that have elsewhere been termed 'control grabbing' [Borras et al. 2012, 402-416].

TI  - Improved storage technique and management of aflatoxin in peanut production: Evidence from Northern Ghana
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB  - Peanut production contributes to food security in northern Ghana due to its ability to tolerate drought and survive on marginal lands. This notwithstanding, poor handling along the value chain favors aflatoxin contamination, a threat to human and animal life. Farmerled improved storage practice, a potential solution to aflatoxin contamination, have been promoted in northern Ghana. However, there is limited evidence on the factors influencing the use of the improved storage system that may guide dissemination efforts. Using the Cragg's two stage model, our results show that the probability and intensity of adopting the improved storage structure is principally and significantly influenced by economic active household members, storing of peanut in other places relative to the field, and location of farmer residence. In disseminating the improved peanut storage structure, the identified factors must be incorporated in the selection criteria to ensure maximum uptake and usage. Farmer training programs that incorporate both good agronomic practices and good storage practices must be intensified to reduce postharvest losses due to aflatoxin contamination. These strategies will help mitigate the harmful effect of aflatoxin, ensure economic sustainability, and enhance food security. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Exploring the relationships between trade in natural products, cash income and livelihoods in tropical forest regions of Eastern India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - Rural development interventions and conservation of resources in forested regions can be better informed with improved understanding of natural product trading and associated livelihood dynamics that operate mostly in informal economic settings. This study examined the income generating potential or six commercially traded forest products, i.e. Mahua flower (Madhuca latifolia), Lac (Kerria lacca), Bidi (processed leaf of Diospyros melanoxylon), oil seeds (Madhuca latifolia, Buchanania lanzan), Sal leaf (Shorea robusta) and Tendu leaf (Diospyros melanoxylon) in a dry deciduous forest region of India, and their significance in household economies. The rural poor were found to have diverse livelihood strategies where NTFP trading contributes on average 20% of cash income. The financial benefit accruing to households in NTFP commercialization are not uniform, and were impacted by entrepreneurship ability and value addition rather than family resources and period of trading engagement. Households trading in Bidi rolling alone could make as much as 60% of total household cash income that indicates the importance of designing policy to support marketing or NTFPs tailored to each value chain.

TI  - Multi-dimensional poverty effects around operational biofuel projects in Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB  - There is a long-term concern that the cultivation of biofuel feedstocks could have negative impacts on communities involved in, or adjacent to, such projects. In southern Africa, the acquisition and allocation of large blocks of land for biofuel feedstock production has been especially contentious. The present study investigates the local multi-dimensional poverty effects of growing biofuel crops using the Oxford Poverty & Human Development Initiative's Multidimensional Poverty Index. It investigates different modes of production (large-scale vs. smallholder-based) and different feedstocks (sugarcane vs. jatropha) in four study sites in Malawi, Swaziland and Mozambique. In the sugarcane growing areas, those who participated in its value chain as farmers or workers had lower poverty than those who were not involved. However, for jatropha growing areas, there were no clearly defined differences between the controls and the jatropha farmers in Mangochi, while in Mozambique the plantation workers had slightly lower poverty than the control groups. Although it was not possible to make direct comparisons between all projects, sugarcane areas seem to be better off than non-sugarcane areas. In all projects there was generally high incidence of deprivations in indicators related to living standards, particularly, access to electricity and cooking fuel. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Existing value addition initiatives enhancing recognition of territorial traits of three Kenyan honey
T2  - JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AB  - Recognition of honeys with specific characteristics attributed to their territory (geographical origin) can enhance increased incomes to households in rural areas of Kenya, if protected and sold under Geographical Indications labels. This is mainly because product recognition can result in its demand, reputation, access to market and its protection from imitation and disappearance from the market. Initiatives undertaken by actors in the honey subsector and other sectors to promote recognition of Kenyan honeys and their territorial and local traits have not been documented. This study evaluated the existing value addition initiatives enhancing recognition of territorial or local traits of the three Kenyan honey, that is, honey from Kitui, West Pokot, and Baringo. Data collection methods used included literature review as well as interviews with relevant stakeholders in the honey subsector and other relevant sectors. Results showed that development of honey value chains, product certification, product promotional and marketing activities, and awareness on the link between product quality and geographical origin have greatly contributed to recognition of West Pokot, Baringo, and Kitui honey as well as their territorial traits.

TI  - Whither the pin factory? Modern food supply chains and specialization in India
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - What is the relationship between smallholder participation in modern food supply chains and their degree of economic specialization? We investigate this research question by looking at whether there is a systematic relationship between whether a household grows crops for a supermarket chain-participation in the supermarket channel-and how concentrated among fewer crops are that household's total landholdings and its output. Using longitudinal data from India, we find that there is no relationship between whether a household participates in the supermarket channel and that household's Herfindahl-Hirschman index for land, but there is a robust statistically significant and negative relationship between whether a household participates in the supermarket channel and that household's Herfindahl-Hirschman index for output. These findings hold true at both the extensive margin (i.e., when considering whether a household participates in the supermarket channel) and the intensive margin (i.e., when considering how much of a household's marketed output is sold through the supermarket chain). This suggests that instead of fostering a greater degree of specialization, participation in modern food supply chains might lead to greater diversification.

TI  - Frontier tourism development and inequality in the Nepal Himalaya
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
AB  - This article proposes 'frontier tourism development' as an apt analytical lens through which to understand contemporary tourism development in rural peripheries. Based on a rich case study of more than 90% of households across seven villages in the Manaslu Conservation Area, the article analyses local-level inequalities in participation and benefits from tourism development in one of the world's most remote peripheries-the high Himalayas of Nepal. The analysis documents that distance to the trekking trail running through the area significantly determines engagement in the tourism sector and that, among participating households, the wealthier obtain significantly more tourism income. These local-level findings show how development initiatives intended to engender a more equal distribution of tourism income at a regional scale may end up increasing income inequalities at a local scale. Interpreting these findings though the notion of frontier tourism development as a particular kind of commodity frontier, the article highlights challenges to market-oriented inclusive tourism development in the face of composite rural economies and rapidly changing livelihood conditions. It documents bubble-like barriers to trickle-down and backward linkages at the frontiers of tourism development; illustrates the need for broader analytical alternatives to dominant value chain approaches; and encourages a more robust integration between studies of rural tourism and the wider political economy perspectives of critical agrarian studies.

TI  - Land grabbing, social differentiation, intensified migration and food security in northern Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - This paper argues that large-scale land appropriation is displacing subsistence farmers and reworking agrarian social relations in northern Ghana. The recent wave of farmland enclosure has not only resulted in heightened land scarcity, but also fostered a marked social differentiation within farming communities. The dominant form of inequality is an evolving class of landless and near-landless farmers. The majority of households cope with such dynamics by deepening their own self-exploitation in the production process. The fulcrum of this self-exploitation is gendered property rights as part of the conjugal contract, with men exerting a far greater monopoly over land resources than had previously been the case. Due to acute land shortages, women's rights to use land as wives, mothers and daughters are becoming insecure, as their vegetable plots are being reclassified as male-controlled household fields. The paper further documents the painful choices that landless farmers have to make in order to meet livelihood needs, including highly disciplined, yet low-waged, farm labor work and sharecropping contracts. In these livelihood pathways, there emerge, again, exploitative relations of production, whereby surplus is expropriated from land dispossessed migrant laborers and concentrated with farm owners. These dynamics produce a 'simple reproduction squeeze' for the land-dispossessed. Overall, the paper contributes to the emerging land grabbing literature by showing geographically specific processes of change for large-scale mining operations and gendered differentiated impacts.

TI  - Decoupling from international food safety standards: how small-scale indigenous farmers cope with conflicting institutions to ensure market participation
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - Although inclusion in formal value chains extends the prospect of improving the livelihoods of rural small-scale producers, such a step is often contingent on compliance with internationally-promoted food safety standards. Limited research has addressed the challenges this represents for small rural producers who, grounded in culturally-embedded food safety conceptions, face difficulties in complying. We address this gap here through a multiple case study involving four public school feeding programs that source meals from local rural providers in the Bolivian Altiplan. Institutional logics theory is used to describe public food safety regulations and to compare them to food safety conceptions in the local indigenous Aymara rural setting. We identify a value-based conflict that leads to non-compliance of formal food safety rules that jeopardizes the participation of small farmers in the market. These include: (1) partial adoption of formal rules; (2) selective adoption of convenient rules; and (3) ceremonial adoption to avoid compliance. Decoupling strategies allow local actors to largely disregard the formal food safety regulations while accommodating traditional cultural practices and continuing to access the market. However, these practices put the long-term sustainability of the farmers' participation in potentially favorable opportunities at risk.

TI  - Socio-economic differentiation from a class-analytic perspective: The case of smallholder tree-crop farmers in Limpopo, South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE
AB  - South African agrarian policy aims to integrate smallholder tree-crop farmers into high-end value chains with growth and employment potential, generally neglecting socio-economic differentiation amongst them. This paper aims to analyse socio-economic differentiation amongst tree-crop farmers in Vhembe District, Limpopo, using a class-based analysis based on livelihood diversification and accumulation. Cluster analysis of survey data and semi-structured interviews reveals that most tree-crop farmers engage in petty commodity production, internally differentiated by their combination of income sources and livelihood strategies. Farmers' ability to engage in accumulation and upward class mobility is generally severely constrained by limited access to capital. Agricultural diversification offers livelihood potential but limited possibility for accumulation, whereas salaried nonfarm work offers more promising prospects for accumulation but limited livelihood opportunities. A minority demonstrated characteristics of small-scale capitalist farmers, internally differentiated by their reliance on salaried employment or agricultural production. The findings challenge the notion of an undifferentiated class of market-oriented smallholders.

TI  - Opportunistic Behaviour and Trust: Experimental Results from Broccoli Farmers in Ecuador
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Linking smallholder farmers to high-value markets through contract farming has become an important strategy to increase farm incomes in developing countries. However, various forms of opportunistic behaviour have been reported, threatening the sustainability of inclusive supply chains. When formal institutions are weak, informal codes of conduct like trust can be important complements to facilitate market transactions. We explore the effect of opportunistic behaviour on farmers' trust, using a field-framed trust experiment with prior signaling with small-scale farmers in Ecuador. These farmers are linked to different types of markets, including high-value export chains, and have been exposed to varying levels of opportunistic behaviour in the past. Our unique dataset allows us to control for self-selection of game participants. We find that a positive signal triggers a positive response increasing trust, while a negative signal has no effect - possibly reflecting very low overall trust levels. In settings where market linkages have failed previously, ex-ante credible positive signals could help to build trust and encourage small farmers' participation in sustainable value chains.

TI  - Sacrificing the savannah woodlands for energy and livelihoods? Charcoal production in Ghana
T2  - ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The energy transition in many African countries involves the shift from firewood to charcoal and liquefied petro-leum gas (LPG) as the primary domestic energy source. In Ghana, the demand for charcoal is on the rise, leading to diverse socio-economic and ecological outcomes in the Savannah woodland. Based on data produced through interviews, focus group discussions, observation, and a survey with 200 questionnaires administered, the paper examines the dynamics of charcoal livelihoods for energy and the ecological effects in the Savana woodland of Ghana. The article shows that charcoal production is critical to meeting household energy needs, supports the livelihood of different categories of people along the value chain and transforms local economies with unequal benefit streams to different actors. However, charcoal production results in loss of vegetation and ecological resilience with different levels of culpability on large migrant producers and small survivalist indigene producers. The paper shows that vegetation loss is highest in areas where indigenous charcoal producers continue to produce after the large-scale producers migrate when they exhaust matured trees. We recommend that stakeholders rethink governance strategies toward regulating the charcoal sector, considering its critical role in meeting domestic energy needs and supporting the livelihoods of many people.(c) 2022 International Energy Initiative.

TI  - Best management practices for sustainable oil palm production: the case of smallholder farmers' adoption in Ghana
T2  - FORESTS TREES AND LIVELIHOODS
AB  - The economic potential of oil palm for Ghana and many other developing countries in the tropics is substantial but largely remain unharnessed. Employing both quantitative and qualitative methods including treatment effect models, this study examines the yield difference between adopters and non-adopters of oil palm Best Management Practices (BMPs) among a large number of smallholder farmers and how this may be shaped by factors mostly relating to sectoral innovation system challenges. We found fertiliser application to be the only BMP which independently had a statistically significant yield difference. However, we found further that the adoption of more than any five of the BMPs also had a significant yield difference even after one controls for the effect of fertiliser application. These results tend to vary by the size of the oil palm plots and also appear to be largely associated with differences in the commitment of the farmers to implementing the BMPs, their capacity to absorb the investment cost of adoption and their expected monetary returns on such investment, which are linked to challenges within the oil palm value chain and sectoral innovation system. Our quantitative results are stable under different estimation models and variations in control variables.

TI  - Governing Fair Trade Coffee Supply: Dynamics and Challenges in Small Farmers' Organizations
T2  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Farmers' organizations are essential actors in fair trade certification schemes, and therefore in delivering their associated benefits for poor small-scale farmers. However, the dynamics and challenges faced by these cooperative organizations have been largely bypassed in the fair trade literature. In this context, this paper aims to unpack the multiple, coexisting and interwoven marketing channels available for small-scale coffee producers, unveiling potential sources of uncertainty and tensions among competing actors and interests, and identifying and assessing the strategies used by organizations to influence farmers' marketing decisions. The analysis comprises two case studies based in the department of Huehuetenango (Guatemala), where the existence of distinct marketing channels combines with processes of product differentiation, namely organic production. Results show the limitations of standard fair trade mechanisms to secure farmers' engagement with cooperative organizations. Rather, technical advice to improve farming practices and quality construction seem to be a more effective mechanism to govern this collective supply chain. Nevertheless, these strategies could be further constrained by productive and organizational factors, affecting the sustainability of potential benefits delivered by these key collective actors.

TI  - The dynamics of horticultural export value chains on the livelihood of small farm households in Southern Ghana
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - Policy makers in developing countries have been concerned with the economic and political risks associated with heavy dependence on few specialized raw materials as main sources of government revenue and foreign exchange. Development partners and donor agencies have equally extolled the need for these countries to diversify their export base as a poverty reduction strategy. As a result, several African countries have tended to focus on non-traditional agricultural exports (NTEs) which reflect their comparative advantage and for many countries the export of horticultural crops has been favoured. This study focuses on a household survey undertaken in the forest and coastal savannah transition zones of Ghana, where the farming system has undergone a remarkable transition from an established system of food crop farming for sale to urban consumers to an intensive production of fruits and vegetable crops for export to European consumers. Econometric analysis shows that though export horticulture has a positive impact on the wellbeing of the majority of households, the chronically poor households are structurally impeded from seizing the available opportunities due to poor resource endowment and liquidity constraints.

TI  - Recognizing Determinants to Smallholders' Market Orientation and Marketing Arrangements: Building on a Case of Dairy Farming in Rural Kenya
T2  - LAND
AB  - Smallholder commercialization is central to international development policy and practice. As a result, several arrangements to foster market linkages are being implemented. Especially popular are farmers' organizations, which are believed to be owned, controlled, and financed by smallholders. As such, their design is considered inclusive given every household in a community is theoretically allowed to become a member, and the governance and management structure encourage participatory decision-making. However, even in the context in which farmers' organizations are actively promoted, a notable proportion of smallholders may not be able to engage in market-oriented production or may opt for the existing alternative marketing arrangements, as dictated by individual households' socioeconomic characteristics. Focusing on the case of smallholder farming in Olenguruone, Nakuru county, Kenya, where a donor funded dairy farmers' cooperative marketing arrangement is promoted alongside existing marketing opportunities, the present research investigated the factors that determine smallholders' commercial farming orientation and marketing arrangements. It employed a case study approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative research methods for a more complete empirical inquiry. The findings demonstrate that irrespective of the external support provided through marketing opportunities such as farmer organizations, smallholders' engagement in commercial farming and marketing is dictated by the socioeconomic attributes and market perceptions that are heterogeneous among households in a smallholder community.

TI  - Productivity differences between organic and other vegetable farming systems in northern Thailand
T2  - RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - We analyzed the productivity levels of smallholder farms in northern Thailand practicing different 'clean and safe' vegetable farming systems or conventional vegetable (CV) production. 'Clean and safe' farmers are categorized into three groups based on their use of synthetic chemicals: organic, pesticide-free and safe-use. Farm-level data on vegetable production were collected from random samples of farms operating these farming systems. A standard stochastic production frontier model and a metafrontier model were estimated for each system to obtain estimates of technical efficiency (TE) with respect to their cohorts, metatechnology ratios (MTRs, showing the extent of technology gaps between farming systems) and overall productivity measures. Productivity levels were found to vary moderately between farming systems. 'Clean and safe' farms achieved a higher mean TE score than conventional farms, indicating a more efficient use of inputs in producing a certain level of output within their system. However, their MTRs were significantly lower than those of conventional farmers, indicating greater production technology constraints because of the need to conform to strict guidelines. All four farming systems had at least one farmer who could overcome the technological constraints to achieve the highest possible output regardless of the technology used. Effective assistance providers were found to be crucial for farmers to achieve high productivity in the organic farming system. Improvements are needed to raise low productivity levels through technology transfer, value chain improvement and farmer capacity in production and marketing. The required improvement strategies differ among farming systems.

TI  - An empirical analysis of the use of agricultural mobile applications among smallholder farmers in Myanmar
T2  - ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AB  - Mobile phone applications (apps) designed to assist smallholder farmers improve decision-making have been revolutionizing the agriculture sector. These apps offer solutions to farmer information needs by providing weather information, crop market trends, pest and disease damage identification, and advice on pesticide and fertilizer use. They also facilitate interaction with fellow farmers, extension workers and other stakeholders in the value chain who are interested in information exchange. Much previous research has investigated the contribution of mobile apps to agricultural production. This study explored the agricultural mobile apps available in Myanmar, analyzed factors affecting their use and assessed the potential for farm-based decision support. Our findings indicate that when introducing mobile-based tools, focus should be given to younger, more educated farmers growing more specialized crops. The main constraints to adopt agricultural apps are lack of access to smartphone and/or internet (63%) and lack of digital knowledge (20%). However, smallholder farmers in Myanmar were optimistic and positive toward agricultural apps for effective utilization. We also found that majority of the surveyed farmers were familiar with information received through Facebook groups. Incorporating useful information and functions from an agricultural mobile app to a Facebook Page could have a more useful and sustainable impact.

TI  - Dairy Joint Ventures in South Africa's Land and Agrarian Reform Programme: Who Benefits?
T2  - LAND
AB  - Joint Ventures (JVs) between 'agribusiness' investors and 'small farmers' or 'customary landowners' are being promoted in South Africa's land and agrarian reform programme as a way to include land reform beneficiaries in the country's competitive agricultural sector. This paper undertakes an in-depth comparative analysis of two JV dairy farms located on irrigation schemes in the former 'homeland' of the Ciskei, in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province. The community, through government investment, brings the fixed assets to the business: land, irrigation infrastructure and milking parlours. The agribusiness partner or 'sharemilker' contributes the dairy cows and other movable assets. The paper explores what incentivizes agribusiness partners to enter into these types of 'sharemilking' JVs. The research reveals that investing in 'moveable assets' is more profitable for agribusiness and is also viewed as a more politically pragmatic way to arrange production in the context of land reform. These arrangements have led to further opportunities for investment in other parts of the dairy value chain. The social relations of production involved in sharemilking JVs also obscure class and race relations in ways that benefit agribusiness partners. Although beneficiaries are receiving benefits in the form of jobs and dividends, which in certain cases make notable contributions to household incomes, the structuring of sharemilking contracts is not a fair return on investment for the customary landowners. It is also argued that the JV model is at risk of equating 'black emerging farmers' with a group of 'beneficiaries' who are in reality workers and passive recipients of dividends and land rents.

TI  - Economic Feasibility of Tropical Forest Restoration Models Based on Non-Timber Forest Products in Brazil, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Peru
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Mobilizing funds is a major challenge to achieve scalable Forest Landscape Restoration projects. While pure ecological restoration may not be a feasible investment from the private perspective, combining native species with non-timber forest products (NTFP) species may be a solution for reaching large scale and financially sustainable forest restoration. This study addresses potential species combinations for 12 restoration models, three models being based in pure ecological restoration and nine models being based on agroforests with NTFP, their economic costs, and benefits in tropical forests in Brazil, Peru, Cambodia, and Indonesia. A total of 12 semi-structured interviews were conducted to capture the models' productivity and prices. As for the prices that the producers did not know, specialized stores were consulted in the cities of the collection. The starting investment to restore 01 hectare (ha(-1)) of tropical forest ranged between US $104 and $7736, with an average of $1963 ha(-1) and a standard deviation of $2196 ha(-1), considering the 12 cases evaluated in 2018 and 2019. From nine restoration models that had economic purposes, financial indicators showed a median net present value (NPV) of $1548 ha(-1), and a median internal rate of return of 22%, considering a discount rate of 10%. The NPV varied between $-685 ha(-1) and $55,531 ha(-1). Costs of pure ecological restoration were on average 42% lower than agroforestry systems, but did not produce direct income from NTFP, therefore yielding negative NPV. The study demonstrated the economic feasibility of seven of nine models that had economic objective, showing that there are promising business cases for private investment in tropical forest restoration.

TI  - Emerging Class Relations in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam: A Network Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE
AB  - Neoclassical theory has not succeeded in explaining the relationship between increasing landlessness and class differentiation in rural southern Vietnam. In this paper, we take a relational approach, using statistical techniques from social network theory, to examine the governance structure of markets in a commune of Tra Vinh province in the Mekong River Delta. We demonstrate that new opportunities provided by the process of market development are accessible only to those households controlling the right bundles of resources in the core agricultural production and trading system of the area. Further, industrial employment is available only to those who have, at some stage, controlled land, while those who have never participated in the land and rice markets are confined to casual agricultural labour. The governance structure, embedded informally in relatively stable market networks, therefore reproduces class divisions.

TI  - Factors affecting interactions between different key actors in improved rice varieties innovation system in the Eastern Zone of Tanzania
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study examines factors affecting the interactions between different key actors in the innovation system of improved rice varieties in the Eastern Zone of Tanzania. A parallel mixed design was used to collect the data from a sample of 340 randomly selected rice farming households and 34 purposively selected key informants from actor groups involved in rice innovations. Information was collected using structured and semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and documentary review. Factors affecting interactions between farmers and other key actors were analyzed using a binary logistic model and chi-square test, meanwhile, content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data. The findings show that household income, farming systems, leadership, innovation platforms, coordination bodies, trust, human and financial resources, ICT facilities, and transportation means were the factors that affected interactions between different actors in the system. Equally, limited financial resources were reported to have affected every actor group's ability to interact in the system, thus significantly constraining the implementation of linkage activities designed to facilitate actors' interactions along the improved rice varieties value chain. This study speaks to policymakers on formulating strategies for financial resource mobilization that will strengthen availability and accessibility of finance by actors and enable the implementation of linkage activities (e.g., innovation platform establishment, enhancement of ICT facilities, and improvement of transport means, among others) which, in turn, will strengthen actors' interactions in the system and improve rice production.

TI  - Digital Technology and Services for Sustainable Agriculture in Tanzania: A Literature Review
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Digital technology has the potential to eradicate extreme poverty and food insecurity to the majority of smallholder farmers in the world. This paper aims to identify knowledge gaps on digital technology for sustainable agriculture and assess their availability to smallholder farmers worldwide. The particular case of Tanzania receives special attention. We conducted an extensive literature search from relevant databases for review. The advanced digital technology in agriculture, mostly used by large scale farmers, significantly contributes to sustainable agriculture. However, the existing digital services for smallholder farmers lack sustainability in the agriculture context and hardly meet the needs for a comprehensive set of services in a complete farming cycle. In most developing countries, Tanzania case included, digital technology and services respond to a challenge at a particular stage of the farming process or to a specific value chain. Based on this literature review, we identify inequalities among large and small farmers, as well as environmental challenges caused by ICT itself. To conclude we provide suggestions for improvements for smallholder farmers: developing a digital platform that addresses smallholder farmers' challenges in a complete farming cycle, bringing together the stakeholders at a country level, in order to achieve sustainable agriculture and support adoption of cutting-edge digital technology. These suggestions will be the starting point for future research.

TI  - HIV and AIDS vulnerability in fishing communities in Mangochi district, Malawi
T2  - AJAR-AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AIDS RESEARCH
AB  - The fisheries sector contributes significantly to Malawi's national economy and to the livelihoods of the poor as certain activities in the sector have relatively low barriers to entry. Various studies have shown that the fisheries sector suffers from high HIV prevalence in many low-income countries. In Malawi, HIV prevalence as well as the causes and impact of HIV infections among fisherfolk are yet to be assessed. Participatory action research was conducted in Mangochi District, in the southern part of Lake Malawi, between December 2007 and January 2008, to identify critical HIV-risk points along the value-chain for the Lake Sardine or usipa (Engraulicypris sardella) fishery. Data were collected through interviews with key informants and from focus group discussions at the community, institution, district and market levels. An analysis of vulnerability resulted in the formulation of mechanisms to redress HIV and AIDS prevention and mitigation at each point of vulnerability. The findings show that HIV and AIDS vulnerability in the fishery's market-chain is highest where fish processing and trading influence sexual relationships between fishermen and female fish traders. The period of high usipa catches ( December to March) coincides with a period of food shortage and fishing offers income-generating opportunities for many food-insecure households. This increases competition in processing and trading fish, a socio-economic situation that may result in increased instances of transactional sex. The interactions along the usipa fishery's market-chain, from rural to urban settings, also favour the transmission of HIV from areas of high prevalence to areas with otherwise low HIV risk.

TI  - How Capital Endowment and Ecological Cognition Affect Environment-Friendly Technology Adoption: A Case of Apple Farmers of Shandong Province, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Ever-increasing global environmental issues, land degradation, and groundwater contamination may significantly impact the agricultural sector of any country. The situation worsens while the global agricultural sectors are going through the unsustainable intensification of agricultural production powered by chemical fertilizers and pesticides. This trend leads the sector to exercise environmentally friendly technology (EFT). Capital endowment and ecological cognition may significantly impact fostering farmers' adoption of environmentally friendly technology. The government also tends to change the existing policies to cope with ever-increasing challenges like pollution control, maintaining ecological balance, and supporting agricultural sectors substantially by employing ecological compensation policy. The study's main objective is to explore the impacts of farmer's ecological compensation, capital endowment, and ecological cognition for the adoption of EFT. The empirical setup of the study quantifies with survey data of 471 apple farmers from nine counties of Shandong province. The study used Heckman's two-stage model to craft the findings. The results showed that 52.02% of fruit farmers adopted two environmentally friendly technologies, and 23.99% of fruit farmers adopted three forms of environmentally friendly technologies. At the same time, we have traced that the capital endowment, planting scale, family income, and technical specialization of fruit farmers significantly impact adopting EFT. The study also revealed that understanding ecological compensation policy has a significant positive effect on adopting environmentally friendly technology. Seemingly, ecological compensation policy has a specific regulatory effect on fruit farmers' capital endowment and ecological cognition. Therefore, it is necessary to extend the demonstration facilities, training, and frequently arrange awareness-building campaigns regarding rural non-point source pollution hazards and improve the cognition level of farmers. The agriculture extension department should strengthen the agricultural value chain facilities to make farmers fully realize the importance of EFT. Government should promote and extend the supports for availing new and innovative EFT at a reasonable price. Moreover, cooperative, financial, and credit organizations need to lead for the smooth transition of EFT. The agricultural cooperatives and formal risk-taking networks should act responsibly for shaping the behavioral factors of farmers.

TI  - Measuring Livelihood Diversification and Forest Conservation Choices: Insights from Rural Cameroon
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - While forests' contribution to rural livelihoods has been unearthed scientifically, the patterns, determinants and forest conservation policy implications of livelihood diversification still beg for more scientific and policy edification. This paper makes a contribution in this regard, using household data (N = 200) from eight villages around the Kilum-Ijim Forest Landscape of Cameroon. The ordinary least square and the logit model are used to explore the determinants of livelihood diversification and the likelihood of forest dependence, respectively. The diversification patterns were analysed using a simple t-test, and the multinomial logit for conservation choices. We find that forest-related activities are a source of livelihood diversification for 63% of households, with non-timber forest products (NTFP) domestication (31%) and medicinal plant extraction (30%) being the most preferred. For non-forest activities, migration is the most preferred diversification strategy. Generally, households with favourable socio-economic status prefer non-forest to forest activities for livelihood diversification. The regression estimates indicate that older respondents are more likely to depend on the forest than the young, whereas males and individuals with at least some secondary education are less likely than their respective counterparts to rely on the forest. The results also suggest those who participated in training, educated household heads and older individuals are significantly more likely to choose high-valued diversification strategies. Concerning conservation activities, households with favourable socio-economic status are on average less likely to adopt NTFP domestication and more likely to adopt bee-keeping as a conservation choice. The results suggest the need for policy considerations to: (i) effectively integrate women in forest management processes, (ii) intensify trainings for conservation-friendly diversification approaches, (iii) regulate unclean energy use and (iv) encourage value chain improvement for conservation-friendly products.

TI  - Assessment of stakeholders' roles and linkages in quality coffee production in Yirgacheffe District, southern Ethiopia: Implications for local adaptation to climate change
T2  - NORSK GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-NORWEGIAN JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
AB  - The study objective is to assess stakeholders' roles and linkages in quality coffee production and the implications for adaptation to climate change in Yirgacheffe District, southern Ethiopia. Stakeholder analysis was performed to identify and characterize stakeholders based on their power and interest criteria and to assess their linkages and roles in quality coffee production. Additionally, a household survey with coffee farmers (stratified into quality coffee farmers and conventional coffee farmers) was conducted to assess coffee farmers' level of satisfaction of with various forms of support provided to them by the stakeholders. The stakeholders analysis revealed that stakeholders possessed different degrees of power and interest in quality coffee production. While government agencies were more powerful in decisions and actions related to quality coffee production, coffee farmers (key actors) were less powerful. The household survey revealed that quality coffee farmers tended to have stronger linkages with stakeholders than conventional coffee farmers. The authors conclude that quality coffee production was the result of efforts from multiple stakeholders, and they suggest that policy interventions to enhance collaborative quality coffee production through empowering stakeholders in decision-making processes in the coffee value chain are important to make the coffee-based livelihoods sustainable and resilient to climate change.

TI  - Fresh Product Supply Chain Analysis in Cauca, Colombia - A Hass Avocado System Dynamics Approach
T2  - SYSTEMS
AB  - In recent years, agriculture has become an essential activity in Colombia, despite the challenges faced by farmers due to low yields and insufficient resources to improve their main activities, such as irrigation systems, agricultural practices, and industrial machinery. This Hass avocado approach has been addressed in previous research considering system dynamics simulation to evaluate farmers' behavior strategies and improve their competitiveness. However, these studies typically examine a single strategy effect and avoid multiple integrated strategies. Other studies focused on the complex interactions between different factors in the production chain and their feedback effects on farmers' productivity and cash flow. For these reasons, this research provides a comprehensively dynamic model and evaluates long-term strategies and their effects on supporting and improving small farmers' productivity and profitability. A system dynamics methodology was used to model complex systems processing Hass avocado farmer association data and explore their effects on competitiveness for long-term sustainable and profitable agriculture. This research proposes optimal scenarios for small farmers, including strategies such as low-interest credit access, logistics practices, and government technical support. The scenarios provide a proactive tool for decision makers and promote rural farmers' development, aligning high-quality fresh product supply and demand.

TI  - ScalA-FS: expert-based ex-ante assessments of local requirements and success potential of upgrading strategies for improving food security in rural Tanzania
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Enhancing food security is the main goal of subsistence farmers, who are vulnerable to food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa. Participatory research across food value chains (FVC) can help stabilize and enhance food security by developing upgrading strategies (UPS). However, prior to successful widespread adoption and geographical upscaling, such practices need in-depth understanding of their suitability in target areas and their particular local requirements. Ex-ante assessments of selected UPS were carried out by German and Tanzanian agricultural scientists using the "ScalA-FS" tool. The participating experts included those responsible for implementation. The tool aims to systematically evaluate, at the community level, UPS that have been successfully implemented elsewhere, evaluate their potential for dissemination, and identify entry points for adjustments during implementation. Assessment indicators were developed through a participatory process. UPS relate to a) natural resource management and crop production; b) food processing and bioenergy; c) income generation and market participation; and d) food consumption. Here we present the ScalA-FS assessment results on UPS suitability as well as on its implementation requirements. We focused on the local context needed to enable a productive collaboration between smallholder farmers and implementing research and/or development organizations. Implementation requirements for the selected UPS were assessed as generally low to medium, and projected suitability in most cases was high. Local knowledge and education (human capital) along with visible success after a short time were important criteria of success of UPS. Here, careful consideration of the challenges before and after implementation of UPS is suggested. ScalA-FS should be applied early in the implementation process of UPS in order to support adaptations and successful upscaling at other locations.

TI  - How Effective is Multiple Certification in Improving the Economic Conditions of Smallholder Farmers? Evidence from an Impact Evaluation in Colombia's Coffee Belt
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - Voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) in the coffee sector have become a popular tool to improve the livelihoods of smallholder coffee farmers. As third-party and company-led VSS have proliferated, an increasing number of producer groups are turning toward multiple certification to diversify their export channels. Yet, each certification requires added efforts and expenses, both at the farm and the organisational level. Hence, it is important to evaluate the additionality of multiple certification in bringing benefits to smallholders' farm economy. This study addresses this research gap using a sample of over 600 coffee farmers from two Fairtrade-certified cooperatives in Colombia's coffee belt to assess the additional economic impact of Starbucks C.A.F.E. Practices, Nespresso AAA, 4C, and the combination of Rainforest Alliance/Nespresso AAA certification. In examining coffee gross profit and household income, we find limited gains from the addition of industry and company-led standards to the Fairtrade certification. Evaluating pathways to improved economic performance, gross profit improvements appear most likely if higher average prices are combined with lower production costs. Finally, we show that the majority of farmers are unable to break even, irrespective of their certification status. This alarming result illustrates the need for further intervention in the coffee value chain.

TI  - Milk quality and hygiene: Knowledge, attitudes and practices of smallholder dairy farmers in central Kenya
T2  - FOOD CONTROL
AB  - Milk production is an important livelihood source for smallholder dairy farmers in low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs) such as Kenya. However, milk quality and safety are a challenge due to unhygienic handling and non-adherence to food safety standards. The objective of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and adoption of milk quality and food safety practices by smallholder farmers in Kenya.
   Ten Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), involving 71 smallholder farmers, were held to collect qualitative data on knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) of smallholder dairy farmers in Laikipia, Nakuru, and Nyandarua counties. Additionally, data were collected through a cross-sectional administered to 652 smallholder farming households. The results of the study revealed low knowledge level and negative attitudes towards respecting antibiotics treatment withdrawal periods, milk quality standards and food safety regulations. Farmers stated they had received low levels of training on milk quality and safety standards. The majority of farmers adopted animal health measures and hygienic measures such as hand washing and udder cleaning. However, unhygienic milking environments, the use of plastic containers, the use of untreated water, and lack of teat dipping compromised milk quality and safety. Currently, milk production, handling and consumption could expose actors along the dairy value chain to health risks. The adoption of milk quality and food safety practices was influenced by farmers' knowledge, socioeconomic characteristics, and choice of marketing channel.
   There is a need to improve farmers' knowledge and attitudes and implement hygienic control, disease control and antibiotic residue control practices in the milk production process to meet required milk quality and food safety standards. Awareness campaigns and training programmes for smallholder dairy farmers could foster behavioural change and lead to an improvement in milk quality in Kenya.

TI  - Impacts of interlocked contractual arrangements on dairy farmers' welfare in Zambia: a robust Bayesian instrumental variable analysis
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - While contract farming and interlocked contractual arrangements (ICAs) are generally perceived to resolve persistent market failures and improve smallholder farmers' welfare in developing countries, uncertainties remain as to whether these arrangements enhance welfare because of farmers' low marketed volumes and margins. To account for potential selection bias, non-Gaussian and missing data problems, a robust two-stage Bayesian instrumental variable approach is used to determine the impact of dairy farmers' participation in ICAs on household income and milk revenue. Data are from smallholder dairy farmers in Zambia. We find that male household heads, wealth, experience selling to milk collection centres (MCCs), livestock holding, milking parlour ownership, landholding, and access to marketing information positively affect farmers' probability to participate in ICAs. However, increased off-farm income and distance to MCCs limit their participation. While some socioeconomic variables have significant positive effects of affecting ICA participation on household welfare, we find no sufficient evidence of causal effects of ICAs on household incomes and milk revenue among dairy farmers. Thus, while ICAs enhance smallholder farmers' access to markets, they may not address high rural poverty rates in developing countries. We provide some insights by which performance of ICAs in the dairy sector may be improved.

TI  - Unpacking Climate Impacts and Vulnerabilities of Cotton Farmers in Pakistan: A Case Study of Two Semi-arid Districts
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of climate risks and vulnerability facing cotton farmers in semi-arid regions of Pakistan. Given the ever-increasing climate change impacts on cotton production in Pakistan, especially in semi-arid regions where water scarcity puts additional pressure on water sensitive agricultural livelihoods, we have conducted this study to identify climate risks facing cotton farmers in two semi-arid districts of Punjab province (average annual contribution to total cotton production is 80%), based on various climate indicators (such as temperature, rainfall and climate extremes.). A mix of qualitative and quantitative methods has been used to explore factors of vulnerability and comparative vulnerabilities. In the cotton production stage, we found that vulnerability to climate change decreases with increase in the size of the landholding, mainly because large farmers have more financial resources at their disposal to deal with adverse climate impacts, such as crop damages and losses. Adaptive capacity, on the other hand, is found to be one of the significant factors determining the overall vulnerability at the household level, as level of exposure and sensitivity do not differ across different sized households. In other words, indicators of adaptive capacity, such as access to financial resources, diversified livelihoods and access to weather information plays a major role in reducing vulnerability against climate change.

TI  - Quality Improvement in African Food Supply Chains: Determinants of Farmer Performance
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - The integration of smallholders in modern value chains in sub-Saharan Africa is an important pathway for improving income and farmer livelihoods. Connected to demographic shifts, rapid urbanization, and the emergence of a middle class, there is a demand for higher product quality. In order to access these modern markets, smallholders need to enhance the quality of their products. However, factors that determine smallholders' decision to invest in quality upgrading are not well understood. Using cross-sectional data from the Ethiopian barley sector, we analyse the factors that explain smallholders' decision to improve quality. We find that socioeconomic, institutional and market factors affect the decision to improve quality. Our study contributes to the understanding of the determinants of quality upgrading at the micro-level of the economics of quality production, and thus of rural development.

TI  - Does Off-Farm Wage Employment Make Women in Rural Senegal Happy?
T2  - FEMINIST ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of wage employment on women's well-being in the Senegalese horticultural export industry. It uses a subjective well-being approach, based on self-reported happiness, to capture income and non-income aspects of employment. The study uses original survey data from 2013 for the Saint-Louis region in Senegal and an instrumental variable approach, supported by information from focus group discussions. It finds that women's employment improves subjective well-being for the poorest women, but not for women whose household income is above the poverty threshold. Women's employment improves women's happiness through an income effect, as it leads to higher income levels and improved living standards, but the non-income effects reduce women's happiness. This negative effect is related to a higher workload and low job satisfaction due to unfulfilled expectations. The positive income effect outweighs these negative non-income effects for poor women but not for relatively wealthier women.

TI  - Crop prices, farm incomes, and food security during the COVID-19 pandemic in India: Phone-based producer survey evidence from Haryana State
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - In March 2020, India declared a nationwide lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such restrictions on mobility interrupted the normal functioning of agricultural value chains. For a sample of 1767 tomato and wheat producers in the state of Haryana, we study to what extent the lockdown limited access to inputs, labor, machinery, and markets to produce, harvest, and sell their crops. We quantify crop income reductions during the first months of the lockdown and analyze to what extent these are associated with borrowing and food insecurity. We find that wheat producers, for whom state-led procurement guaranteed market access at fixed prices, suffered minimal declines in income. For tomato producers-an already more vulnerable population-income fell by 50% relative to their expected income in a normal year, largely due to a steep fall of tomato prices as they shifted from wholesale markets to local retail markets, resulting in a sharp increase in local supply. Relative to wheat producers affected by the lockdown, reduced income for tomato producers was associated with an increase in borrowing and reduced food security. We conclude that targeting producers of crops that face substantial price risk and introducing policies that stabilize market prices are important in efforts to aid recovery and build resilience of smallholder farmers.

TI  - The role of the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) in the attainment of household food security in Kenya: A policy and organizational review
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - The Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) is a government organization mandated to conduct research into, among others, crop and livestock production and marketing. In 2009, it launched a new strategic plan for the period 2009-2014, together with its implementation framework. This strategic plan aims to position KARI as a facilitator of growth in the agricultural sector in order to enable an average growth rate of 7 % per year over the next 5 years, as stipulated in the Kenya Vision 2030 policy. This paper reviews KARI's new strategic plan within the context of recent policy reforms at national, regional and global levels. It specifically examines the strategy in the context of Vision 2030, the Kenya Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS), the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP), and the Millennium Development Goals. The paper then discusses KARI's newly adopted Agricultural Product Value Chain (APVC) approach, which is expected to position KARI strategically as a key player within the National Agricultural Research System (NARS). It also highlights progress in the implementation of the new strategic plan and APVC approach with specific emphasis on partnerships, markets and gender as key focus areas and the implications of these on food security in Kenya.

TI  - Co-created community contracts support biosecurity changes in a region where African swine fever is endemic-Part II: Implementation of biosecurity measures
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - Smallholder subsistence pig production is common in Uganda and African swine fever (ASF) is endemic in the country, with its spread driven by human activities along the smallholder value chain. Previous research in the study area has revealed that many stakeholders are aware of how ASF is spread, its prevention and control, and have a generally positive attitude towards biosecurity. Despite this, even basic biosecurity is largely lacking. Costs, as well as a lack of adaptation to the local context, culture and traditions have been identified as factors hindering biosecurity implementation. Community engagement and local ownership of disease problems are increasingly recognised as important for improving disease prevention and control. The objective of this study was to investigate the capacity of participatory action at community level with broad inclusion of stakeholders to improve biosecurity in the smallholder pig value chain. Specific attention was paid to participants' perceptions and experiences of implementing the biosecurity measures included in their co-created community contracts. The study was conducted in Northern Uganda in villages purposively selected on the basis of previous occurrences of ASF. In each village, farmers and traders were also purposively selected. At a first meeting, basic information about ASF was shared and participants presented with a list of biosecurity measures adapted for farmers and traders respectively. Participants discussed each measure in farmer and trader subgroups, decided on the mea-sures to implement for one year, and signed a community contract to this effect. The following year, interviews were again undertaken and implementation support given. Interview data were coded and thematically analysed. Each subgroup chose a minimum of three and a maximum of nine measures, with wide variations between villages in their selection of measures. At the follow-ups, none of the subgroups had fully implemented what had been agreed in their contract, but all had changed some of their biosecurity routines. Some frequently recom-mended biosecurity measures, such as not borrowing breeding boars, were not considered feasible. Relatively simple and cheap biosecurity measures were rejected for reasons of cost, highlighting the participants' general level of poverty and the relevance of poverty as a specific factor governing disease control results. The partic-ipatory methodology allowing for discussions, co-creation and the option to refuse measures seemed to facilitate the implementation of measures that had initially been thought to be controversial. The broad community approach was deemed to be positive for strengthening community identity, cooperation and implementation.

TI  - Nationally representative estimates of the cost of adequate diets, nutrient level drivers, and policy options for households in rural Malawi
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - A growing literature uses least-cost diets to evaluate how effectively a food system supports access to nutritious foods. We identify the cost of meeting nutrient requirements for whole households in rural Malawi from and the nutrient-level drivers thereof. From 2013 to 2017, we can identify a household least-cost diet only 60% of the time with an average cost of $2.32/person/day (2011 US$ PPP). We illustrate that larger households have more diverse nutrient needs and face a higher cost for 1000 calories of a sufficiently nutrient dense diet. Shadow price analysis shows riboflavin to be the costliest nutrient in the market. We use policy scenarios to understand what drives the infeasibility and high cost. Simulating the impact of selenium soil biofortification of maize results in a feasible diet 94% of the time at half the cost ($1.22/person/day on average) and eliminates the shadow price of copper. This is explained by insufficient selenium from sources low in copper such that under baseline conditions it is impossible to get enough selenium without too much copper. Even when feasible, to avoid copper, more higher cost foods enter the diet than would be otherwise needed to meet remaining nutrient requirements. Other value chain scenarios to increase the availability and lower the cost of nutrient-dense foods did not meaningfully change the diet cost results. Of direct relevance to Malawi, this study demonstrates more broadly how least-cost diet methods can be used to assess barriers to accessing an adequate diet and the potential impacts of policy options.

TI  - Factors influencing farmer intentions to scale up organic rice farming: preliminary findings from the context of agricultural production in Central Vietnam
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
AB  - The Vietnamese government encourages organic farming (OF) as a move toward safer and more eco-friendly agricultural practices. To achieve the goal of popularizing OF, besides encouraging the participation of newcomers, the government should also focus on farmers already involved because their production decisions are the most effective means for communication. By blending quantitative and qualitative approaches, this study investigated smallholder farmer intentions to scale up organic rice farming (ORF). Data were obtained through direct interviews with 325 farmers in the Phu Vang, Phong Dien and Huong Thuy Districts of Thua Thien Hue Province, Central Vietnam. The results revealed the ineffectiveness in demographic characteristics, including gender, age, education, number of laborers, OF experience, percentage of organic rice area, non-farm jobs and involvement in community-based organizations to predict farmer intentions to expand ORF. The findings highlighted the more significant influence of factors related to economic outcomes, farmer awareness of OF, and their confidence in the market outlook. We recommend policies and interventions associated with promoting the advantages of organic agriculture, intensifying technical training, linking production with the market following the value chain model, equipping the market with information, diversifying support and timely undertaking of issued policies.

TI  - Post-harvest groundnut aflatoxin management among smallholder farmers in Malawi
T2  - WORLD MYCOTOXIN JOURNAL
AB  - Aflatoxin contamination in groundnut production negatively affects health and trade outcomes. Aflatoxin contamination can occur at any stage along the groundnut value chain. However, the stage immediately after harvest has proven to be the most critical stage in aflatoxin management. This study presents knowledge, perceptions and practices in aflatoxin management during groundnut drying and storage among smallholder farmers in Malawi. Using probability proportionate to size random sampling techniques, the study sampled 150 smallholder farmers from three districts in the Central Region of Malawi namely Lilongwe, Mchinji and Kasungu. Descriptive analysis of results indicates that 90% of farmers harvest groundnuts at the right maturity. Results also showed that 59% farmers prefer drying groundnuts inverted in circular patches while 70% store groundnuts in polyethylene sacks on racks. Further, the study found that 97% of the farmers in the sample are aware of aflatoxin contamination but only 28% were able to identify the effects of aflatoxin contamination. These findings have implications in the design of postharvest intervention strategies on management and control of aflatoxin in groundnuts.

TI  - Trust, but what trust? Investigating the influence of trust dimensions on supply chain performance in smallholder agribusinesses in Uganda
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - PurposeEven though trust is known for improving supply chain performance (SCP), previous studies have overlooked the investigation of its dimensions. Limited studies exist on the variations of the influence of trust dimensions in agribusiness supply chain relationships. This study examined the influence of trust dimensions on SCP in a developing country's context.Design/methodology/approachA cross-sectional study design was used to collect from 204 farmers and 192 traders (396 respondents) using a multistage sampling approach. Structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the hypothesized relationships.FindingsPooled sample results show that integrity and competence were the trust dimensions with significant effects on SCP, whereas competence was significant across different supply chains and markets, integrity and benevolence were only significant along fresh chains and in the contract market.Research limitations/implicationsThe extent of application of this study's findings is limited to situations similar to those of tomato and soybeans value chains in developing countries.Originality/valueThe paper contributes to a better understanding of the influence of trust dimensions on SCP across supply chains in different market typologies in agribusiness relationships in a developing country's context.

TI  - A multi-dimensional adoption approach for improved sorghum varieties in eastern Kenya: a climate change adaptation perspective
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - In this era of changing climatic conditions, agricultural technology developers continue to promote suitable innovations to cushion and improve resilience of smallholder farmers against adverse effects and shocks. These improved varieties contribute towards attainment of household and national food security. This paper aims to understand what influences households' decision to adopt, speed of uptake and extent of use of improved sorghum varieties (ISVs). Data from 452 households were analysed using Double Hurdle and Duration models. Study revealed that consumption expenditure levels, income and tropical livestock unit are important determinants of three household's adoption decisions. Access to agricultural credit, distance to administration centres and adoption intensity depicts unexpected a priori. The findings also show that households are credit constrained and use own or neighbour's home saved seeds to expand the use of ISVs. Study concludes that the three facets of ISVs' adoption are influenced by different combination of determinants. Due to the vastness and rough terrain in Tharaka Nithi County, agricultural credit lenders should come up with effective low cost, sustainable and scalable outreach strategies. Policies targeting to derisk sorghum value chain with an aim of incentivizing financial institutions increase their lending appetite to cash-constrained smallholder farmers and agro-dealers should be implemented.

TI  - Communication networks used by smallholder livestock farmers during disease outbreaks: Case study in the Free State, South Africa
T2  - OPEN AGRICULTURE
AB  - Smallholder livestock farmers routinely use existing communication networks as their information sources. This study explored these information sources, the frequency of contacts, and perceived usefulness of livestock health-related information received from these sources. Respondents were randomly selected from two farming districts in the Free State province. Using a mix of descriptive and correlation analyses, it categorized respondents according to their total information scores (TISs) and explored the relationship between their scores and socioeconomic characteristics. Findings show that 65% of farmers scored a high reliance on fellow farmers and extension officials. Mass media sources such as radio and television scored low on perceived usefulness. The correlation coefficients for age (-0.228), farming experience (0.183), extension visits (0.002), and information contacts (0.214) were significant (p < 0.05). Level of education (0.256), herd size (0.067), and perceived usefulness of information contacts (0.252) were also significant (p < 0.01). Gender, household size, income, cooperative participation, and access to financial services were not correlated to the TISs of respondents. It was recommended that mass media sources in the area be supported by extension communication specialists to disseminate livestock health-related information.

TI  - Centering labor in the land grab debate
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - Placing labor at the center of the global 'land-grab' debate helps sharpen critical insights at two scales. At the scale of agricultural enterprises, a labor perspective highlights the jobs generated, and the rewards received, by people who work in and around large farms. This approach guides my critical reading of the report prepared by a World Bank team that argues for large-scale land acquisition as a way to reduce poverty. Using data from within the report itself, I show why poverty reduction is a very unlikely result. I develop the argument further by drawing on research in colonial and contemporary Indonesia, where large-scale plantations and associated smallholder contract schemes have a long history. A labor perspective is also relevant at the national and transnational scale, where it highlights the predicament of people whose labor is not needed by the global capitalist system. In much of the global South, the anticipated transition from the farm to factory has not taken place and education offers no solution, as vast numbers of educated people are unemployed. Unless vast numbers of jobs are created, or a global basic income grant is devised to redistribute the wealth generated in highly productive but labor-displacing ventures, any program that robs rural people of their foothold on the land must be firmly rejected.

TI  - Linking agriculture and health in low- and middle-income countries: an interdisciplinary research agenda
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NUTRITION SOCIETY
CP  - Summer Meeting of the Nutrition-Society/70th Anniversary Conference on From Plough through Practice to Policy
AB  - Recent global fluctuations in food prices and continuing environmental degradation highlight the future challenge of feeding a growing world population. However, current dialogues rarely address the relationship between agricultural changes and health. This relationship is traditionally associated with the role of food in nutrition and with food safety, and while these are key interactions, we show in this paper that the relationship is far more complex and interesting. Besides the direct effects of agriculture on population nutrition, agriculture also influences health through its impact on household incomes, economies and the environment. These effects are felt particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where dramatic changes are affecting the agriculture-health relationship, in particular the growth of nutrition-related chronic disease and the associated double burden of under-and over-nutrition. Greater understanding of the negative effects of agriculture on health is also needed. While lengthening food value chains make the chain of influence between agricultural policy, food consumption, nutrition and health more complex, there remain opportunities to improve health by changing agricultural systems. The first challenge in doing this, we suggest, is to improve our capacity to measure the impact of agricultural interventions on health outcomes, and vice versa.

TI  - Private sustainability standards and child schooling in the African coffee sector
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Private sustainability standards are spreading rapidly in global value chains, especially in the coffee sector, and commonly aim at promoting environmental, economic and social sustainability. The social sustainability component is often overlooked in studies on the impact of private standards. In this paper, we investigate a particular social outcome and analyse how adoption of private sustainability standards affects the welfare of children in coffee-producing farm-households in Ethiopia and Uganda. We specifically analyse school enrolment and schooling efficiency of primary and secondary school-aged children. We find that participation in Fairtrade certification schemes increases the likelihood of children to be enrolled in secondary school and improves their schooling efficiency, although it is not associated with higher incomes nor with a reduced child labour time in the farm-household. We find that participation in Rainforest Alliance certification schemes has no effect on schooling outcomes of boys and slightly reduces the schooling of girls, while it does correlate with higher incomes and a reduced workload of children. Results suggest that effects on schooling emerge through social capital and awareness-raising about the importance of schooling among Fairtrade certified households, rather than from the mere prohibition of child labour and the enforcement of a child-labour-free production process.

TI  - Mapping the Future Market Potential of Timber from Small-Scale Tree Farmers: Perspectives from the Southern Highlands in Tanzania
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - In the rapidly growing Tanzanian economy, increasing demand for timber and limited wood supply from industrial plantations and natural forests have opened a new livelihood opportunity for smallholder farmers in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania, which is undergoing a tree-growing boom. In the absence of support services, research and statistics, the magnitude of the phenomena has remained unclear, along with the farmers' capability to meet market demands, access the markets, and negotiate prices. Primary qualitative data were collected to clarify the role of smallholder tree growers in the forest transition process and wood value chain using 60 semi-structured tree farmer interviews in four villages, and through interviews of timber buyers and processors. The findings indicate that the strong market demand has created dual markets, where higher quality industrial plantations mainly supply larger industries, whereas micro and small enterprises source wood from lower quality smallholder plantations. While the markets' quality criteria are expected to tighten, capacity building is needed to improve smallholder wood quality to ensure the long-run tree-growing livelihood and competitiveness of small-scale producers in the markets.

TI  - Tree Seed and Seedling Supply and Distribution System in Uganda
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - In Uganda, the tree seed sector is largely centralized, limiting access by farmers to high quality seedlings due to distant supply locations. This has left suppy of most of the tree germplasm to the informal sector, characterized by road-side tree nurseries and seed dealers who have limited knowledge on seed sourcing and collection and seedling production. Through semi-structured and key informant interviews, a sample survey involving 73 smallholder tree seed collectors, processors and tree nursery operators, this study investigates the role of government, smallholder tree seed collectors, processors and suppliers, nursery operators and the private sector in Uganda's tree seed and seedling production and supply system. The study also identifies constraints in the seed and seedlings distribution system in Uganda and suggests key policy and institutional reforms. The source of tree germplasm is found to be heavily influenced by ease of access. About 60%) of the germplasm is purchased by individual farmers for their own planting. Low quality seed, limited seed sources and overgrown seedlings remain key deficiencies in the tree seed sector. Potential business opportunities in the tree seed and seedling production and supply value chain are identified, including production and sale of high quality germplasm. These will enhance availability of tree germplasm of high quality to meet the growing need for afforestation and reforestation in Uganda.

TI  - Potential of NTFP Based Bioeconomy in Livelihood Security and Income Inequality Mitigation in Kashmir Himalayas
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The contribution of non timber forest products (NTFPs) has been acknowledged globally for their role in conservation, income generation, livelihood improvement and rural development. The potential of a NTFP-based bioeconomy has given a new dimension to the forest sector, and NTFPs are now considered favourably by the resource rich developing economies. The actual contribution of NTFPs has never been adequately estimated due to lack of sufficient baseline information on extraction, consumption patterns and traded quantities in Kashmir, India. Complicated management frameworks and fragmented value chains have eclipsed their diverse social life cycle in Kashmir. Therefore the present study investigates the bioeconomic transformation, livelihood contribution, income inequality mitigation and determinant socioeconomic factors of NTFP extraction in the Kashmir Himalayas. A multistage random sampling technique was employed to collect data through participatory household-based surveys from different villages. Data were collected through structured in-depth interviews, non-participant observation and focussed group discussions. Descriptive and analytical statistics were used for data analysis. The Lorenz curve and Gini index were used to evaluate the influence of household NTFP incomes on income inequality mitigation, and econometric models were developed to identify key factors that influence the level of household income from NTFPs to determine their potential for supporting livelihood security and bioeconomy in the region.

TI  - Fruit marketing, its efficiency and supply chain constraints in India: A case study
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB  - Study investigated the agribusiness opportunities, marketing channels and marketing efficiency of different supply chain systems for two important fruit crops kinnow and aonla (Indian gooseberry) in Rajasthan. Two districts, viz. Sriganganagar and Jaipur, having highest area under cultivation of these crops in the state, were purposively selected. Information was collected from 120 farmers, 30 wholesalers (traders/Contractors) and 30 retailers during the year 2009-2011 for both the crops. Further 25% of sample households were again revisited during 2019-20 to find changes in marketing of these selected fruit crops. The producers' share in consumer's rupee was 32% and 28% for kinnow and aonla, respectively. The marketing efficiency index in dominant channel was 0.48 in kinnow and 0.38 in aonla. The most common and important constraint in marketing of fruits was cartelisation among traders. The imperfect market structure forces the farmers to enter into a forward contract that sets a minimum price, rather at the dissatisfaction of the fanner, as an insurance against possible lower price at later stages. Establishment of multi-fruit processing units in production area, development of infrastructure at major market centres, and establishing export value chain for kinnow and necessary support/incentives for orchard management for timely disposal of kinnow fruits are suggested as strategies to improve the marketing efficiency.

TI  - New Paths to Capitalist Agricultural Production in Africa: Experiences of Ghanaian Pineapple Producer-Exporters
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE
AB  - With the global restructuring of agri-food markets since the 1980s, an impressive amount of scholarship has examined its impacts in African countries. However, little has been written on the emergence of local medium and large-scale commercial farmers selling to export companies or controlling their own export marketing arrangements. This article examines Ghanaian commercial farmers producing and exporting fresh pineapples to European markets. This group of pineapple producer-exporters represents a path to capitalist agricultural production that can be conceptualized as capitalism from outside: where capital flows into the countryside, rather than accumulation occurring from above or below within the agrarian economy. The emergence of this form of agrarian capitalism is stimulated by opportunities in new high-value agricultural export markets, but its stabilization depends on country-specific characteristics such as rural social structures, property rights and state support. The article documents the conditions of emergence of this new group of Ghanaian capitalist farmers, the period of destabilization caused by increasing international competition that resulted in a small number of large-scale agribusiness firms surviving, and the challenges that these agribusiness firms faced in stabilizing their capitalist agricultural production.

TI  - The use of modern information and communication technologies in smallholder agriculture: Examples from Kenya and Tanzania
T2  - INFORMATION DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Through examining the example of commercial small-scale horticultural farmers in Mt. Kenya region and Mwanza region, this empirical study aims to provide an explanation for why different perspectives on the impact of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the Global South exist. A mixed methods approach was used to show that ICT usage can lead to significant improvements, including access to simple and complex knowledge and the development of business linkages. However, the influence of ICT depends on the different ICT usage types and the capabilities of farmers to use them. This paper gives a differentiated view on factors influencing the effects of ICT on small-scale farming. It provides a typology of ICT that helps to explains some of the potential effects of ICT usage in the Global South. The results contribute to the current applied and conceptual debate on market access for smallholders and Information and Communication Technologies for Development.

TI  - Determinants of Market Participation among Smallholder Mango Producers in Assosa Zone of Benishangul Gumuz Region in Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FRUIT SCIENCE
AB  - Commercial transformation of smallholder agriculture entails production decisions based on market signals and significant participation in output markets. Consequently, this research attempts to contribute to the understanding of smallholder commercialization of mango production and analyzing factors determining the extent of smallholders' participation in output market. The study was based on the cross-sectional data collected from 150 sample households which were randomly selected from 6 rural kebeles. Both descriptive statistics and econometric analysis were used to identify and analyze factors that determine the extent of smallholders' participation in output market. Accordingly, out of the included 16 variables, 10 were found to significantly influence the quantity of mango sold. The Tobit truncated regression model results showed that the determinant of mango volume of sale includes resources ownership (land allocated for mango and land fragmentation), households assets ownership (number of productive mango trees and mango seedling availability), access to institutions (farmers club membership), social-network (critical support from non-relatives within the village and brokers), and economic (previous income from mango sale, Income from livestock sale, and mango market price) are the significant determinants of mango market participation. Given the current high market demand for Assosa mango, there is a room to enhance the level of mango commercialization, thereby enhancing mango market participation. To improve quantity of mango sold policies and development, endeavors must target at improving household resource endowment, creating market linkage and synergy among mango value-chain actors, and strengthening the existing mango nursery sites and infra-structure.

TI  - Promoting the role of farmer-based organizations for value chain integration: the tension between a program's targeting and an organization's investment strategy
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We use new data on 500 Farmer-Based Organizations (FBOs) in Ghana and regression analysis to reveal determinants of collective investments and the case of the Millennium Development Authority's (MiDA) agricultural program in Ghana to demonstrate that development programs offering hard incentives may be counterproductive in promoting collective action. We show that when a program sets criteria for participation and offers in-cash and in-kind support to selected FBOs, it may promote rent-seeking and crowd out equity capital formation. This is so because FBOs may have formed for the sole purpose of benefitting from incentives offered by the program and thus lack an economic justification, which is an important condition for progression through the cooperative life cycle. Further, by setting stringent participation criteria, the program may end up selecting younger organizations while it is the more consolidated organizations that are able to connect to business development services (BDS) and engage in more offensive collective action.

TI  - Does Organic Farming Provide a Viable Alternative for Smallholder Rice Farmers in India?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Smallholder rice farming is characterized by low returns and substantial environmental impact. Conversion to organic management and linking farmers to fair trade markets could offer an alternative. Engaging in certified cash-crop value chains could thereby provide an entry path to simultaneously reduce poverty and improve environmental sustainability. Based on comprehensive data from a representative sample of approximately 80 organic and 80 conventional farms in northern India, we compared yield and profitability of the main rotation crops over a period of five years. Contrary to the widespread belief that yields in organic farming are inevitably lower, our study shows that organic farmers achieved the same yields in cereals and pulses as conventional farmers, with considerably lower external inputs. Due to 45% lower production costs and higher sales prices, organic basmati cultivation was 105% more profitable than cultivating ordinary rice under conventional management. However, since holdings are small and the share of agricultural income of total household income is declining, conversion to organic basmati farming alone will not provide households a sufficiently attractive perspective into the future. We propose that future efforts to enhance the long-term viability of rice-based organic farming systems in this region focus on diversification involving higher value crops.

AB  - Contract farming, and the success of smallholders in rubber production in Cote d'Ivoire Some multinationals are currently investing in massive land purchases and, in so doing, they are threatening family farmers, at least to the extent that they are depriving them of land. Contract farming can be revisited as an alternative. We hypothesize a reduction in social conflicts and a process of technical and institutional innovation. We tested this hypothesis during a survey of 350 farms conducted in 2008 in the West Central Region of Cote d'Ivoire. The basic income of the small rubber farmers we surveyed came from cocoa, but half had adopted rubber. In Cote d'Ivoire, family rubber farms are part of a value chain in which plantation companies still play a key role in providing technical back-up and in purchasing the farmers' rubber. This structure, which resembles contract farming, brought rubber cultivation to the villages at a strategic moment in the decline of cocoa, helping the planters to reinvest, readjust their income, and subsequently to save, as payments for rubber were organized through banks. On the whole, the balance is thus positive for private and public companies and for family farmers. However, the question concerning the development of large plantations by high ranking civil servants and their pressure on land remains open.

TI  - Gendered repertoires of contention: women's resistance, authoritarian state formation, and land grabbing in Cambodia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FEMINIST JOURNAL OF POLITICS
AB  - This article was named the winner of the 2020 Enloe Award. The committee commented:This article embodies the spirit of the Enloe Award in providing a feminist understanding of the everyday experiences and strategies of poor women's social movements against the authoritarian regime in Cambodia. It traces the co-constitution of gendered formations of the state and women's collective action through an account of four distinct types of "gendered repertoires of contention" used by the women to protest Cambodia's land grab. The critical-reflexive understanding of social movements offered here illuminates strategies of feminist resistance to authoritarian state power in Cambodia and beyond. The article stood out for its clarity and evidence-based narrative, and we are delighted that it has won the award. As strongmen and autocrats become increasingly visible in global politics, what gendered resistances arise and how do these contend with repressive regimes? Since 2017, following a severe purge of his critics, Cambodia's longstanding Prime Minister Hun Sen has put the country under a near total form of authoritarian rule. His regime has been bolstered by a distinct mode of accumulation involving large-scale land transfers to foreign and domestic allies, which have systematically evicted and dispossessed a large number of the country's smallholder farmers and the urban poor of their homes and agricultural lands. Amid this surge of "land grabbing," Cambodian women from across the country have led and sustained public protests to reclaim their lands. In this article, I study the routines and performances of poor women's collective action against the state and outline four distinct types of "repertoires of contention" used by women in their protests: strategic positioning, anti-politics, self-sacrifice, and solidarity. I argue that these repertoires are embedded in and enact the authoritarian state that they contest and advance the notion of the "gendered authoritarian state" that is made visible in contentious interactions between the state and its dispossessed citizens.

TI  - Farmer perception and valuation of seed quality: Evidence from bean and cowpea seed auctions in Tanzania and Ghana
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Double blind field experiments and experimental auctions were conducted with bean and cowpea farmers in Tanzania and Ghana to gauge the relative demand for three types of seed products that differ in price and quality: certified, quality declared, and recycled. Whether the cost differential makes these seeds qualitatively different products as reflected in their perceived performance, and whether that translates into farmers' willingness to pay price premiums, are the research questions addressed by this study. Results indicate that, all else equal, there were significant differences in the perceived quality of the seed products evaluated. Farmers were willing to pay significantly more for their higher rated seed relative to their lower rated seeds. However, for a majority of farmers the magnitude of the premium they are willing to pay for a higher quality seed is less than the current price differential between certified seed and grain. Research and policy implications of these results for legume seed system are discussed.

TI  - Can improving animal health and biosecurity knowledge of para-veterinarians in Cambodia assist in addressing challenges in smallholder livestock farming?
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - Para-veterinarians are crucial in providing front-line veterinary care and advice to smallholder farmers in countries with under-resourced national veterinary services. Many of these individuals undergo basic training with minimal monitoring and evaluation of performance and knowledge levels. To identify the knowledge, attitudes and practices of Cambodian para-veterinarians a cross-sectional survey (n = 80) of Village Animal Health Workers (VAHWs) was conducted during August 2018 in the provinces of Tbong Khmum and Takeo in southern Cambodia. Descriptive statistics indicated that VAHWs had a high level (mean score 86%) of animal health and biosecurity knowledge. As the Royal Government of Cambodia continues to move towards commercial agricultural value chains, VAHWs are crucial to ensuring the safety and sustainability of these systems. Binomial logistic regression modelling found the length of employment (p = .003), reporting of pig diseases (p = .007), recommending the quarantine of newly purchased animals (p = .008), treatment of cases of haemorrhagic septicaemia with antibiotics (p = .032) and washing footwear with water when entering or leaving a farm (p = .008) were all positively associated with a higher (>= 92%) animal health and biosecurity knowledge score. These results demonstrate the correlation of positive biosecurity and disease reporting behaviours with high levels of knowledge, providing evidence that improved training of VAHWs can ensure they remain important in supporting the under-resourced national veterinary services. Regular monitoring and evaluation of training programmes for VAHWs will likely further strengthen the livestock sector in Cambodia.

TI  - Impact of Contract Farming on Farmers' Income in the Food Value Chain: A Theoretical Analysis and Empirical Study in Vietnam
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - This study empirically analyzes the influence of contract farming on income and farming difficulties in Vietnam by using the econometric models and theoretically identifying the affecting mechanism of contract farming on income, sustainability, and welfare by using the qualitative method. The empirical results show that contract farming insignificantly impacts farms' income while it can facilitate farming activities and decrease difficulties. The factors of education-head, gender of head, type of crop, and technology may affect farmers' income. The impacting mechanism of contract farming on income, sustainability, and welfare is theoretically proposed as follows: Contract farming initially impacts the intermediate factors such as cooperative, market access, knowledge and skill, product quality, technology, and support. These factors then affect capacity, linkage, quality, and certification which can enhance farmers' competitiveness. In the long term, stronger competitiveness, higher price, increasing productivity, and lower cost may significantly improve income, sustainability, and welfare. In general, contract farming may have positive impacts on income, sustainability, and welfare in the medium term and long term. In the short term, the result is not significant due to the similar or lower price comparing with the spot market price, growing production cost, decreasing productivity, and weak contract performance. The findings may help policymakers decide how to expand contract farming and its benefits. Economic scholars can test and compare both quantitative and qualitative findings in other contexts.

TI  - Local Engagement in the Agricultural Cooperatives (ACs) Operation in Cambodia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Agricultural Cooperatives (ACs) have empowered farmers to develop resources sustainably. They transfer traditional subsistence agriculture to diversify crops and develop a value chain. This paper aims to analyze local engagement by focusing on the degree of participation, factors influencing local engagement in ACs operations and the constraints of ACs operations to support communities. With a cohort of 421 farmer members in the Kampong Speu and Pursat provinces of Cambodia, household surveys were designed to consider how factors influence local engagement. It was discovered that: (i) local engagement in ACs operations is limited, and management of boards of directors is a critical constraint to motivating local involvement; (ii) local engagement in ACs operations is associated with access to water, benefits from ACs, participation in ACs activities, risk control and ACs management, and ACs operations do not promote access to agricultural inputs; and (iii) ACs operations have faced several constraints, including poor management, inadequate capital accumulation, unavailable loans, loan mismanagement, a lack of skills, high illiteracy levels, small share values, a lack of access to credit facilities, access to the competitive market and a lack of support from extension services. This empirical study, with implications from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), addresses a gap in the literature by exploring engagement in ACs operations.

TI  - Unlocking Market Potential of Agroforestry Products Among Smallholder Farmers in the Sahelian and Sudanian Ecozone Countries of West Africa
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - In the Sahelian countries, gathering of agroforestry tree products is one of the few livelihood activities that hold great potential for income generation and poverty reduction among resource-poor households. This study explores the determinants of market participation and selling decisions, which are key prerequisites for sustainable intensification and commercialization of the rural economy. A commercialized economy provides invaluable opportunities for smallholder farmers to increase their income and escape from poverty traps that are faced by most rural households in the Sahel. The results from a cross-sectional sample of 1080 households drawn from four Sahelian countries, namely Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso and Senegal, lend support to the relevance of three sets of variables in explaining agroforestry farmers' participation in markets and selling decisions. Market participation and selling decisions are affected by predisposing, facilitating and reinforcing factors. In areas where markets for tree products are functioning well, long distances from the main markets do not deter agroforestry farmers from participating in markets and selling decisions. This demonstrates that other interventions to strengthen value chains and market integration can be successful even where transportation is more costly.

TI  - "Now the Forest Is Over": Transforming the Commons and Remaking Gender in Cambodia's Uplands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Communal lands and natural resources in rural Cambodia have transformed over the past 30 years as the country attempts to transition from conflict to liberal democracy and integrates into global agricultural value chains. We find that gender relations are changing as a result of land privatization and the ensuing social and ecological crises of production and reproduction. The forest has become a space for the articulation of new masculinities modulated through class and racialised power, while women are increasingly relegated to the private space of the home and village, negotiating expectations that they perform care, farming and food provisioning work while juggling household debt. We ground our argument in a large sample of qualitative interviews conducted between 2016 and 2020 in the upland provinces of Kampong Thom, Kratie and Ratanakiri that provide narrative accounts of the transformation of common forest and grazing lands, logging livelihoods and food provisioning practices. Using a feminist political ecology perspective, we highlight the contradictory processes of enclosure of the commons, which operate simultaneously as sites of violence, resistance, adaptation and continuity.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF NEIGHBOR EXPERIENCE AND EXIT ON SMALL FARMER MARKET PARTICIPATION
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This research analyzes the motivations and dynamics of small farmer participation in supermarket supply chains in developing countries: why some small farmers join these new markets and continue their participation; why others drop out or decline the relationship from the outset. Drawing on insights from the technology-adoption literature on learning and experimentation, and also on findings from a simple two-period Bayesian model of farmer decisions to participate in a new market, we incorporate measures of neighboring farmers' experience into the decision model. Results suggest that farmers delay entry to observe their neighbors' outcomes; we find a negative relationship between the number of neighbor participants in a given period and a farmer's own decision to enter the supply chain. We find evidence that farmers delay entry for strategic reasons, allowing neighbors to bear the costs associated with a first wave of adjustment to the market, including higher product rejection rates and lower initial annual transactions with supermarkets, compared to revenues from marketing in the traditional way. Results are robust to definitions of neighbors using both administrative and geographic designations. Our results raise questions about the optimal sequence and level of farmers' market participation and exit, which remain largely unexplored in the literature.

TI  - "LIVING WITH POLLUTION" Juggling Environmental and Social Risk in Vietnam's Craft Villages
T2  - CRITICAL ASIAN STUDIES
AB  - Vietnam's rural provinces are home to thousands of craft villages; communities engaged in small- and medium-scale manufacturing of a range of goods, from recycled paper products to processed food. Since the liberalization of the Vietnamese economy in 1986, craft villages have played a significant role in poverty reduction and livelihood diversification for rural households, and currently employ nearly one-third of Vietnam's rural labor force. However, the rapid expansion of craft manufacturing, combined with a lack of planning, has brought increased air, soil, and water pollution to craft villages and surrounding areas. Pollution levels are now so serious that they pose a major risk to local health and agriculture. This article examines why producers continue to expose themselves to environmental pollution and its associated health risks. Drawing on four case studies of craft villages in the Red River Delta region of northern Vietnam, the authors find that risk is a multidimensional phenomenon. Craft production typically involves a value chain of closely connected family economic units and takes place against a backdrop of fierce competition for market share both within Vietnam and elsewhere in Asia. In this context, the current policy of managing the environmental risks of pollution through regulation requires producers to take risks in other domains of equal or greater importance to them; their livelihoods and social relations. Craft producers make explicit trade-offs between the risks of ill health and the security that family and community ties provide in the face of uncertain production space, markets, and livelihoods. These findings highlight the importance of thinking beyond regulation toward more holistic approaches to understanding and working with environmental risk.

TI  - Applying Ostrom's institutional analysis and development framework to soil and water conservation activities in north-western Ethiopia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Sustainable land management is of utmost importance in Ethiopia and relies on Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) measures collectively implemented by smallholders through participatory processes. This paper contributes systematic evidence on how SWC strategies are implemented and how participation is operationalized. Drawing upon inductive, qualitative research, we explore the design, implementation and evaluation of SWC activities, as they relate to Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, in order to determine how the activities can be made more appropriate, effective and sustainable. Findings show that on all levels of Ostrom's framework, there are shortcomings in the SWC institutions, which have to be addressed with more participatory approaches, a change from top-down to bottom-up measures, and economic incentives for farmers to invest in SWC measures instead of e.g. compulsory labor, and the integration of so far neglected groups like youth, women and the landless.

TI  - Does women's engagement in sunflower commercialization empower them? Experience from Singida region, Tanzania
T2  - GENDER TECHNOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Empowering women within sunflower value chains can create significant development opportunities for them and generate benefits for their families. This paper asks whether women's engagement in sunflower commercialization influences their levels of empowerment. The paper uses data from a 2018 study conducted by Agricultural Policy Research in Africa. A cross-sectional research design was used, and data were collected using mixed methods involving primary, qualitative, and quantitative methods as well as secondary data from the literature. A total of 600 farm household heads and 205 focus group participants (7-15) from 15 villages were selected for the study. Qualitative and quantitative data were subjected to content and econometric analysis respectively, with the help of Microsoft Excel and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences programs. The findings revealed that female household heads tend to benefit less than men from sunflower commercialization. Sunflower commercialization had a positive but insignificant influence on women's empowerment: the study found that low levels of access to and control over productive resources resulted in low agricultural productivity, which affects empowerment levels. However, household commercialization involving all crops did have a positive and significant impact on the empowerment of women because non-cash crops were more likely to be retained by women, even when commercialized. This calls for policies that support and promote a diversified portfolio of livelihood options for women farmers in Singida region.

TI  - Can climate information salvage livelihoods in arid and semiarid lands? An evaluation of access, use and impact in Namibia
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Climate forecasting is a crucial tool for managing risks in climate-sensitive economic sectors like agriculture. Although rainfed subsistence farming dominates livelihoods in Africa, information on access, integration in farm decisions and impact of improved seasonal climate forecasting remains scanty. This paper addresses this gap using representative data of 653 households across three regions in North-Central Namibia. The study employed propensity score matching, with a sensitivity analysis for hidden bias, to evaluate the impact of climate information on adaptive capacity and food security. Although half of the households received climate information, many rated it as insufficient for decision-making and relied on traditional knowledge. The main channels were the radio and farmer's peers, but trust was low. Farmers were found to attach high importance to climate information in relation to decisions about sale of livestock and stocking livestock feed, restocking, storing food for consumption smoothing and in making crop choices. Households receiving climate information had more diversified diets, higher food expenditure and engaged in more adaptive strategies, but on a small scale. Effective response to climate information for risk mitigation will require enhanced community awareness of available adaptive choices, development of market value chains, institutional support like extension services, and improvement of rural road and communication infrastructure. Working with local leaders and integrating climate information into local knowledge systems can enhance access and utilization in farm decisions.

TI  - Rural households in Papua New Guinea afford better diets with income from small businesses
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Papua New Guinea is an economic leader in the Pacific region via its extractive resources. However, these industries do not provide employment opportunities for the country's 6.4 million (80% of total population) rural inhabitants. Rural nonfarm enterprises (NFEs) could offer an additional source of structural change, whereby benefits are capitalized by domestic rural and urban households along the value chain. In 2018, we administered a survey to over 1000 households to gauge whether households with NFEs afford better diets. We examine the factors associated with NFE ownership using a multinomial logit (MNL) framework. We then evaluate whether welfare effects differ by the sex of the NFE owner using nearest neighbor matching to address selection into NFE ownership. Results suggest households with a NFE obtain greater levels of consumption on the order of 26% for protein per person, 11% for kilocalories per person, 13% for total yearly expenditures per person, and 10% for household dietary diversity. Results point to the resounding limitations of female-owned NFEs primarily created to cope with income risk. The findings highlight the relevance of NFEs as a poverty reduction strategy and the importance of targeting when promoting in-country entrepreneurship.

TI  - SUSTAINING THE GROWTH OF SMALL-SCALE FARMING: EVIDENCE FROM THE GROSS MARGINS OF SMALL-SCALE CASSAVA FARMERS IN UYO AGRICULTURAL ZONE, AKWA IBOM STATE, NIGERIA
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Cassava production in the Southern region of Nigeria is seen as one of the prominent cultural practices of the natives. The potentials of cassava derivatives and their value chains are enormous in reducing poverty and triggering economic development in the region. Premised on these assertions, the study was designed to analyze the gross margins of cassava farmers and determine factors that affect it in the southern region of Nigeria. In the study, 120 cassava farmers were randomly sampled using structured questionnaire. The descriptive analyses of the data collected revealed that women dominated cassava production in the region. The farmers were moderately educated with an average farming experience of 11.9 years, and average social capital accumulation, age, farm income, gross margin, and farm size of 6.0 years, 44.3 years, N68, 694.17, N29, 793. 57 and 0.59 hectares respectively. The empirical findings revealed that farmers' age, education, farming experience, social capital, cassava cutting, and farm size were significant positive determinants of cassava farmers' gross margins while household size, transaction cost and access to farm credit relate negatively. Based on the findings, it is recommended that youth should be encouraged in cassava production as a way to augment the aging cassava population in the region. Also, adult education should be encouraged among cassava farmers in addition to promoting moderate household size among others.

TI  - Malaysian biofuels industry experience: A socio-political analysis of the commercial environment
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - This study examines the Jatropha adoption process in Sarawak, Malaysia, a land rich in biological and ethnic diversity, but highly impoverished. Attempts to alleviate poverty through oil palm plantation development resulted in internationally condemned destruction of peat lands. Sarawak subsequently turned to the inedible, low-input, exportable, biodiesel feedstock Jatropha. This case study argues that Jatropha is unlikely to make more significant socio-economic contributions than oil palm or other cash crops. The analysis suggests that companies use social capital to aggressively expand their Jatropha business among the native population in order to gain access to native customary lands, which are often underproductive peat lands. Global biofuels sector development dynamics are examined through the lenses of political economics and social, agricultural, and energy studies. The research finds that farmers' decisions to participate in the biofuels global value chain may result in negative income effects, household food security reduction, and biodiversity loss from peat land destruction. The paper concludes with a proposal for an alternative approach to evaluate both social and financial drivers in order to prevent the negative effects of biofuel-based agribusiness on human and environmental systems.

TI  - Does the gender of farmers matter for improving small ruminant productivity? A Kenyan case study
T2  - SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH
AB  - A major constraint faced in implementing sheep and goat improvement programs in low input systems is the limited involvement of the pastoral livestock keepers. Gender dynamics represent strong determinants of pastoral livestock management practices but are however very rarely integrated in livestock improvement programs. This research adopts a gendered lens to explore sheep and goat breeding management, ownership and trait preferences. Using a qualitative approach ten gender disaggregated focus group discussions with 121 participants were conducted with beneficiaries from a USAID supported Accelerated Livestock Value Chain Development Project for livestock improvement in Kenya's low input systems. The results show that availability of sheep and goat breeding stock are directly influenced by gendered allocations of management activities. Despite women's contribution to sheep and goat management, men were perceived to exercise a greater variety of ownership rights compared to women, especially regarding decision-making over sheep and goat breeding. While sheep and goat trait preferences were similar for men and women the order of trait prioritisation was gendered according to divisions of labour and decision-making opportunities and constraints. The results demonstrate that gender dynamics in specific areas of sheep and goat husbandry in low input systems can influence breeding outcomes in different ways. Contributing to filling an important knowledge gap and supplementing existing literature, the study recommends the adoption of a gendered approach when introducing or strengthening productivity improvement practices. Strategies to ensure that sheep and goat improvement practices are not only relevant but compatible with the preferences of men and women are therefore considered more likely to improve technology adoption rates.

TI  - Women's empowerment and gender equality in South Asian agriculture: Measuring progress using the project-level Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-WEAI) in Bangladesh and India
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This introduction to a special section describes how a recently developed measure, the project-level Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (pro-WEAI) can be used to assess empowerment impacts of agricultural development interventions in India and Bangladesh as well as broader changes in rural labor markets. The special section comprises three papers. The first examines the impact of membership in self-help groups in five states in rural India on women's and men's empowerment and gender equality. The second presents experimental evidence from a pilot project in Bangladesh that provided trainings in agricultural extension, nutrition behavior change communication, and gender sensitization to husbands and wives together. The third investigates changes in women's roles within the jute value chain in the Southern Delta region of Bangladesh as household members migrate out of the study area and the availability of male labor declines. Although these papers focus on Bangladesh and India, pro-WEAI can be applied to impact assessments of agricultural development projects more generally. The three papers show both the usefulness of this new measure in detecting changes in empowerment indicators within the lifespan of a project and the value of having explicit empowerment objectives in agricultural development projects. The papers also demonstrate the value of having data on both men and women so that project designers can be more intentional about including both of them and monitoring outcomes for both to promote more gender equitable outcomes.(c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Corporate Power in the Bioeconomy Transition: The Policies and Politics of Conservative Ecological Modernization in Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The bioeconomy transition is a double-edged sword that may either address fossil fuel dependence sustainably or aggravate human pressures on the environment, depending on how it is pursued. Using the emblematic case of Brazil, this article analyzes how corporate agribusiness dominance limits the bioeconomy agenda, shapes innovation pathways, and ultimately threatens the sustainability of this transition. Drawing from scholarship on power in agri-food governance and sustainability transitions, an analytical framework is then applied to the Brazilian case. The analysis of current policies, recent institutional changes and the case-specific literature reveals that, despite a strategic framing of the bioeconomy transition as a panacea for job creation, biodiversity conservation and local development (particularly for the Amazon region), in practice major soy, sugarcane and meatpacking conglomerates dominate Brazil's bioeconomy agenda. In what can be described as conservative ecological modernization, there is some reflexivity regarding environmental issues but also an effort to maintain (unequal) social and political structures. Significant agribusiness dominance does not bode well for smallholder farmers, food diversity or natural ecosystems, as major drivers of deforestation and land-use change (e.g., soy plantations, cattle ranching) gain renewed economic and political stimulus as well as greater societal legitimacy under the bioeconomy umbrella.

TI  - Economic analysis of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) production in Northern Benin
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - IntroductionSesame is an important cash crop that can be grown with limited resources. In recent decades it has drawn interests of many researchers and developers. This study analyzed the economics of Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) produced in northern region of the Republic of Benin. MethodsStructured questionnaire was used to gather primary data from 120 farmers who made up the sample size and were chosen using a multistage sampling technique. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, profitability analytical tools, multiple regression analysis and Likert scale rating technique. Profitability analytical tools were used to assess the economic performance of the sesame production; a multiple regression model was used to analyze factors that determine the output of the production in the study area; a 5-point Likert scale rating technique was utilized to rank the production's challenges according to farmers' observations. ResultsThe findings revealed that sesame is mainly produced in sole cropping system and in rotation with other crops. The net farm income analysis showed that sesame farming was a profitable venture in the study area. The study also showed that factors like age, household size, crop rotation, and capital input influence the revenue of sesame production. While age, household size and capital input have a beneficial and significant influence on the farms' net revenue from sesame produce, crop rotation has a negative effect on it. Amongst the various constraints identified, the most significant ones are access to labor and land, uneven ripening, lack of storage facilities and access to improved seed. DiscussionBased on these results, authorities in agricultural sector should develop and promote this value chain at the national level as it will greatly boost the country's economy.

TI  - The role of poultry transfers in diet diversity: A cluster randomized intent to treat analysis
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Poultry has gained renewed attention as a promising value chain for women because it is an asset that is widely accessible to women, has low start-up costs, and provides a good source of nutritious animal-sourced foods for children in chicken meat and, especially, eggs. The current study presents evidence from an experimental intervention that randomly provided women either a poultry package transfer of vaccinated, improved-breed chickens and related inputs, or a cash grant of equivalent value within a sample of households participating in a social safety net program. These transfers were embedded in a set of intensive livelihood and enhanced nutrition interventions as part of a broader experiment in rural Ethiopia. We assess the impact of the poultry package transfer as well as the enhanced nutrition intervention on the consumption of eggs by both children and adult women. We find that the poultry transfer increased the frequency of egg consumption as well as the sale of eggs, falling between the extreme of an autarkic household and one in which production decisions are fully separable from consumption choices.

TI  - Factors Affecting Farmers' Participation in Contract Farming: The Case of Broiler Sector in Indonesia
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB  - Contract farming (CF) has been used extensively to integrate broiler value chain both in the developed and developing countries. Participation in CF is associated with the increased farm productivity and farmer income. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze factors affecting Indonesian broiler farmers' participation in CF. This study used the nationally-representative data of smallholder broiler farmers in Indonesia. The data were the results of the 2014 Indonesian Livestock Farm Household Survey (ILFHS) and consisted of 1,142 farmers distributed in 20 provinces. Logistic regression was used to analyze thirteen factors that potentially affected farmers' decision to participate in CF. Those factors were age, gender, education, household size, farming experience, farm area, broiler population, cooperative membership, cooperative service, farmer group membership, farmer group service, farmer association, and agricultural extension. The results showed that six factors had statistically significant effects on farmers' decision to participate in CF. Education, land size, population, farmer group, and agricultural extension have a positive influence on farmers decisions. Meanwhile, cooperative service has a negative effect. Farmer group and agricultural extension service have the strongest effect on participation in CF. The results suggest that farmer groups and extension services to small scale farmers are promising to improve their participation in CF.

TI  - Price analysis of the Indonesian carrageenan seaweed industry
T2  - AQUACULTURE
AB  - Indonesia is the world's largest producer of carrageenan seaweeds, an industry that supports the livelihoods of over 250,000 coastal households. Seaweed farming brings a range of positive benefits to household livelihoods, including cash income. However, the industry is subject to volatile price and production cycles to which seaweed farmers are vulnerable. Despite the central importance of seaweed farming to Indonesian coastal livelihoods, no formal analysis of prices has been undertaken. This paper addresses this gap by drawing on fortnightly price data for 13 locations in Indonesia over a 10-year period. It examines the social, economic and ecological drivers of price trends, seasonality, volatility and transmission. The paper offers four key findings. Firstly, that demand from international carrageenan processors drives long-term price trends. Secondly, that prices follow a consistent intra-year pattern across the country despite differing seasonal production patterns. Thirdly, that prices are not significantly related to product attributes such as moisture, sand and salt content, suggesting low price-grade differentials. Finally, that price levels are determined by key central aggregation and transport hubs and transmitted to remote areas. This indicates that there is substantial opportunity to upgrade the industry through improved coordination between value chain actors.

TI  - Groundwater arsenic in Bangladesh: what's new for policy research?
T2  - WATER POLICY
AB  - This paper provides an overview of policy responses to arsenic in groundwater in rural Bangladesh to assess their role and potential effectiveness in reducing exposure. With 97% of the country consuming groundwater for drinking, there is a continuing crisis of tens of millions of people exposed to elevated levels of arsenic. An examination of the number of people protected through two major remediation efforts suggests that recent progress may not be sufficient to keep up with the increasing population or to resolve the crisis during this century. Recent developments in remedial options are examined to identify their potential role in an evolving policy and research agenda. There appears to be growing agreement about future research and policy responses that can scale remedial options and make them widely accessible. These include: (1) the need for a reliable and affordable programme of arsenic testing and retesting; (2) attention to risks from other soluble contaminants and pathogens; (3) explicit priority setting across locations, time and to address fairness; and (4) development of value chains to ensure remedial options are supported over time.

TI  - Satisfaction across urban consumers of smallholder-produced teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) poles in South Benin
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The study used the expectancy-disconfirmation framework to investigate the satisfaction among urban consumers of teak pole in South Benin, so as to identify the areas where interventions are needed to secure market opportunity for smallholder forestry. A survey was conducted in five cities; and 223 household-heads were interviewed using systematic sampling, with a random start. Data were collected on socio-demographic characteristics, teak pole consumption forms, behaviour patterns, and motivations. Respondents also rated their expectations and perceptions for a set of nine attributes on a 7 points Likert scale. Hierarchical ascending cluster analysis was performed to identify consumer segments; and satisfaction level was analysed per segment, by determining the gap between expectations and perceptions, for all attributes. Four consumer segments were identified; and sociodemographic profiles differed across those segments. Competitive price was an important purchasing motivation across the identified segments. Consumers were dissatisfied with price, availability, knot frequency, bending, length, hardness, and durability of teak pole. The efforts to meet the consumer expectations should be concentrated on building farmers' capacity in silvicultural management, and ensuring the availability of good planting material. The issue of competitive price might be addressed, through the improvement of the overall efficiency in the value chain. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Global production networks, regional development trajectories and smallholder livelihoods in the Global South
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Recent advances in global production network theory, known as GPN 2.0, provide a theoretically sophisticated framework for understanding the articulation of global production systems with regional development trajectories. However, this framework was largely derived from lessons out of empirical analyses of the strategic coupling and value capture trajectories of firms in certain manufacturing and service sector 'hot spots', primarily in East and Southeast Asia, and its wider applicability for other contexts remains uncertain. This paper aims to address this lacuna by examining the potential for GPN 2.0 to understand regional development trajectories in agricultural production landscapes in the Global South dominated by smallholder-based farms that generate outputs for national and international markets. The distinctive characteristics of smallholders throw up significant challenges for the explanatory applicability of GPN 2.0 for rural development, at least as it has been developed so far. A key challenge is that smallholders cannot be considered equivalent to 'firms' as conceived in GPN 2.0. To overcome this problem, this paper argues for bringing a livelihoods perspective to bear on GPN 2.0. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach through reference to a case study of potato contract farming in Maharastra, India.

TI  - Between Replacement and Intensification: Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Different Land Use Types of Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture under Rapid Urban Growth in Nakuru, Kenya
T2  - PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER
AB  - Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) contributes to urban food security and provides important livelihood opportunities. Due to rapid urbanization, though, UPA is subject to increasing land use pressure. Existing studies indicate gradual replacement of UPA in favor of other land uses. This study controverts this unidirectional narrative to show that UPA simultaneously persists and intensifies. Using remote sensing and qualitative data in the case of the rapidly growing, medium-sized Kenyan city Nakuru, we analyze spatiotemporal dynamics of four agricultural land use types (large-scale open-field production, smallholder production, intensive small-scale open-field production, and large-scale greenhouse production) to better understand different sociospatial trajectories. The findings show the coexistence of complex patterns of replacement, fragmentation, and intensification. We thus examine the extent to which detected dynamics can be explained by the socioeconomic characteristics of the four UPA land use types. Whereas large-scale production is increasingly fragmented and replaced by both small-scale agricultural production as well as residentially or industrially built-up areas, more intensive land use types focusing on high-value cash crops proliferate and intensify production in the research area. The study clarifies the dynamics of ongoing UPA transformations and is relevant for urban planning policies in rapidly changing urban and peri-urban environments.

TI  - Niche Commodities and Rural Poverty Alleviation: Contextualizing the Contribution of Argan Oil to Rural Livelihoods in Morocco
T2  - ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS
AB  - Integration of many remote regions into the global economy has brought an increasing array of exotic products from rural areas in the developing world to the plates and cupboards of wealthy consumers. This article contributes to the growing literature that looks at the role of global consumers in social and environmental governance. We examine a set of global commodities that, due to their high value, retail at prices well beyond usual agricultural products, giving wealthy consumers great influence over livelihood and land use choices in producer regions. Proponents assert this kind of commercialization will alleviate rural poverty. We identify necessary conditions for this to happen in general and consider the specific case of argan oil, produced in Morocco and sold abroad for prices above US$400 per liter. Using a livelihood approach drawing on geography and related fields, we test the claim that niche commodity trade alleviates poverty in this specific setting. We find that argan oil commercialization has played a relatively minor role in household budgets and asset accumulation, whereas nonfarm work and remittances play a greater role. Our results show the importance of a livelihood approach in contextualizing commodity chains. We conclude that the poverty alleviation effects of niche commodity marketing are context dependent and influenced by agro-ecological conditions, resource scarcity, resource ownership regime, and characteristics of the value chains.

TI  - How entrepreneurial orientation drives farmers' innovation differential in Ugandan coffee multi-stakeholder platforms
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose This study explores the role of the key dimensions of farmers' entrepreneurial orientation - namely proactiveness, risk-taking, innovativeness and intentions - as drivers of product, process and market innovation in the context of one coffee MSP in Uganda. Design/methodology/approach Empirical data from 152 coffee farmers were analyzed via confirmatory factor analysis and partial least square multi-variate statistics. Findings Findings highlight, first, that farmers' proactiveness significantly drives their product innovation and, to a lesser extent, process innovation. This effect holds when considering key control variables, such as access to key resources and associated actors. Second, more surprisingly, farmers' innovativeness hampers market innovation. Third, entrepreneurial intentionsper sedid not play a significant role in farmers' innovation. Fourth, the adapted measurement of risk-taking from the Western literature did not suit well the Ugandan coffee farming context. Research limitations/implications These results lead to methodological implications for the measurement of farmers' risk-taking, innovative and proactive attitudes, as well as market innovation in rural Africa. Furthermore, they expand the role farmers' entrepreneurial orientation on product, process and market innovation in a rural African context. Originality/value Multi-stakeholder platforms (MSPs) are often claimed to play an important role in stimulating farmers' innovation and enhancing rural development. Nevertheless, little is known yet on if why some farmers participating in MSPs may innovate more than others. This paper addresses this gap by shedding light on the role of farmers' entrepreneurial orientation.

TI  - Barriers and Facilitators to Fruit and Vegetable Consumption Among Rural Indian Women of Reproductive Age
T2  - FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN
AB  - Background: Micronutrient deficiencies have been a serious public health problem among women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries including India, adversely affecting maternal and child health and human capital outcomes. Fruit and vegetables are important sources of micronutrients, and consumption of these foods is less than recommendations. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify perceived barriers and facilitators to fruit and vegetable consumption among women of reproductive age living in rural communities in the State of Maharashtra, India. Methods: Women aged 18 to 40 years were recruited from 8 villages surrounding the city of Wardha, Maharashtra, India. We used qualitative methods and held 9 focus group discussions and 12 one-to-one interviews. The data collection was stopped when no new information emerged. We used inductive thematic coding to analyze the data. Results: Women knew that fruit and vegetables were beneficial to health and expressed that they wanted to increase the intake of these foods for themselves and their children. Seven main themes were identified as being barriers or facilitators to fruit and vegetable consumption: (1) personal factors, (2) household dynamics, (3) social and cultural norms, (4) workload, (5) time pressures, (6) environmental factors, and (7) cost. Conclusions: Rural Indian women consumed fruit and vegetables infrequently and said they would like to consume more. Several potentially modifiable factors affecting the intake of fruit and vegetables were identified. Value chain analyses of fruit and vegetables in these communities will be important to identify opportunities to intervene and increase consumption.

TI  - Financing Large-Scale Mitigation by Smallholder Farmers: What Roles for Public Climate Finance?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - There is increasing interest in accessing climate finance to support low-emission, climate resilient agricultural development, but little is understood about how climate finance can be deployed to catalyze large-scale adoption of mitigation practices by smallholder farmers. This study assesses the potential roles of public climate finance in enabling smallholder farmers in Kenya's dairy sector to adopt low-emission farming practices. Drawing on multiple studies conducted as part of the design of a nationally appropriate mitigation action for the Kenyan dairy sector, it examines financing needs, institutional arrangements for channeling climate finance, and appropriate financial instruments. The study finds that financially profitable investments can be made by dairy farmers, but credit financing on commercial terms is not viable for dairy farmers lacking off-farm income sources. Dairy farmers make little use of formal financial institutions for several reasons, and while financial institutions have a strong interest in increasing their finance to the dairy sector, they face a variety of capacity constraints. Climate finance may have roles to play in strengthening linkages between dairy farmers and financial institutions, building capacities of different actors in the dairy and finance sectors, and enabling both farmers and financial institutions to manage risks. Concessional loans, credit guarantee funds and grants are all relevant financial instruments. If agriculture is to attract climate finance in support of large-scale mitigation action, a diversified, demand-responsive approach to financial innovation is required that engages different types of financial institution to support access to both savings and credit services tailored to the varied needs of men and women dairy farmers and the dairy value chain actors they work with.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 on Smallholder Aquaculture Farmers and Their Response Strategies: Empirical Evidence from Bangladesh
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Bangladesh's aquaculture sector has contributed progressively to the nation's economy over the years, but the COVID-19 pandemic has impeded fish farmers' access to markets, reduced their production and sales capacity, resulted in lower income, and increased food security vulnerability. This study assesses how COVID-19 affects smallholder fish farmers and their response strategies by employing data collected from 250 fish farmers and traders from intensive fish-growing areas of Bangladesh. The results reveal that most farmers experienced difficulty obtaining inputs, and the price of those inputs skyrocketed during the COVID-19 period, resulting in several months of decreased production and operations. As a result of COVID-19, farm gate prices for silver carp, ruhu, common carp, grass carp, and tilapia fish dropped by 25%, 23%, 23%, 22%, 23%, and 40%, respectively. On the other hand, fish feed prices were found to increase significantly. Reduced income from fish farming and other sources has triggered a significant drop in capital for farming operations and production capacity improvement, leading to food insecurity. The most common coping strategies include reduced buying from the market (vegetables, fruits, meat, milk, etc.), relying on less expensive or less preferred food, purchasing food on credit, and selling assets. Notably, due to COVID-19, a new mode of marketing has evolved as an adaptation strategy in the fish marketing system, such as the use of the mobile phone (18%) and Facebook/internet to sell fish directly to the customer (16%). The sector requires short-term financial assistance to assist fish actors with production and marketing challenges.

TI  - The determinants of grain storage technology adoption in Sierra Leone
T2  - CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB  - In Sierra Leone, there is renewed concern about post-harvest losses which account for 20-30% loss of farm produce. The lack of adequate storage facilities also affects produce quality, reducing produce market value with negative implications for various parts of the value chain (consumers, processors, etc.) requiring high quality raw materials. This study uses the Logistic Regression Model to determine the factors that influence the adoption of Grain Storage Technologies (GSTs) promoted by Sierra Leone Agricultural Research Institute (SLARI) in Sierra Leone. The study shows that education, household size and cultivated grain type are positively related to GST adoption, while farming and farmland acquisition modes are negatively related to their adoption. Interestingly, access to credit and extension services have little influence on the adoption of GST. Credits, like extension services, are haphazard and random with high interest rates and political connotations that farmers generally detest. As rural farmers are largely poor, GSTs are generally viewed as additional expenditures. It is appropriate that SLARI, government and other stakeholders refocus efforts on collective/community post-harvest storage systems such as farmer/community associations and co-operations. Facilitating efficient post-harvest storage systems in rural/farming communities benefits not only farmers in terms of increased income, but also hunger-stricken populations across Sub-Saharan Africa in terms of food security.

A face-to-face survey was applied to 1191 Costa Rican inhabitants. The results show that Costa Rican consumers are willing to pay price premiums around 30% for all the considered environmental certifications. In addition, a Cragg's hurdle model shows that household income, the level of education, and environmental or community activism increase the likelihood of consumers paying price premiums for environmental certifications, while men are less likely to pay than women. It was also found that the size of the price premiums that respondents are willing to pay are positively related to income, gender (female), and education, and negatively related to age. Once the effect of socioeconomic variables has been controlled for, we conclude that consumers are more willing to pay for the CN certification than for the other two. The results can be useful for participants in the coffee value chain; coffee producers can use environmental certifications both to enhance their participation in green markets, particularly in developing countries, and to improve their environmental performance.

TI  - Review of Macadamia Production in Malawi: Focusing on What, Where, How Much Is Produced and Major Constraints
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Macadamia is an essential commodity crop in Malawi. The nuts are a lucrative commodity and are used for household consumption, income generation among farming families and as a foreign exchange earning crop at country-level. Macadamia production in Malawi has increased significantly in recent years. Malawi is the seventh top producer of macadamia nuts valued at 23.5 pound million, with a global market share of 3%. In 2018, the country was the fourth-largest exporter of macadamia nuts that were valued at 18.2 pound million. The majority (90%) of this crop was grown by large commercial estates with smallholder's production only contributing about 10% of the total crop production. However, the smallholder sector is vital for the future growth of the macadamia sector in the country. Further, Malawian smallholders consider macadamia production as a low-input crop with large returns per unit area (10.7 pound kg(-1) ha(-1)), and it thus a lucrative commodity with high potential for poverty reduction and wealth creation among these farming families. This paper, therefore, explores: (i) the historical and current trends in macadamia nut production in Malawi; (ii) analyses the country's macadamia value chain focusing on smallholder farmer contributions; and (iii) discusses the constraints of smallholder macadamia production in Malawi for informed policymaking. We conclude that the synthesis of the Malawian macadamia sub-sector provides an understanding of the vital contributions of macadamia to Malawi's economic growth and improvement of livelihoods.

TI  - Factors influencing adoption of selected peanut protection and production technologies in Northern Luzon, Philippines
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - The peanut is the world's second most important legume, and peanut and peanut-based products have a large potential in the Philippines and other tropical developing countries both in terms of import substitution and export promotion. This study used survey data to describe the socioeconomic and technological level of peanut farmers in major peanut-producing areas in the country, and determine the adoption factors and constraints for selected technologies. A total of 296 farmers in 10 provinces were interviewed in 2015. The binary logic model was applied to explore the farm-level factors affecting the adoption of selected technologies (seed inoculant, seed treatment, chemical fertilizer and pesticides) for peanut farming. Results indicate that decision factors vary per technology but relatively consistent drivers to technology adoption are farmer gender, attendance to seminar or training in peanut production, availability of irrigation source, and membership in organization. Household size was an adoption constraint in select technologies. Technology uptake was also influenced by regional differences. Implications are increased provision of seminars and trainings for peanut farmers; facilitation of farmers' organizations; support by local government units (LGUs) in technology promotion, and ensuring adequate irrigation. Informing decision makers on the factors and constraints to adoption of these technologies will largely make for evidence-based policymaking. The adoption of the selected technologies covered in this study will not only improve farmers' yield and income, but may eventually contribute to lower production cost per unit and lower prices in the long run, which has implications to the whole value-chain of peanut and peanut-based products.

TI  - Connecting smallholder farmers to local markets: Drivers of collective action, land tenure and food security in East Chad
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The paper deals with the drivers influencing smallholder farmers' access to local markets in developing countries, assuming that collective actions along with food security and land tenure are related and interconnected aspects that could facilitate market access.
   Data were collected in 26 Chadian villages in the Sila region; 98 questionnaires were submitted to peanut and sesame farmers belonging to associations. An ordered logistic regression was adopted to estimate our model where the dependent variable, access to market, is operationalized in terms of perceived improvement to market access.
   Our research contributes to the present understanding of the determinants of market access and its links with collective actions, land and food security through a comprehensive view of association support activities, structural features and household assets.
   Our main findings highlight that the role of secure land tenure is crucial in order to achieve a better access to local markets, confirming that strong relationships within local value chain stakeholders have positive effects on the capability to sell products, whereas the role of food security is circular: the more food secure a fanner is, the more he or she has access to markets but on the other side access to markets guarantees a higher food security.

TI  - Rural Consumer Preferences for Inland Fish and Their Substitutes in the Dry-Zone of Sri Lanka and Implications for Aquaculture Development
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Poor understanding of market demand is a key factor in the recurrent failure of many production-orientated aquaculture interventions. In the Dry-Zone of Sri Lanka stocking-based fisheries enhancements in small-scale reservoirs have been promoted by the State since the 1980's with no evidence of sustainable adoption. Through an evaluation of positive (actual) and normative (aspirational) consumer preferences for inland fish and its substitutes, we aimed to assess underlying reasons for this recurrent failure and future prospects for the policy and rural food-security. Work commenced with a detailed scoping-analysis to establish socio-economic context and a sample frame for systematic surveys. Consumption recall and preference ranking/scoring techniques were applied in two iterative survey phases across 6 villages of Northwest Province. Totals of 39 and 165 respondents were surveyed across the two phases with selection stratified on age, gender, caste and wealth criteria. Results underscored the importance of inland fish to rural food security. Fresh inland fish was consumed by 60% of all respondents at least once per fortnight and by 82% at least once per month with tilapias accounting for 75-85% of meals. Preference for inland fish compared over similarly priced substitutes is attributable to their freshness at point of sale above any other intrinsic product quality. Larger inland and marine fish were more popular than smaller sizes of the same varieties though poorer households consumed lower cost small fresh tilapia (<180 g) and dried marine fish at higher frequency. Common carp an exotic candidate for culture-based reservoir stocking enhancements, held an intermediate position. National policies on inland aquaculture development and rural food security are discussed and recommendations made in the light of these findings.

TI  - The impact of irrigation on small-scale African indigenous vegetable growers' market access in peri-urban Kenya
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB  - Small-scale private irrigation is widely advocated as a means of improving agricultural incomes in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using the case of smallholder producers of African Indigenous Vegetables (AIVs) in peri-urban Kenya, we study whether irrigation-driven productivity growth translates into improved market participation by smallholders. We therefore a) identify factors that drive smallholders to adopt irrigation in Kiambu and b) study how irrigation affects vegetable marketing. We combine a regression analysis and propensity score matching in order to advance existing knowledge on the linkages of irrigation and marketing. We use a 2014 survey of 176 AN producers in Kiambu County and 156 AIV traders in Nairobi County. We find that irrigation corresponds with up to 99% market participation rate and 86% of output sales. We find that irrigators participate more in urban markets, compete effectively with market intermediaries, have more price bargaining power, sell less at farm gate and face shorter value chains. Surprisingly supermarket outlets were associated with non-irrigators, while irrigators opt for wet markets. Although irrigators have larger commercialization indices, the effect of irrigation depends on the type of technology used. We find that irrigation and the associated access to better marketing arrangements is skewed towards farmers with off-farm income and male headed households. Targeted support for female-headed agricultural households to access modem irrigation technology is therefore an important policy measure we propose.

TI  - Coordinating cereal farmers and buyers: evidence from Mali
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how various transaction-cost characteristics influence the choice of vertical coordination (VC) structures (e.g. different contract types) and horizontal coordination (HC) structures (e.g. different farmer organization types) to link smallholder farmers efficiently with buyers. It analyzes the relationship between vertical and horizontal structures, and the economic sustainability of different structure combinations.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper develops a conceptual framework to predict coordination structures as a function of transaction-cost characteristics, compares predictions for the Malian cereals market to empirical evidence using 15 case studies, and then analyzes structure combinations.
   Findings Asymmetric scale between farmers and buyers; uncertainty in production, prices, policy, and contract enforcement; and quality and quantity debasement lead to selections of structures with high levels of control. Vertical and horizontal structures demonstrate a complementary relationship in certain core coordination roles, while exhibiting substitutability in the provision of other coordination activities. The marketing cooperative and marketing contract pairing is the most prevalent combination.
   Research limitations/implications The conceptual framework is useful for explaining the selection of coordination structures, and can be applied in other contexts to strengthen external validity.
   Originality/value The framework facilitates predictions and explanation of both VC and HC structures, with empirical application on a country and value chains receiving little attention in the literature.

TI  - 'It's up to the market to decide': Revealing and concealing power in the sustainable tea supply chain
T2  - CRITIQUE OF ANTHROPOLOGY
AB  - In 2007, Unilever, the world's largest tea company, announced plans to source its entire tea supply sustainably, beginning with the certification of its tea producers in East Africa to Rainforest Alliance standards. As a major buyer of Kenyan tea, Unilever's decision pushed tea producers across Kenya to subscribe to Rainforest Alliance's sustainable agriculture standard in order to maintain access to the global tea market; according to a 2018 report, over 85% of Kenya's tea producers were Rainforest Alliance certified. Drawing on ethnographic material among supply chain actors across different sites along the sustainable tea value chain (from those designing and disseminating standards to tea traders to smallholder tea farmers), this article examines how these actors frequently attributed the power to determine the outcomes of certification to a faceless 'market'. Deferring to 'the market', we observe, served primarily to mask the outsized power of lead firms (in particular Unilever) to determine conditions of tea production and trade. At the same time, 'the market' was also in some cases qualified by our interlocutors, allowing them implicitly (and at times explicitly) to reveal power and give it a face. Concealing and revealing power in this way, we suggest, can be seen as a mode of engagement among supply chain actors operating in 'sustainable' supply chains, like the Rainforest Alliance-certified Kenyan tea supply chain, in which the power of lead firms tends to be consolidated through market-driven sustainability initiatives. Such a mode of engagement mitigates exclusion from sustainable supply chains while maintaining space for critique.

TI  - Economic Impact and Challenges of Jatropha curcas L. Projects in North-Western Province, Zambia: A Case of Solwezi District
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Forest products, wood and non-wood, remain vital among smallholder households in Zambia with charcoal being the most sought after product. This has led to increased exploitation of forest trees to meet the needs for fuel wood, among others. However, Jatropha curcas plant has been identified as a potential fuel source. In the early 2000s, profit-making organizations encouraged smallholder households to grow Jatropha for use as an alternative fuel source. This paper reports on a study conducted in Solwezi between 2011 and 2014 to evaluate the impact of Jatropha cultivation for biofuel production. A sample of 100 small-scale farmers involved in Jatropha cultivation and key informants were interviewed to evaluate the impact of growing Jatropha at the small-scale level. Results show that farmers lost out on time; income from sale of edible non-wood forest products; and experienced reduction in maize (Zea mays) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) production, worsening household economic conditions. Farmers attributed this loss to unclear policy alignment on biofuel production by government. We therefore recommend that project implementation should involve interactions of all legislative bodies and any other concerned stakeholders. There is also a need to promote the value chain, from production to marketing, which focuses on minimizing detrimental effects on the livelihood of small-scale farmers.

TI  - When the State Brings Itself Back into GVC: The Case of the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge
T2  - GLOBAL POLICY
AB  - During the last decades the role of the state in governance of Global Value Chains (GVC) for sustainability has been largely ignored. This paper contributes to the re-centering the state in GVC analysis. We provide an analysis of the rise and fall of the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge (IPOP). IPOP is a commitment of some biggest palm oil companies towards zero-deforestation in Indonesia, but was dissolved after serious critique from the Government of Indonesia (GoI). Our question is: why and how did the GoI decide to put an end to the IPOP? We show that the GoI orchestrated the IPOP's demise by framing it as a danger to smallholder development, as not acknowledging public standards, and as an illegal cartel. The GoI's counter-framing re-asserts its sovereignty over producers, rule-making and economic organization. We argue that when a state perceives that when non-state-driven GVC governance threatens its sovereignty over producers, rule-making and economic organization, it will engage in discursive power struggle with non-state actors. More specifically, collective action of non-state actors can particularly trigger a state to engage in discursive power struggle with non-state actors.

TI  - Rice farmers' preferences for fairtrade contracting in Benin: Evidence from a discrete choice experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Private standards such as Fairtrade have emerged as a response to consumer, civil society and corporate concerns about the production conditions of imported food. Many studies have investigated the welfare implications of smallholder participation in Fairtrade schemes and consumers' willingness to pay for Fairtrade and other labelled products. On the other hand, no study has yet investigated farmers' preferences for Fairtrade and other private standards. Such insights would be valuable to improve the efficiency of certification schemes and ensure that they are tailored to farmers' needs. Using a choice experiment, this study investigates the preferences of smallholder rice farmers in Benin for Fairtrade and Organic standards and compares the value of three types of contracts (domestic, Fairtrade, and Fairtrade-Organic). The results indicate that farmers positively value contracts, but prefer domestic over Fairtrade contracts because the former involve fewer requirements. At current market prices, farmers are willing to accept a Fairtrade contract that includes fertiliser and child labour restrictions and a social premium, but they are not willing to accept a Fairtrade-Organic contract that completely prohibits chemical input use. The results imply that adding organic requirements to Fairtrade contracts may undermine the adoption and spread of Fairtrade certification in the Beninese rice sector. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Mediating Indebtedness in South Africa
T2  - ETHNOS
AB  - When South Africa's credit/debt landscape expanded during the 1990s, this was justified by some as a new form of inclusion but alleged by others to have intensified the power and profit of capitalism and acted to the detriment of householders, thus perpetuating 'credit apartheid'. Yet, blame cannot be so easily assigned. Forces of state and market have intertwined to create a redistributive neoliberalism, enabling brokers - who have played a key role in establishing the current credit/debt landscape - to insert themselves into the interstices of the system, making money by adding interest at every point in the value chain. Apartheid's spatial separations meant that traders - and later informal moneylenders - relied on agents to bridge the gap between themselves and the rural/township world of economic informality. Even attempts at credit reform have been complicated, and stalled, by the ongoing presence of intermediaries. The paper explores these dynamics, illustrating how difficult it is to separate bad from good protagonists or perpetrators from victims.

TI  - Inequality regimes in Indonesian dairy cooperatives: understanding institutional barriers to gender equality
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - Women are important actors in smallholder farmer milk production. Therefore, female input in the dairy cooperatives is essential to dairy development in emerging economies. Within dairy value chains, however, their contributions are often not formally acknowledged or rewarded. This article contributes to filling this gap by adopting a multileveled institutional perspective to explore the case of dairy development in the Pangalengan mixed-sex dairy cooperative on West Java, Indonesia. The objective is to add evidence from the dairy development practice in Indonesia to the current agenda for gender and development as well as identify pathways for future research on dairy development that will help it do better in practice. Central to the exploration is a discussion of formal and informal institutions as part of the dynamics of the inequality regimes in dairy cooperatives. Evidence from dairy development practices in the Pangalengan cooperative shows, among others, distinct differences between the participation of male and female target groups in dairy development extension, as well as farm size- and resource-related trends in masculinization' and 'feminization' of the smallholder farmer household. The conclusions contribute to debates on more resilient, thus sustainable working relations in food chains, women's empowerment, gender equality and social justice in agriculture as well as cooperative studies.

TI  - Improving dairy cows feeding practices in the dry season: a strategy to increase the income of smallholder dairy farmers in Burkina Faso
T2  - CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB  - West African dairy farmers are faced with constraints in feeding their cows during the dry season when rangelands are not rich enough in soft grass. This leads to a drop in the supply of local milk. To address this problem, farmers purchase expensive feedstuffs that they use sporadically. Some seem to cope by combining grazing, fodder and cattle feed. However, these strategies remain poorly known. This study aimed at characterizing dry season feeding practices of dairy cows in extensive farms in the South Sudanian zone of Burkina Faso in order to identify and promote innovative and economically viable feeding strategies. A household survey was conducted among 134 farmers supplying dairy processors in the cities of Banfora and Bobo-Dioulasso, in western Burkina Faso. The interviews aimed at characterizing the feeding practices of dairy cows during the dry season. The study presents a typology of dairy cows feeding systems, highlighting a technically and economically promising feeding system, however practiced only by few farmers. In this system, the dairy cows receive good quality fodder in sufficient quantity (3360 +/- 1424 kg dry matter/cow/year) and moderate quantities of feed concentrates (253 +/- 244 kg gross weight/cow/year) during the dry season, in addition to a reasonable duration of grazing (9 h/d). This practice maintains milk production and provides a steady income to the farmer. It appears therefore appropriate to support the co-design of feeding systems integrating forage crops, grazing and moderate use of concentrate feed. The improvement of dairy cow diet appears to be mainly motivated by the organization of the collection and the incentives offered to farmers. In order to amplify the dynamics of agro-ecological intensification of milk production, and in particular this type of dairy cows feeding system, upstream operators of the local dairy value chain could develop an economic model that creates more incentives for the farmers.

TI  - An Evolving Agricultural Extension Model for Lasting Impact: How Willing Are Tanzanian Farmers to Pay for Extension Services?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Community-based extension services (CES) are vital for improving farmers' livelihoods, but most of them face a challenge of sustainability after phasing out of the externally funded initiatives that they are part of. This study estimated farmer's willingness to pay (WTP) for four types of agricultural extension services (AES) in the cereals' value chains provided as a part of two United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Feed the Future initiatives in Tanzania. Data were collected from 595 smallholder cereal farmers using a primary survey in four districts of the Southern Highlands. We implemented a double-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation method. Average WTP figures ranged from 20,000 to 24,000 TZS (8-10 USD) depending on the type of AES. Several socioeconomic and agriculture-related variables influenced smallholders' WTP for the extension services. This research explored the feasibility of a farmer-led model as a pathway to delink extension services from public and donor funding to achieve sustainable rural development. Farmers place a monetary value on extension services indicating that policymakers and practitioners should make further efforts to enhance a community's ability to achieve self-reliance through investments in CES.

TI  - Formal rules and its role in centralised-diffusion systems: A study of small-scale producers of oil palm in Colombia
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - This paper explores the different pathways of technology diffusion and the resulting impacts on technology adoption that can emerge following a strategy to incorporate vulnerable communities of small-scale producers into traditionally top-down governance agribusiness systems. Building on the Contract Farming Arrangements (CFA) literature, we suggest that despite high levels of top-down control and the mono systems of diffusion that these practices imply, diffusion forms can vary considerably according to the motivations that drive different types of producers and the variances in local governance. We summarise these diffusion forms as a diffusion pathway of governance dictated by dominant change agent control and a diffusion pathway of governance dictated by change agent control and user participation. An important contribution of the paper is to highlight the critical role of formal rules in defining the types of governance for the creation of these different pathways. However, additional factors associated with the participation of smallholders such as attachment to land, engagement in collective action and long-term sustainability visions also introduce variations in these pathways and define the results of technology adoption. The study focuses on the Colombian oil palm sector; a key agribusiness sector targeted by policy makers with a strategy to integrate small-scale farmers into the agribusiness value chain as a means to relieve poverty and reduce levels of rural violence associated with conflicts over land and production of elicit crops.

TI  - Smaller-scale land grabs and accumulation from below: Violence, coercion and consent in spatially uneven agrarian change in Shan State, Myanmar
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This article presents field research data on a smallholder maize crop boom in Shan State, northern Myanmar, and its spatially uneven dispossessory effects. Local research teams studied eight villages, four in the north and an equal number in the south of Shan State, using focus group discussions and randomized household interviews, supplemented with key informant interviews. This study deepens the global land grab debate by highlighting the role of smallholder cash crop booms in "smaller-scale" land grabs that have been shown to be significant drivers of agrarian transformation, especially in Southeast Asia. The article builds on the conceptualization of "accumulation from below" by accounting for the geographically differentiated processes of dispossession from smallholder contract farming arrangements, its variant forms of coercion and consent, and the political contingencies that give rise to and help explain uneven agrarian change. The study's findings demonstrate how political contingency shapes spatial patterns of accumulation and dispossession through regional and local variations in the politics of ethnic identity, migration, insurgency and an illicit drugs economy. These political dynamics inform the hierarchy of power and cultural familiarity between smallholders and local state-supported "silent strongmen", in this case town moneylenders and village elites, which-together with several other identified factors, especially the poppy economy-influence the spatial distribution of dispossession. Neither extraeconomic coercion within orbits of state power nor simply accumulation from below by market opportunities adequately explains uneven agrarian transformation. Instead, the analytical frame on forms of violence in capital accumulation should be expanded and deepened in order to better capture the complex coming together of violence, coercion and consent that is geographically specific, and taken together is more than the sum of their parts.

TI  - Governance challenges of cocoa partnership projects in Indonesia: seeking synergy in multi-stakeholder arrangements for sustainable agriculture
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This paper investigates multi-stakeholder arrangements initiated by businesses and NGOs from the North that aim to enhance a more sustainable agricultural production at specific localities in Southern countries. We aim to better understand the search for concerted action in multi-actor arrangements. Therefore, this paper presents a diagnostic framework with three strategic challenges the partnership projects are facing: linking global economic objectives to local needs, values and interests; bridging public and private interests and responsibilities; and seeking trade-offs between social, environmental and economic values. Starting from the partnerships' Theory of Change, this diagnostic framework is applied to comparative case studies of partnership projects in the cocoa sector in Indonesia, which are part of a Northern-based public-private partnership to improve farmers' prospective. It is concluded that the economic reality faced by the farmers differs from that of the Northern actors; collaboration with governments is difficult because of different organizational cultures; and the partnership projects underestimate the strength of vested social relations the smallholders are part of. Overall, the initiators of the partnerships seem to work with a too restricted economic interpretation of the local reality.

TI  - EFFECT OF MARKETING CHANNEL CHOICE ON THE PROFITABILITY OF CITRUS FARMERS: EVIDENCE FORM PUNJAB-PAKISTAN
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB  - Pakistan is the thirteenth largest producer and sixth largest exporter of citrus in the world. Citrus is also the most cultivated and exported among all other fruits in the country. The marketing of citrus in the country is totally in the hands of the private sector partially regulated by the government. Empirical assessment of the links between the participation in the marketing channels and farmers' profitability is characterized by conflicting results. The basic purpose of this paper was to measure the factors contributing to the profitability of citrus growers by taking participation in the marketing channels as the treatment variable. A cross-sectional data of 300 citrus growers were used for this purpose. Multinomial treatment effects model was used to empirically investigate the study objectives. By looking at the dynamics of farmers' profitability by controlling several production and household characteristics, findings of the study showed farmers' profitability was positively affected by the participation in the modern marketing channels, i.e., run by the processors and contractors. These results conveyed two important messages for the policymakers: farmers selling to the modern marketing channels were better off, and the traditional marketing channels (with intermediaries) did not hamper the profitability of the farmers.

TI  - Constraints affecting dairy goats milk production in Kenya
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - In Kenya, the population of dairy goats is about 200,000 and 80% of these are reared in Mount Kenya region. They provide a quick source of milk for consumption or sale, which has an immense value especially to poor households. The small land sizes required for their rearing are especially useful in these highly populated areas. Although much research has been done on problems faced by dairy cattle farmers, limited information is available on problems faced by dairy goat farmers. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the constraints affecting dairy goat production in Mount Kenya region. In a cross-sectional survey, 157 farmers were interviewed on major constraints using a semi-structured questionnaire. The results from the questionnaires showed that the main problems experienced by these farmers were as follows: lack of market of milk and goats 45% (71/157), diseases 33% (52/157), high cost of concentrates 25% (38/157), lack of feed 19% (30/157), problems of unreliable buck rotation program 16.5% (26/157), and insecurity 1.8% (3/157). The study revealed that dairy goat farmers in the region faced by a number of challenges and therefore, our recommendation is there is a need for farmers to be trained on innovative ways of value chain addition and other strategies to market their milk. Additionally, the government should put resources to salvage the milk plant and association members should put firm measures to improve management. Creation of farmer awareness, treatment, and disease control measures should be instituted to improve productivity.

TI  - Threshold investment and firm viability: Evidence from commercial poultry farms in Nigeria
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - Rapidly increasing demand for animal protein in many countries in the Global South has generated an expansion of the poultry subsector. This sector is typically diverse, ranging from small backyard farms to commercial farms of varying sizes. As the subsector expands, little is known about the performance or viability of different sizes of operation. Is there a minimum investment required to establish a viable commercial farm? Focusing on Nigeria, Africa's largest economy and most populous country, this study uses nonparametric statistics, transition matrices, and parametric estimations to identify the equilibrium poultry farm size. We find consistent evidence of multiple equilibria, particularly a high- and low-stable equilibrium separated by a threshold between small and large farms. Farms are highly likely to remain in the size category in which they begin; small poultry farms are unlikely to cross the threshold and transition to large ones. We also find that larger farms are better able to withstand a price shock than smaller farms, which are more likely to cease operations in the event of a shock. These underlying dynamics should be given due consideration by governments, donors and private sector as they enter the industry or encourage others to engage in it [EconLit citations: O12-Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development, L11-Production, Pricing, and Market Structure center dot Size Distribution of Firms, Q12-Micro Analysis of Farm Firms, Farm Households, and Farm Input Markets].

TI  - Rural market imperfections and the role of institutions in collective action to improve markets for the poor
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
AB  - Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa have liberalized markets to improve efficiency and enhance market linkages for smallholder farmers. The expected positive response by the private sector in areas with limited market infrastructure has however been very limited. The functioning of markets is constrained by high transaction costs and coordination problems along the production-to-consumption value chain. New kinds of institutional arrangements are needed to reduce these costs and fill the vacuum left when governments withdrew from markets in the era of structural adjustments. One of these institutional innovations has been the strengthening of producer organizations and formation of collective marketing groups as instruments to remedy pervasive market failures in rural economies. The analysis presented here with a case study from eastern Kenya has shown that marketing groups pay 20-25% higher prices than other buyers to farmers while participation was also positively correlated with adoption of improved dryland legume varieties, crops not targeted by the formal extension system. However the effectiveness of marketing groups is undermined by external shocks and structural constraints that limit the volume of trade and access to capital and information, and require investments in complementary institutions and coordination mechanisms to exploit scale economies. Successful groups have shown high levels of collective action in the form of increased participatory decision making, member contributions and initial start-up capital. Failure to pay on delivery, resulting from lack of capital credit, is a major constraint that stifles competitiveness of marketing groups relative to other buyers. These findings call for interventions that improve governance and participation; mechanisms for improving access to operating capital; and effective strategies for risk management and enhancing the business skills of farmer marketing groups.

TI  - As China Returns: Perceptions of Land Grabbing and Spatial Power Relations in Mozambique
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN AND AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - This article investigates how perceptions of China in Mozambican civil society are affected by entrepreneurial activity and bilateral cooperation between China and Mozambique - real, imagined, visible and legal as well as clandestine and illegal in the agricultural and forestry sectors. The research problem concerns how discourse on Chinese investors is formed in Mozambique. Two questions are posed. How does Mozambican civil society perceive their room to maneuver at a time of Chinese growing economic interest and 'return' to Africa? What views exist on the policy space for the national government? Using qualitative ethnographic interviews to answer these overarching questions about expanding/contracting maneuvering space, this article explains how Mozambique's largest social group - peasants - the National Association of Small Farmers (UNAC) and other societal actors perceive Chinese investors. Informed by theoretical debates on civil society, the article argues that coinciding with China's large-scale return to Africa, an already tense dynamic between civil society and the state is picking up speed. It is argued that this phenomenon is likely to have more to do with African governments accruing more power and policy space than through direct impact of Chinese economic activity on African social life. However, to avoid negative discourse formation, China and host governments need to become more open on and transparent about bilateral agreements.

TI  - Prefeasibility analysis of small-scale biorefineries: the annatto and acai case to improve the incomes of rural communities
T2  - BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY
AB  - The industrial applicability of exotic and wild fruits has been investigated as stand-alone processes framed to obtain a single main product. However, their combination and the valorization of the processing residues in a biorefinery scheme have not been explored. Therefore, this work aims to assess the technical and economic feasibility of small-scale biorefineries based on annatto and acai as raw materials. Therefore, the actual processing of both fruits was carried out experimentally. For annatto, the abrasion extraction of dye paste was performed, obtaining mass yields of up to 58.4% by working with ground seed. Regarding the acai, the pulp was obtained with a polyphenol content of 23.56 mg of gallic acid equivalent per gram of sample. The residues generated in both processes were used as substrates for biogas production, achieving biomethane yields between 186 and 533 mL gTVS(-1). These results were the basis for designing and simulating process scale-up in biorefinery contexts. Five scenarios were evaluated, involving the production of annatto dye paste, acai pulp, biogas from exhausted annatto seeds, slurry and seeds of acai, and feedstock integration. As the main energy result, it was found that the scenarios contemplating biogas production can supply thermal energy to more than 1400 households. From the economic perspective, it was found that economic feasibility is reached at flows below the national production in Colombia for all scenarios. This work demonstrated that small-scale biorefineries based on the processing of tropical forest fruits are an opportunity to improve the life quality of communities through the coupling of techno-economic results with social and governmental needs to strengthen the value chains of low-technified fruits in agribusiness.

TI  - Cashew Apples in Ghana: Stakeholders' Knowledge, Perception, and Utilization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE
AB  - Cashew (Anacardium occidentale), a crop projecting Ghana internationally beside cocoa, is usually cultivated for its nut, for both local and international markets. The cashew apple is underutilized in many African countries. This study is aimed at determining the knowledge, perception, and utilization of cashew apples in Ghana among stakeholders in the cashew value chain. Results from the study showed that the cashew industry consisted of farmers (89.1%), nut buyers (6.8%), extension officers (3.5%), and processors (0.6%) with uneven distribution of males (66.2%) and females (33.8%). Cashew apple utilization was low (<10%), though 84.37% had in-depth knowledge on the health benefits and value-added products made from the apples. Cashew apple is mainly utilized as fresh fruits or juice, with minor uses as an ingredient in food preparation, animal feed formulation, and production of mushroom, weedicide, ethanol, and manure. The cashew apple processors identified high cost of processing equipment, perishability of apples, lack of capital, market, technical know-how, and government support as challenges. Based on these findings, education of the stakeholders on value addition or processing of the apples at household and industrial levels and provision of stimulus packages to private processors are recommended to maximize cashew apple utilization in Ghana.

TI  - Assessing and managing intensification in smallholder dairy systems for food and nutrition security in Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - Smallholder farmers play an important part in the dairy value chain in Sub-Saharan Africa. Three technological approaches have been used to improve productivity. These are through, applying agricultural ecological processes (ecological intensification), utilising modern livestock breeding (genetic intensification), and socio-economic intensification. Ecological intensification includes continuous housing of cows applying a cut-and-carry feeding system, introduction of purpose-bred forages and pastures, and the introduction of agro-forestry within the dairy systems. Genetic intensification strategies include: importation of dairy breeds such as Holstein-Friesian (HF) and cross-breeding of the indigenous breeds with HF. Training and capacity-building activities to create sustainable livelihoods have been initiated for farming and technological practices of animal husbandry, but also to enhance appropriate leadership and corporative-building skills that would create and support an enabling environment for sustainability. These improvements and initiatives in the service delivery have been championed by national governments, development partner institutions, or non-governmental organisations through different programmes. Challenges of intensification include matching management to genetic potential of imported and cross-bred improved dairy breeds, ensuring low post-harvest losses, proper utilisation, and reducing environmental impact. Using examples from Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia, this paper reviews the management and assessment approaches used in fostering smallholder dairy development strategies and dairy's contribution to sustainable livelihoods in the face of intensification.

TI  - An Assessment of the Current Status of Postharvest Management of Major Agricultural Commodities in the Republic of Mozambique
T2  - AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA
AB  - This article presents a brief analysis of the current status of postharvest management of important agricultural commodities in the Republic of Mozambique, brings overall information to allow policy makers to make suitable strategic plans in order to boast postharvest management sector, so that the country will not fail to meet the target Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which is to secure food and end the poverty all over the world by 2030. Based on our analysis, we identify key issues related to postharvest management and losses for these commodities. We also discussed government programs introduced to support stakeholders engaged in postharvest management and marketing of food crops. We obtained relevant information from the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MASA) through postharvest management sector as well as Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIC).
   We analyzed the value chain for cash crops as well as exports, results indicates that, during the 1990-1991 years the cashew crop was valued at 15000 US Dollars, accounting for 2.8% of the total exports, 78.6% of household farmers are engaged in maize production, with less than 20% of the maize total production being sold. The general knowledge regarding postharvest management among stakeholders is inadequate contributing for losses ranging from 20% to 40% depending on crops and geographical location in the country. Moreover, Mozambique does not produce enough to feed its population, self-sufficiency in crop production cannot be achieved solely by increasing production, prevention or reduction of postharvest losses of cereal as well as cash crops are also necessary. This means that, the losses occur between the field and the consumer as a result of inadequate harvesting, threshing, drying, transport, storage and milling should be minimized.

TI  - ASSESSING COMPLIANCE OF CONSERVATION SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION STANDARDS AND PROFIT EFFICIENCY IN SMALL-SIZED FARMS IN KENYA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Sustainable Conservation Standards (SCS) promote the need for preserving soil life system and minimal use of farm chemicals including fertilizer to replenish the soil. The standards also guide farmers to meet international food safety and production standards such as Global Good Agricultural Practices (GLOBALGAP). The study was conducted in Kenya examined and compared levels of compliance to Sustainable Conservation Standards between GLOBALGAP certified and Non-GLOBALGAP Certified farms. Also, the study examined profit efficiency between GLOBALGAP certified and Non-GLOBALGAP Certified farms. The sample size comprised of 429 randomly selected smallholder farmers from three major snap bean producing regions in Kenya. The result revealed that the majority of GLOBALGAP certified farmers were likely to comply to Sustainable Conservation Standards techniques such as low usage of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizer than None GLOBALGAP certified farmers. The showed that compliance to SCS and food safety and production standards enables snap bean smallholder farmers to directly access advanced value chains and ultimately receive higher prices for produce. We conclude by noting that the cost of implementing international food safety and production standards is still expensive to smallholder farmers especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Extending the margins of marketization Frontier regions and the making of agro-export markets in northern Ghana
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - This paper demonstrates how the global commodity chain approach has mutated from a critical tool for studying the production of inequality in the global economy to an instrument of development policy that extends the frontiers of marketization to so-called "peripheries" in the Global South. Taking an outgrower scheme for the global production of organic mangoes in northern Ghana as point of departure, and situating this case study within the broader context of market experiments in the Ghanaian agricultural sector, it develops an account of global capitalism as a diverse, heterogeneous and messy arrangement of local borderlands. As a zone of inclusive exclusion these borderlands are brought into being by an economic discourse which separates the inside of the capitalist world from its supposed outside. The so-called integration of smallholders into global markets relies on exclusionary representations and the forging of new associations. First, economic practices in northern Ghana are portrayed by economists as defective and in doing so determine what lies outside the market. Second, within this "outside" - on which the "inside" actually depends - global capitalism mediated through the market models and rhetoric of international development organizations now literally touches the ground in specific geographical settings. Hence Frontier regions as represented by our case study bear the paradoxical character of the work of economics and are an instructive example for the performative power of economic theories. Marketization is revealed as a complex and socio-technically entangled process full of hidden prerequisites and unforeseen consequences that open up new social spaces of multiple ontological reconfigurations.

TI  - Assessing food losses and waste with a methodological framework: Insights from a case study
T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB  - Despite growing concerns about food losses and waste (FLW), research that focuses on FLW, especially along food supply chains (FSC), frequently uses unsatisfactory methodology and fails to provide clear results. The article reviews the existing methodological gaps with the aim of proposing a methodological framework for assessing and reporting FLW. The methodological framework was applied to a case study conducted on the "traditional" tomato supply chain in Cali (Colombia) from a waste management perspective. Interviews and surveys were carried out with farmers, traders" (wholesalers, middlemen) and corner stores. The quantitative levels of FLW are presented. Empirical results show that unsold tomatoes are frequently used for different purposes. The quantity or rate of FLW alone may not be sufficient to justify the research interest and guide policy intervention: data may conceal more important issues, such as questions of food safety and health risks or economic losses. From a methodological perspective, it would be interesting to test the applicability of the framework to other aspects of FLW (e.g. qualitative FLW) and to wider case studies (e.g. households).

TI  - Migration, labor and women's empowerment: Evidence from an agricultural value chain in Bangladesh
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - As a substantial portion of the rural labor force migrates to urban areas, it is commonly assumed that women could take over traditionally male tasks in agricultural production, with potentially empowering outcomes for women. We study how changes in the supply of labor may influence female labor partici-pation and empowerment outcomes. Using a detailed panel dataset on jute producers in the delta region of Bangladesh, we test whether out-migration of household members and perceived labor shortages are associated with the share of household and hired labor performed by women, and women's empower-ment. When a household experiences reduced household or hired labor supply, we observe a relatively larger use of female household labor, but a reduced share of female hired labor. We also find that reduced labor supply is not associated with significant reductions in gender wage gaps, or enhanced women's empowerment. These findings suggest that given existing gender norms, male and female labor are not perfect substitutes for one another, and as a result, male outmigration is not associated with improved outcomes for women in cash crop production in the short run. Our results demonstrate a need for better understanding of the role of gender in rural labor markets, particularly in contexts of rapid urbanization.

TI  - Upscaling Groundnut Seed Production and Delivery through Long-Term Public-Private and Development Organization Partnerships: Experiences from Tanzania
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Making quality seed of improved legume varieties sustainably available and accessible to farmers in a timely manner and at affordable price is a major challenge in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Overcoming this challenge requires collective and long-term action through public-private and development organization partnerships (PPDOPs). The PPDOP model was tested by key seed system actors under the Tropical Legumes (TL) and Accelerated Varietal Improvement and Seed Delivery of Legumes and Cereals in Africa (AVISA) projects from 2008 to 2021. The study used the case of groundnut in Tanzania to assess the role played by long-term PPDOPs in groundnut seed production and delivery systems. The effectiveness of seed production and delivery models of the various actors involved in the TL and AVISA projects was analyzed. The study used secondary data obtained from annual reports, unpublished and published literature, and institutional websites. The PPDOP model brought about significant changes to the seed systems. It was found that sustained seed production and delivery over a decade enhanced the performance of the groundnut value chain in Tanzania. Under the TL and AVISA projects, a total of 49,046 tons of groundnut from different seed classes were produced through PPDOPs, covering an estimated 613,078 hectares with improved groundnut varieties. The intervention reached 45,201 stakeholders through 3048 demonstration plots, 128 field days, 55 seed fairs, and 8147 tons of small seed packs of 1-5 kg. The study recommends the use of long-term PPDOPs in seed production and delivery systems for greater impacts on increased variety adoption and consistent seed supply and availability in SSA. Long-term PPDOPs ensure proper coordination, open communication, clear accountability, solid trust, and standardized practices among actors in seed production and delivery systems.

TI  - Growing cotton to produce food: Unravelling interactions between value chains in southern Mali
T2  - DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW
AB  - Motivation Most transaction cost economic frameworks, commonly used to examine and explain the co-ordination of agricultural transactions, use a linear approach for a single product transaction. This ignores the concurrence of multiple transactions by smallholder farmers in developing countries. Purpose This study aims to understand co-ordination among multiple product transactions by smallholder farmers and to identify ways to remove impediments to market participation. It develops an adapted transaction cost framework, considering contract types and forms of market participation as building blocks for co-ordination structures. The framework was applied to explain co-ordination structures between smallholders and buyers of cotton and cereals in southern Mali. Methods and approach To make the framework operational, we did the following: (1) selected transaction characteristics; (2) elaborated benchmarks to describe the intensity of transactions; (3) identified co-ordination structures; and (4) scored the intensity of transactions. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Findings The majority of farmers grew cotton and sold it to a parastatal company, the sole buyer, that also supported the provision of inputs. Inputs were used to grow not only cotton, but also cereals. Most farmers sold cereals on spot markets to collectors and traders. Using different structures allowed smallholders to obtain inputs and services, to pursue different income sources over the year, and to balance flexibility and security. Policy implications Collective organizations of smallholder farmers should be supported to improve their financial and managerial capacities to allow them to co-ordinate better with buyers and input suppliers. Institutional innovations to better balance risks for smallholders and buyers deserve consideration. These innovations include crop insurance, long-term credit, and warehouse receipts.

TI  - COVID-19 and women's nutrition security: panel data evidence from rural India
T2  - ECONOMIA POLITICA
AB  - In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, India implemented a stringent nationwide lockdown. Although food value chains and allied activities were exempted from the lockdown, there were widespread disruptions in food access and availability. Using two panel-datasets, we distinguish the pandemic's impact on non-staples versus staples in relation to household food availability and women's diet diversity at the national, state, and district levels in four economically backward districts of Uttar Pradesh (Maharajganj), Bihar (Munger), and Odisha (Kandhamal and Kalahandi). Both the primary and secondary data indicate a decline in household food expenditures and women's dietary diversity in May 2020 compared to May 2019, particularly for non-staples like meats, eggs, vegetables and fruits. This occurred despite special PDS, direct benefit transfer, and ration from aanganwadis rations reaching 80%, 50%, and 30% of surveyed households, respectively. While national and state-level expenditures recovered to the pre-lockdown levels by June 2020, the district-level expenditures did not recover. Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence of women's disproportionate vulnerability to economic shocks, the impact of a staple grain focused safety net program, and restricted markets on the access and availability of diverse nutritious foods. This paper makes a case for policy reforms towards PDS diversification to include nutrition-rich foods and market reforms to remove supply-side bottlenecks and expansion of direct benefit transfers for healthy food access. We also highlight the importance of gender-responsive safety nets and their increased coverage for improving intrahousehold nutritional disadvantages.

TI  - Does ownership of improved dairy cow breeds improve child nutrition? A pathway analysis for Uganda
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The promotion of livestock production is widely believed to support enhanced diet quality and child nutrition, but the empirical evidence for this causal linkage remains narrow and ambiguous. This study examines whether adoption of improved dairy cow breeds is linked to farm-level outcomes that translate into household-level benefits including improved child nutrition outcomes in Uganda. Using nationwide data from Uganda's National Panel Survey, propensity score matching is used to create an unbiased counterfactual, based on observed characteristics, to assess the net impacts of improved dairy cow adoption. All estimates were tested for robustness and sensitivity to variations in observable and unobservable confounders. Results based on the matched samples showed that households adopting improved dairy cows significantly increased milk yield-by over 200% on average. This resulted in higher milk sales and milk intakes, demonstrating the potential of this agricultural technology to both integrate households into modern value chains and increase households' access to animal source foods. Use of improved dairy cows increased household food expenditures by about 16%. Although undernutrition was widely prevalent in the study sample and in matched households, the adoption of improved dairy cows was associated with lower child stunting in adopter household. In scale terms, results also showed that holding larger farms tends to support adoption, but that this also stimulates the household's ability to achieve gains from adoption, which can translate into enhanced nutrition.

TI  - Contractual Farming Arrangements, Quality Control, Incentives, and Distribution Failure in Kenya's Smallholder Horticulture: A Multivariate Probit Analysis
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - With the rapid growth of horticultural value chains, the use of contractual farming arrangements, strategies of quality control (farm audits/crop rejections), pricing incentives, and distribution efficiencies (crop collection arrangements) are increasingly breaking market barriers, for example, private standards, certification, traceability, and supply reliability in developing countries. Cognizant of market access, farm produce value, sustainable production, and reduction of postharvest losses, this paper investigated whether farm size, schooling, producer price, farm visits, and social capital networks condition these strategies. The results show that use of written contracts is conditioned by farm sizes, more extension, and number of producer groups (PGs) while farm certification is positively predicted by farm sizes, more extension, number of sellers in the village and seasons with the same buyer. However, certification is less responsive to producer prices. Crop rejections are predicted to be less depending on a farmer's education, number of PGs, and the producer price but are more likely to increase the more the number of sellers. Further, the results show that a forward pricing incentive is highly correlated with higher producer prices, more extension, and number of seasons with the same buyer. Finally, uncollected produce at harvest is likely to decrease with farm sizes, more education and extension, higher producer price, number of PGs, and seasons with the same buyer but is more likely to increase the higher the number of sellers. Implications are made. [EconLit citations: L14; Q13].

TI  - Smallholder sheep farmers? perception of production constraints and competitiveness strategies in South Africa
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB  - Sheep production in South Africa has experienced some growth though very slow, and as such production cannot meet demand in the local market. This study aimed to determine the factor influencing the competitiveness of smallholder sheep farmers' and constraints faced by sheep farmers in South Africa. A farm-level cross-sectional data of 217 smallholder livestock farmers in South Africa were used to identify the factors influencing the competitiveness of smallholder sheep farmers in South Africa. The Porter's Diamond Model Framework was used to measure the competitiveness of sheep production in the study areas and principal component analysis was applied to assess the constraints faced by sheep farmers. The study results found that smallholder sheep farmers in the study area are faced with numerous production constraints, which inhibit their productivity and competitiveness. The most severe constraints include marketing, stock theft, lack of capital, diseases and parasite, and high feed cost. The study suggest that smallholder sheep farmers in the study areas can be competitive and experience growth through the creation of agribusiness enabling environments by promoting policies and strategies that will boost investments in sheep production across the value chain.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Adapting food systems to the twin challenges of phosphorus and climate vulnerability: the case of Sri Lanka
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Two of the biggest global challenges for food security - phosphorus scarcity and climate change - are threatening farmers' livelihoods, agricultural productivity and environmental integrity. In Sri Lanka, the agricultural sector is comprised largely of smallholder farmers where rain-fed rice is often a staple. Yet climate change projections indicate rice yields could drop by 40%, affecting the majority of farmers, and poverty levels could increase from 17% to 33%. At the same time, fertilisers are highly subsidized, without which farmers in this import-dependent island state would be exposed to future price fluctuations like the 800% phosphate price spike in 2008. Collaborative research between Sri Lankan and Australian researchers investigated the capacity of smallholder farmers, policy-makers and other food system stakeholders in Sri Lanka to adapt to these twin challenges via a participatory rapid integrated vulnerability assessment framework. We find that while Sri Lanka is vulnerable, there are many adaptive strategies already in place or planned. Although these strategies are not driven by climate change adaptation or phosphorus scarcity, they could be strengthened to support phosphorus and climate smart agriculture (PACSA). Sri Lanka's food production is in the midst of a major transformation, largely driven by the President's push for organic agriculture and organic fertilisers, waste-to-energy systems implemented through public-private partnerships, and the National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change. There are many 'win-win' PACSA opportunities both on- and off-farm, such as developing crop varieties that are drought-tolerant and need less phosphorus fertiliser and improved cold storage in the food value chain to reduce food losses.

TI  - Synergies and trade-offs of selected climate smart agriculture practices in Irish potato farming, Kenya
T2  - COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB  - Research on and disseminating Climate Smart Agricultural (CSA) practices has led to increased awareness and farmers' capacity to develop resilient agricultural production systems for sustainable livelihoods and food security while addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation. Thus, there is a potential in gaining valuable insight into how Irish potato smallholder farmers should respond to current and future climate risks. However, studies exploring and linking expert opinion on synergies and trade-offs in adapting the CSA practices are limited. This study integrated qualitative and quantitative data from 22 expert surveys and semistructured questionnaires to answer the following objectives: 1) Which top five CSA practices are currently used by Irish potato farmers and which ones are preferred by experts in response to climate change adaptation in Kenya? 2) How do the selected CSA practices perform in Irish potato farming in Kenya? 3) Which synergies and trade-offs occur upon implementation of these CSA practices? The study found that CSA practices most preferred by both experts and farmers are improved crop varieties, efficient use of agrochemicals, early land preparation, diversified crop production, efficient use of inorganic fertilizer, irrigation and changing planting dates. These selected CSA practices indicated the productivity pillar to be the best performing CSA pillar synergistically while trade-offs to occur across CSA pillars. These findings can inform different potato value chain stakeholders on the synergies and trade-off dynamics associated with adopting CSA practices for climate change adaptation. In conclusion, while CSA practices are perceived as essential, most preferred CSA practices are focused on increased production and adaptation, while mitigation goals receive less attention. The findings of this study provide an important basis for recommendation to farmers and policymakers. This study calls for sustainable and innovative ways that help to upscale the selected CSA practices in Irish potato farming in Kenya and beyond.

TI  - Beyond the Gender of the Livestock Holder: Learnings from Intersectional Analyses of PPR Vaccine Value Chains in Nepal, Senegal, and Uganda
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary The peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is one of the deadliest viral diseases of small ruminants and is endemic in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. While PPR vaccination programs exist in these contexts, many factors restrict their reach and effectiveness, which go beyond the often cited financial, technological, and logistical constraints. This paper examines these less investigated factors, in particular the role of gender norms and other social and cultural factors, in affecting which livestock keepers are unable to access PPR vaccines and which groups are less reached by the vaccine distribution systems. Across three countries selected for our study, we find that, overall, women derive fewer benefits from the system than men; in addition, belonging to certain ethnic groups, being of low caste, or living in remote regions are additional markers of exclusion and marginalization from accessing livestock vaccines. The peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a deadly viral disease of small ruminants, which are an important source of livelihood for hundreds of millions of poor smallholders throughout Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. PPR vaccination efforts often focus on overcoming financial, technological, and logistical constraints that limit their reach and effectiveness. This study posits that it is equally important to pay attention to the role of gender and other intersecting social and cultural factors in determining individual and groups' ability to access PPR vaccines or successfully operate within the vaccine distribution system. We compare three study contexts in Nepal, Senegal, and Uganda. Qualitative data were collected through a total of 99 focus group discussions with men and women livestock keepers and animal health workers, 83 individual interviews, and 74 key informant interviews. Our findings show that there are not only important gender differences, but also interrelated structures of inequalities, which create additional sites of exclusion. However, these intersections are not generalizable across contexts-except for the intersection of gender and geographic remoteness, which is salient across vaccine distribution systems in the three countries-and social markers such as caste, ethnicity, and livelihood are associated with vulnerability only in specific settings. In order to address the distinct needs of livestock keepers in given settings, we argue that an intersectional analysis combined with context-dependent vaccination approaches are critical to achieving higher vaccination rates and, ultimately, PPR disease eradication by 2030.

TI  - Difficult roads leading to beautiful destinations? Articulating land Reform's contribution to rural livelihoods in the Limpopo Province, South Africa
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
AB  - A key objective of the land reforms in South Africa was for the process to lead to the emergence of a cohort of black small-scale commercial farmers who would realize substantive agricultural production levels through irrigation and actively contribute to the local and national agricultural value chains. The available evidence suggests that this objective has been difficult to attain and the contribution of land reform to livelihoods of the beneficiaries has been negligible in the Limpopo province. This study deployed qualitative research methodologies to gather both secondary and empirical data that enabled analysis of the extent to which the land reform program has contributed to the livelihoods of small-scale emerging farmers in the surroundings of Bela-Bela Municipal Area, Limpopo Province. The study found out that financial resources are a big challenge, with most of the farmers being unable to raise the capital needed to invest in the farming enterprise. In addition, most of the 'emerging farmers' do not have the know-how and experience needed to run a commercial farm. Overall, the study enabled us to conclude that the land reform projects have not only had limited impact on the livelihoods of the majority of the beneficiaries, instead, the reforms have left the country-side facing a real risk of increasing food insecurity. This suggests that a wide-ranging programme of land reform is a necessary but not sufficient condition for meaningful transformation of the livelihoods of the households involved. More groundwork still needs to be done by government and other development agencies to ensure availability of proper post-land transfer support systems for the emerging farmers.

TI  - Knowledge systems and value chain integration: the case of linseed production in Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION & EXTENSION
AB  - Purpose: This study uses data from a sample of 150 oilseed farming households from Arsi Robe, Ethiopia, to assess the impact of different knowledge bases (education, training and experience) and their interactions on linseed productivity.
   Methodology: A multiple regression analysis was employed to assess the combined effect of the knowledge bases, factors such as age of the household head, land size, marketing channels and geophysical factors (such as land slope) on linseed productivity.
   Findings: The findings reveal no differences in productivity between trained and untrained farmers. They further show that training and the interaction between training and experience positively influence productivity. Our findings, however, reveal farmer education to have an inverse yet insignificant effect on productivity. Furthermore, we found that factors such as the slope of the land and the choice of marketing channel also play an important role in influencing productivity.
   Practical implications: Moving away from the traditional top-down approach could be the answer to avoid a mismatch between the information given by trainers and what the farmers actually need.
   Theoretical implications: The study used interaction variables of knowledge bases, and attempted to demonstrate the importance of a tacit knowledge base, which is often not well documented and therefore neglected in research.
   Originality/value: The research demonstrates the combined effects that interactions between several knowledge bases have on the productivity of linseed farmers.

TI  - Institutional environments and the livelihood impacts of voluntary sustainability standards: A Village-based analysis from southern Sumatra's coffee sector
T2  - SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Lead roasting firms are operating through Indonesia's coffee exporters to introduce voluntary sustainability standards (VSS) in an attempt to secure supply, and to simultaneously meet corporate social responsibility requirements, even as empirical studies continue to show uncertain benefits for producer livelihoods. Value chain interventions like VSS, however, are not rolled out over a blank canvas, and many contributing factors determine their overall impact on livelihoods, particularly the local institutional environment. This study assesses the extent to which variability of empirical outcomes is determined by the institutional environment, by identifying specific processes through which VSS interact with pre-existing social, political and economic institutions to influence livelihood outcomes. These include: firm-specific corporate strategies (including producer training); livelihood strategies of households (including access to assets); government programs; and local political economy, as manifest particularly through patronage between traders and suppliers. VSS have thereby become an additional institutional layer shaping livelihood strategies and regional development outcomes, best viewed as providing access to a new social network that may be exploited by producers. The interaction between VSS programs, livelihood strategies and pre-existing institutional environments in a particular place often dictates the variable outcomes for producers, making attribution of impact causation to VSS enrolment problematic.

TI  - Are middlemen facilitators or barriers to improve smallholders' welfare in rural economies? Empirical evidence from Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Middlemen play an important role by linking farmers to traders and final markets. This is particularly the case in developing countries, where market failure is ubiquitous and food chains still consist of many stages. This paper analyzes the factors affecting the farmers' decision to trade through middlemen and the impact of this choice on income and commercialization. We conceptualize middlemen both as an economic institution and as a social network structure. On the basis of data from 345 farmers in Ethiopia we found that several socioeconomic variables particularly age, education, farm size, wealth and location and social network variables notably ethnic and religious ties have an influence on farmers' choice of sales arrangement. Regarding income effects, gross profit was 225% higher for farmers without intermediation. This could be explained by the latter farmers having access to better quality inputs, better contract specifications and receiving higher prices for their products. Nonetheless, the majority of farmers continue trading via middlemen. We suggest three explanations for this outcome. First, wholesalers seem to prefer to work with middlemen to guarantee minimum quantity and quality, and to reduce the cost of measuring quality. Second, personalized relationships might lock-in smallholders into trading through middlemen regardless of income losses. Third, trading via middlemen can enhance smallholder commercialization by linking low resource endowed farmers to traders and final markets. However, direct trading with wholesalers seemed beneficial for relatively better-resource endowed farmers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Minor Millets as a Central Element for Sustainably Enhanced Incomes, Empowerment, and Nutrition in Rural India
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Minor millets comprise a group of cereal species that are genetically diverse and adapted to a range of marginal growing conditions where major cereals such as wheat, rice, and maize are relatively unsuccessful. Millets require few inputs and withstand severe biotic and abiotic stresses. They are also more nutritious than major cereals. Despite these advantages, neglect in several arenas has resulted in a steady decline in the cultivation of minor millets in India over the past few decades. As part of a United Nations global project on underutilized species, we undertook action research intended to stem the decline in cultivation and enhance the conservation and use of minor millets in 753 households spread across 34 villages in four states of India. Our aim was to improve incomes, nutritional status, and empowerment, especially for women. Overall, our holistic approach to mainstreaming species such as finger millet, little millet, foxtail millet, and barnyard millet indicates that these neglected and underutilized species can play a strategic role in improving many dimensions of livelihoods.

TI  - Alone or a combination: Ascertaining factors associated with choice of pig health management strategies amongst smallholder farmers in northern Uganda
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - Pig production is an important farm enterprise for an increasing number of smallholder farmers due to its potential for improving household incomes. The sector is however faced with high burden of health issues that limit most farmers from realizing the benefits. In order to improve management of pig health for smallholder farmers, an understanding of the major health issues and factors associated with farmers' choice of the pig health management strategies are paramount. Using a cross-sectional survey of 240 smallholder pig farmers in northern Uganda, this study assessed the factors associated with the use of different pig health management practices adopted by smallholder pig farmers. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics and two different regression models. Binary Probit Regression model was used to assess factors associated with the use of a single pig health management strategy, while, Generalized Poisson Regression model was used to assess the factors associated with the number of pig health management strategies used by the farmers. Results showed that the common health issues were African Swine Fever, lice, worms and mange, while the common strategies for health management involved self-administering antibiotics, consulting veterinarians, deworming, spraying with acaricides, selling the sick pigs, treatment with local herbs, and burying dead pigs. These pig health management strategies were influenced by farmers location, experience, age, access to extension, use of information and communication technologies, and use of processed feeds. This study recommends improving farmers' access to relevant infor-mation and expanding veterinary extension services by promoting the use of radio and mobile phones in pig health management.

TI  - Towards identifying enablers and inhibitors to on-farm entrepreneurship: evidence from smallholders in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Enabling on-farm entrepreneurship is an important step to enhance the contribution of smallholder agriculture to rural employment and poverty reduction in South Africa. Using attributes derived from positive psychological capital as proxies for entrepreneurship and data collected from 458 smallholders in and around irrigation schemes in KwaZulu-Natal, the study empirically examines factors affecting smallholder engagement in entrepreneurship activities. Findings show that access to extension and information from scheme committees, being a male farmer, having more earned income, membership to a cooperative and access to markets have a positive effect on farmers' entrepreneurial behaviour. Factors inhibiting entrepreneurship in the context of smallholder farming include land tenure insecurity, access to land without the necessary complementary resources, consumption credit and staying far away from irrigation schemes. The study recommends addressing gender bias regarding access to resources and information. Promoting interactive learning through networking will also result in positive entrepreneurial behaviour. There is also a need for the provision of demand-driven extension services, facilitation of market linkages and enhancing access to finance for would-be entrepreneurs. Access to credit should be directly linked to agricultural production through input vouchers and value chain financing. Addressing land tenure issues along with access to other complementary resources, inputs and services will also enhance on-farm entrepreneurship in the smallholder agriculture sector.

TI  - Smallholder farmers' knowledge and willingness to pay for insect-based feeds in Kenya
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Edible insects are increasingly being considered as sustainable alternatives to fish and soybean meals in animal feed because of their high nutritional quality and environmental benefits. However, successful introduction of a new product to the market depends on the target user's acceptance. Thus, evaluating the potential demand of insect-based feeds would provide relevant information for policy development. The present study assessed farmers' knowledge on edible insects as feed, their acceptance of integrating insect meals in animal feeds and willingness to pay (WTP) for insect-based feed (IBF) using a contingent valuation method. A household survey was conducted among 957 randomly selected farmers including: 409 poultry, 241 fish and 307 pig farmers in four counties in Kenya. Results of the study reveal that over 70 and 80% of poultry and fish farmers, respectively, are aware that insects can be used as a feed ingredient. In addition, over 60 and 75% of poultry and fish farmers, respectively, consider insects as a good component of feed. Poultry, pig and fish farmers interviewed accepted and showed willingness to pay for IBF. Regression analysis indicated that age, gender, education, marital status, distance to feed trader, awareness of insects as feed, attitude towards insects, acceptance of insect species, availability of agricultural inputs, use of commercial feeds, availability of training and market information had a significant influence on the WTP for IBF. Therefore, increased extension services to educate famers on the nutritional benefits of insect meals in animal feeds and existing market opportunities are expected to improve farmers' attitude towards utilization and consequently enhance WTP for IBF, which in return would significantly reduce the existing pressure on conventional fishmeal feed resources. Our findings provide the first insights into the market opportunities of including insect meals in the animal feed value chain in Kenya.

TI  - Forgone opportunities of large-scale agricultural investment: A comparison of three models of soya production in Central Mozambique
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Agriculture is one of the main engines for prosperity and economic growth in Africa but effective agricultural strategies to support rural development and poverty alleviation are not yet identified. While state investment in the small-scale farming sector is minimal, and the medium-scale "emergent" household farm sector remains underrepresented, large-scale land investments are advocated as means to bring capital to rural areas and stimulate development. Yet, little empirical research has been done to contrast agricultural development strategies and to understand their strengths and weaknesses. We present an analysis of different soya production models small-scale farmers, medium-scale mechanised emergent farmers, and large-scale commercial operations - and their socio-economic aspects in Central Mozambique. Based on purposefully collected data in 10 villages in Gurue district, our findings suggest that large-scale plantations create localized land scarcity and that the benefits from wage labour and local investments do not compensate rural populations for lost access to land. Small- and medium-scale soya farming also leads to decreasing land availability, but provides greater socioeconomic benefits such as on-farm employment and work opportunities along the local value chain. Small- and medium-scale soya production increases on- and off-farm income and leads to spill-over effects to the local economy. Negative effects of these models of soya production on food production could not be detected; instead the cultivation of soya significantly increases maize yields grown in rotation. These findings suggest that small- and medium-scale commercial farming can compete with large-scale operations in key socio-economic parameters and that a concentration on large-scale investments can result in forgone opportunities regarding rural development and poverty reduction.

TI  - Issues and Impacts of the Apricot Value Chain on the Upland Farmers in the Himalayan Range of Pakistan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The livelihood of the people in the Himalayan range of Pakistan is largely dependent on the cultivation of fruits. Apricot and apple are the major fruits of this region, which are marketed throughout the country and also exported to other countries. Due to high perishability and the poor farm-to-market infrastructure in the region, farmers are unable to get maximum returns. This study was conducted keeping in view the importance of the region and the impacts of fruits on the livelihood of the farmhands. Cross-sectional data from 200 respondents were collected through a multistage random sampling technique. Factor analysis was employed to find out the constraint in the apricot production and propensity score matching estimates were employed to see the impact of apricot production on the farming communities in the study area. The results of the factor analysis show the most important group of constraints in the growth of the apricot industry is awareness, which is an internal factor. This is followed by production, policy, and marketing constraints. The least important is processing technology. Furthermore, the results show that apricot production has a significant positive impact on decreasing the poverty level of the household, depicting a great potential for the development of resilient livelihoods.

TI  - Supermarket contracts and smallholder farmers: Implications for income and multidimensional poverty
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Food systems in developing countries are changing rapidly with a growing role of modern supermarkets. Supermarkets influence supply chains and the way agricultural products are sourced from farmers. Especially for the procurement of fresh fruits and vegetables, supermarkets often contract farmers directly to ensure consistent and high-quality supply. One important question, which is addressed here, is whether smallholder farmers benefit from supermarket contracts. Previous studies address this question, but mostly focus on income effects without exploring implications for other dimensions of household welfare, such as nutrition, health, or housing conditions. Moreover, most existing studies rely on cross-section data. We add to the literature by analyzing effects of supermarket contracts on income and multidimensional poverty using three rounds of panel data collected from smallholder vegetable farmers in Kenya and econometric models with household fixed effects. On average, supermarket contracts increase household income by over 40%. We also find significant reductions in income poverty and multidimensional poverty. Quantile regressions show that farmers in all income groups benefit, but richer households benefit more than poorer ones in absolute terms. However, supermarket contracts cause the strongest reductions in multidimensional deprivations among the poorest households.

TI  - The fragmented politics of sugarcane contract farming in Uganda
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE
AB  - In the last decade, contract farming has regained momentum among policymakers and global development agencies as a tool to promote inclusive rural development and responsible investments. Integrating smallholders within global, regional and national agricultural value chains, we are told, represents the sine qua non for alleviating rural poverty. In Uganda, under the label of out-grower schemes, contract farming is currently undergoing massive expansion, driven especially by the boom in sugarcane cultivation. Drawing from three case studies of sugarcane contract farming in Uganda, the paper re-politicizes the debate around contract farming by looking at the power relations within which these schemes are embedded. We argue, what is seen in Uganda's expansion is a political dynamic derived both from the major dislocations and dispossessions required to establish the plantation estate and its work force, as well as from the effort to bring many smallholders using unimproved methods on land with sometimes unclear tenure arrangements into contracted arrangements for supplying sugarcane. The result has been highly contentious politics around sugar's expansion, where struggles over land dispossession merge with those around exploitative wage labour, around the loss and transformation of livelihoods, and around debt, power inequalities and environmental harm, a matrix in which state violence and co-optation are ever-present.

TI  - On the profitability of irrigated fodder production: comparative evidence from smallholders in Koga irrigation scheme, Ethiopia
T2  - ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB  - Irrigated fodder production can be vitalised as a useful strategy to sustainably intensify subsistence livestock production owned and managed by smallholders and to diversify farm income through linkages to commercial livestock systems. However, uncertainty about the production and market environment of such a non-traditional commodity can be a major hindrance against commercialisation and scaling out of irrigated fodder production. This makes ex-ante analysis of profit portfolio and its determinants necessary in order to improve farmers' investment and risk management decisions. Using a stochastic approach to farm profit analysis to account for business uncertainty, this paper simulated and compared the level and distribution of profit that smallholders in Koga irrigation scheme (Ethiopia) can generate from irrigated Rhodes grass seed and from traditional irrigated crops. The finding shows the absolute and comparative profitability of irrigated Rhodes grass seed. Though 0.19 times less profitable than irrigated onion, irrigated Rhodes grass seed is 4 times, 1.27 times, and 1.25 times more profitable than irrigated barley, irrigated wheat, and irrigated tomato, respectively. Profit from the commodity is robust to adverse business conditions such as yield reduction, cost increase, and price reduction, assuring optimism about positive financial returns from investments to expand production. Long-term business viability can be improved and farm income further stabilised through interventions targeted at fodder agronomy to enhance crop yield and at value chain development to improve market linkages and output price.

TI  - Village Environment, Capital Endowment, and Farmers' Participation in E-Commerce Sales Behavior: A Demand Observable Bivariate Probit Model Approach
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - With the recent developments in widespread internet usage and digital technology, an ultimate worldwide transformation in information and communications technology has occurred. Especially, how people engage in the virtual market for buying and selling goods has changed dramatically, which flourished the playground of electronic commerce (EC). Interestingly, it has become crucial to create an ample opportunity for farmers to utilize a more comprehensive market range for selling their products. However, farmers participating in e-commerce sales platforms may be interrupted by various internal and external factors. Therefore, the study's primary goal is to evaluate the impacts of various external and internal factors on shaping farmers' behavior in participating in e-commerce sales platforms. The study utilized a demand observable bivariate Probit model to analyze the village environment and capital endowment effects to craft the findings. The study utilized micro-survey data from 686 households in the leading kiwifruit-producing area as the empirical setup. The findings illustrated that the village environment is the main factor that restricts farmers' e-commerce sales behavior, among which the infrastructure and policy environments have a significant contribution to farmers' e-commerce sales intention and behavior. However, the effect of capital endowment on farmers' e-commerce selling behavior has been found as significant. The village environment significantly affects both large- and small-scale farmers, and the capital endowment has a higher binding effect on small-scale farmers. Therefore, the paper suggests that improving the village environment for e-commerce development and laying the foundation for e-commerce development should be fostered. A differentiated incentive mechanism to improve the capital endowment of farmers should be constructed. A well-structured capital endowment triggering small farmers to capture the benefits of e-commerce sales should be imposed. The government should extend the support of the agricultural demonstration zone to facilitate practical training among the smallholder farmers. The formal and informal risk-sharing and financial institutions should prioritize building infrastructure to support farmers' short- and long-term investments. Farmers should realize the importance of e-commerce for integrating the agricultural value chain.

TI  - Interactions between households and industrial sectors in embodied carbon emission networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Household activities play an important role in driving industrial carbon emissions. In turn, the industry also affects household emissions via products and value chains. However, previous studies have treated households only as an exogenous driver of industrial carbon emissions; little attention has been paid to interdependencies between households and industrial sectors. Here, we developed a research framework combining semi-closed input-output analysis with network analysis to investigate these linkages. We applied our research framework in Chongqing, China, a city that underwent rapid urbanization from 2007 to 2012. We found that backward linkages (consumption-based accounting) between household and industrial sectors are much stronger than forward linkages (income-based accounting). Therefore, we further investigated mutualistic, controlling, and dependence relationships from the consumption side. The results revealed strong controlling and dependence relationships between households and resource-related, residence-related, and food-related sectors, and more mutualistic relationships between households and industrial sectors over time. In addition, the discrepant results for rural and urban households suggest that urbanization will significantly change the interactions between households and industrial sectors in controlling each other's carbon emissions. Our study helps to elucidate these complex interactions, and the results have implications for developing policies to address rising carbon emissions during urbanization. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Farmers, Traders, and Processors: Buyer Market Power and Double Marginalization in IndonesiaJEL codes
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Buyer market power can significantly reduce farm prices and incomes, making curtailment of such power a key strategy to improve rural livelihoods in emerging economies. A "double marginalization problem" occurs when market power is exercised at multiple stages in a supply chain. Although double marginalization has been studied extensively from a seller-power perspective, the corresponding problem on the buyer-power side has received scant attention. This paper addresses that lacuna through developing a vertical market model that allows buyer power to be exercised in local farmer-trader markets and also downstream at the trader-processor stage. We derive equilibrium results for output, prices, and economic welfare under alternative competition scenarios. The model is applied to the Indonesian rubber value chain by estimating the magnitude of buyer market power in farmer-trader and trader-processor interactions and quantifying the extent of welfare loss and redistribution of income among market participants due to double marginalization. Standard theory for seller double marginalization posits that it should be eliminated through vertical coordination within the supply chain. We conclude by discussing why such coordination may not occur within emerging-economy supply chains and considering policy innovations to facilitate better coordination.

TI  - Market organization and animal genetic resource management: a revealed preference analysis of sheep pricing
T2  - ANIMAL
AB  - Farm animal genetic resources are threatened worldwide. Participation in markets, while representing a crucial way out of poverty for many smallholders, affects genetic management choices with associated sustainability concerns. This paper proposes a contextualized study of the interactions between markets and animal genetic resources management, in the case of sheep markets in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. It focusses on the organization of marketing chains and the valuation of genetic characteristics by value chain actors. Marketing chain characterization was tackled through semi-structured interviews with 25 exporters and 15 butchers, both specialized in sheep. Moreover, revealed preference methods were applied to analyse the impact of animals' attributes on market pricing. Data were collected from 338 transactions during three different periods: Eid al-Adha, Christmas and New Year period, and a neutral period. The neutral period is understood as a period not close to any event likely to influence the demand for sheep. The results show that physical characteristics such as live weight, height at withers and coat colour have a strong influence on the animals' prices. Live weight has also had an increasing marginal impact on price. The different markets (local butcher, feasts, export market, sacrifices) represent distinct demands for genetic characteristics, entailing interesting consequences for animal genetic resource management. Any breeding programme should therefore take this diversity into account to allow this sector to contribute better to a sustainable development of the country.

TI  - Working towards consensus: the need for coordinated policies to assist control of foot and mouth disease and emerging disease threats in South-East Asia
T2  - REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
AB  - Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is an important transboundary disease in South-East Asia. Its control has been a priority in the region for at least 20 years, with extensive institutional support and capacity-building being provided by the international community through the World Organisation for Animal Health. This paper describes the FMD control and eradication programme in the Mekong region (Myanmar, Thailand, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Cambodia and Vietnam) of South-East Asia and evaluatesthe FMD control programme in one of the region's countries, namely Cambodia. Significant progress has been made, and the strategy for eradication is now both clearly understood and feasible in the Mekong. However, FMD control in this region requires more than just an effective vaccination strategy and regulatory support. Success will also depend on obtaining consensus and buy-in at all levels of the value chain,from input suppliers to consumers. Culturally and economically acceptable incentives must be in place to ensure that control measures are implemented, and those stakeholders who are expected to bear the risk and costs of control programmes must also be the main beneficiaries. The present institutional environment in the Mekong, and in particular in Cambodia, makes control and eradication of transboundary diseases difficult. Further work is required to ensure that control strategies are aligned with stakeholder needs and priorities, and actively improve smallholder welfare. Cattle producers and traders are crucial to the control of FMD in Cambodia. Economic incentives and education as well as regulation are required to ensure these stakeholders participate in this important transboundary disease eradication programme.

TI  - Potential impact of groundnut production technology on welfare of smallholder farmers in Ghana
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - This study was conducted to assess the potential impact of applying a new groundnut planting density on welfare of smallholder farmers in northern Ghana. We used data from on-farm experiments, focus group discussions, and a household survey. We followed three steps in our analysis. First, we conducted cost-benefit analysis in which we showed the economic advantage of the new technology over the farmers' practice. Second, we predicted adoption rates along timeline using the Adoption and Diffusion Outcome Prediction Tool (ADOPT). Third, using the results of the first and the second steps, we estimated the potential impact of the technology on poverty at household level using a combination of methods such as economic surplus model and econometric model. The cost-benefit analysis shows that increasing plant density increases farmers' financial returns i.e., the benefit-cost-ratio increases from 1.05 under farmers' practice to 1.87 under the best plant density option, which is 22 plants/sqm. The adoption prediction analysis shows that the maximum adoption rate for the best practice will be 62% which will take about nine years to reach. At the maximum adoption rate the incidence of extreme poverty will be reduced by about 3.6% if farmers have access to the international groundnut market and by about 2% if they do not have. The intervention will also reduce poverty gap and poverty severity. The results suggest that policy actions which can improve farmers' access to the international market will enhance farmers' welfare more than the situation in which farmers have access to domestic markets only. Furthermore, promoting a more integrated groundnut value-chain can broaden the demand base of the produce resulting in higher and sustainable impact of the technology on the welfare of groundnut producers and beyond.

TI  - Global and local sustainable certification systems: Factors influencing RSPO and Thai-GAP adoption by oil palm smallholder farmers in Thailand
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This paper investigates the factors that influence the adoption of RSPO and Thai-GAP certification by oil palm smallholder farmers in Thailand. A random sample of 77 RSPO certified, 108 non-certified RSPO, 87 Thai-GAP certified, and 67 non-certified Thai-GAP smallholder farmers were interviewed to investigate the factors explaining the RSPO and Thai-GAP scheme adoption, respectively. The logit model was used to analyse the relationships between the adoption and the decision-making factors of the farmers. The results show that membership of farmer groups, the goal of the scheme, and trust in the scheme are the most significant factors affecting the adoption of RSPO certification. Scheme payments have a negative influence on adoption. In case of Thai-GAP, the results show the scheme payment, the image, concerns about the quality of land and water, and trust in the scheme are the most significant factors affecting the adoption. Finally, these findings suggest new factors may be attributed to several issues, including trust in the scheme, membership of farmer groups, the scheme's goal, and trust in the scheme are the most significant. Designing and extension in influencing factors may play multiple roles in driving smallholder farmers to adopt sustainable certification schemes. This finding repeats that the usability of sustainable certification schemes in developing countries needs to be mobilised around a particular socio-cultural context. Including, understanding the factors affecting smallholder farmers' intention to adopt Thai-GAP or RSPO certification is very important to plan and promote these schemes among other farmers and transform the current cultivation practices into more sustainable palm oil production.

TI  - From policy to practice: An assessment of biosecurity practices in cattle, sheep and goats production, marketing and slaughter in Baringo County, Kenya
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Globally, biosecurity is instrumental in prevention, control and management of livestock diseases and protection of human health. It is defined, prescribed, adopted and enforced through global, regional and national frameworks, laws, policies and strategies. There is more biosecurity practice research conducted in developed countries than developing ones. Consequently, the gap between the ideals recommended in biosecurity frameworks and what is practical in under-resourced rural settings is poorly understood. This anthropological study sought to assess adoption of biosecurity practices across a cattle, sheep and goat value chains continuum to demonstrate where risks lie. The cross-sectional mixed-methods study took place in Baringo County, Kenya. Qualitatively, it utilized 26 focus group discussions with community members and 10 observational interviews with slaughter facility workers. Quantitatively, it included a household survey with 560 community members and a separate survey with 231 livestock traders. Results show that producers, traders and slaughter facility workers did observe some biosecurity practices but not others due but not limited to personal preference, limitations in veterinary service delivery and enforcement of some biosecurity measures, and lack of requisite infrastructure. The study concludes that the implementation of biosecurity measures in rural settings is more complex than envisioned in biosecurity policies and frameworks. It can be hampered by resource limitations, poor enforcement, and contestations with cultural practices. The study recommends that further studies on willingness to adopt biosecurity measures targeting community members in under-resourced settings be conducted to identify possible critical points of intervention at county and national levels.

TI  - Scaling Climate Smart Agriculture in East Africa: Experiences and Lessons
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) responds in order to sustain agriculture under a changing environment, and is a major priority in the development sphere. However, to achieve impact at scale, CSA innovations must address agricultural systems' context-specific and multi-dimensional nature and be purveyed through feasible scaling processes. Unfortunately, knowledge on the scaling of CSA innovations under smallholder farming systems and in the context of developing countries remains scant. Understanding scaling processes is essential to the design of a sustainable scaling strategy. This study aimed to draw lessons on scaling from 25 cases of scaling CSA, and related projects in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania implemented by public institutions, local and international research organisations, Non-Govermental Orginsations(NGOs), and community-based organisations. Generally, scaling follows a linear pathway comprising technology testing and scaling. Most cases promoted technologies and models geared towards climate change adaptation in crop-based value chains, and only a few cases incorporated mitigation measures. Efforts to engage the private sector involved building business models as a potential scaling pathway. The cases were very strong on capacity building and institutionalisation from local, national, and even regional levels. However, four critical areas of concern about the sustainability of scaling emerged from the study: (i) There is little understanding and capture of the dynamics of smallholder farming systems in scaling strategies; (ii) climate data, projections, and impact models are rarely applied to support the decision of scaling; (iii) considerations for the biophysical and spatial-temporal impacts and trade-offs analysis in scaling is minimal and just starting to emerge; and (iv) there are still challenges effecting systemic change to enable sustainable scaling. In response to these concerns, we propose investment in understanding and considering the dynamics of the smallholder farming system and how it affects adoption, and subsequently scaling. Programme design should incorporate climate change scenarios. Scaling programmes can maximise synergies and leverage resources by adopting a robust partnerships model. Furthermore, understanding the spatio-temporal impact of scaling CSA on ecological functioning deserves more attention. Lastly, scaling takes time, which needs to be factored into the design of programmes.

TI  - Sugarcane outgrower schemes model: Friend or foe? A question for smallholder farmers in Mozambique
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES
AB  - For decades, economic development has been a major challenge for scientists, policy makers and NGOs in sub-Saharan Africa. Among the alternatives, agro-industries have been acknowledged as a way to catalyze foreign investment and kick-start agricultural development through the engagement of smallholder farmers. In Mozambique, the outsourcing of sugarcane production to smallholders gains momentum as an alternative to the traditional plantation model for sugarcane production. International development programs, such as the EU initiatives, and local stakeholders believe that sugarcane can be a steppingstone for better access to infrastructure, employment and social services (e.g., health clinics and schools). In this paper, we explore the relationship between a sugarcane mill and smallholder farmers in Maputo province, Mozambique. Our main goal is to investigate key characteristics of the sugarcane outgrower scheme and the implications for sustainable local development. In October 2017, we interviewed 115 farmers from 17 sugarcane farmers' organizations (out of 23 total) in the districts of Manhica, Magude and Moamba (Maputo province), together with two managers from the sugar mill. Despite promising, our assessment shows that sugarcane fell short the benefits expected by farmers and development practitioners. Frustration is largely rooted in information asymmetry between farmers and the sugar mill. There is certainly a need to review the current production model to implement policies able to ensure farmers with trustworthy information throughout the sugarcane value chain (from field to market) and buffer strategies to cope with market instability and social vulnerability.

TI  - Access and Adoption of Hybrid Seeds: Evidence from Uganda
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES
AB  - Adoption of hybrid seeds remains low in many low-income countries. We conduct a field-experiment designed to measure the effect of offering hybrid maize seeds for purchase during a time when potential customers have high liquidity. Working with a large buyer of agricultural commodities in Northern Uganda, we randomly offer smallholder farmers the opportunity to purchase certified hybrid maize seeds at the same time as they visit the buyers' stores to sell crops from a previous harvest. 16% of those offered purchase hybrid seeds, and average adoption of hybrid maize among those offered increases by 8 percentage points compared to a control group who does not receive the offer. Among those who accept the offer, we see an increase in the propensity to plant hybrid maize of 50 percentage points. This effect is more pronounced for female farmers than for their male counterparts. Our findings suggest that providing access to certified agricultural inputs at the place and time of post-harvest sales is a promising strategy to increase input usage.

TI  - 3Rs Policy and plastic waste management in Thailand
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
CP  - 4th International Conference on Final Sinks (ICFS)
AB  - Plastic has become an important and integral part of society throughout the world due to its various applications, such as packaging, agriculture, automobile parts, electronic applications and medical devices. The plastic fabrication process can be modified to form various shapes, colors and specifications according to customer needs. Consequently, the amount of plastic waste is increasing due to the increase in plastic consumption because of the increasing population. Moreover, the problem of marine plastic debris is on the rise globally, including in Thailand, which results from the irresponsibility of mankind. Generally, plastic waste in Thailand can be generated from industrial processes and households. These two waste sources have caused the rise in plastic waste, which has contributed to the problem of waste management in Thailand. Additionally, Thailand is one of the contributors to the leakage of plastic waste into the ocean, which results from inefficient waste management. To reduce the impacts of plastic waste, effective measures have to be applied, such as reducing, reusing and recycling (3Rs) or energy recovery from plastic wastes. To ensure the proper management of solid waste, Thailand has established the National 3R Strategy and the National Master Plan for Waste Management (2016-2021). Furthermore, Thailand also launched a Plastic Debris Management Plan 2017-2021, which comprises several approaches, such as promotion and introduction of eco-packaging design and eco-friendly plastic substitution, development of the material flow for plastic containers and packaging inventory, implementation of the 3Rs (reduce-reuse-recycle) strategy for plastic debris management, and the promotion of education for relevant stakeholders in the field of plastics and its alternative materials. In addition, the options to create more effective plastic waste management are to implement legislation or revise the laws to improve the efficiency and reduce the amount of plastic waste, such as imposing plastic bag fees, strengthening the 3Rs measures, and encouraging the implementation of a circular economy in plastic value chains.

TI  - Cooperative membership and farmers' choice of marketing channels - Evidence from apple farmers in Shaanxi and Shandong Provinces, China
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Cooperatives are established to improve farmers' production conditions, to increase their bargaining power and to enable them to benefit from modem value chains. In China, farmers are members of a cooperative for multiple reasons. Little is known on whether and how cooperative membership affects farmers' choice of marketing channels. This paper examines determinants of farmers' choice of marketing channels, especially how cooperative membership impacts upon this choice. Our analysis is based on survey data collected in 2015 among 625 apple growing farm households in the provinces Shaanxi and Shandong. We employ endogenous switching probit models to deal with potential endogeneity of membership in estimating the determinants of marketing channel choices. We find that cooperative membership has a positive impact on selling to wholesalers and a negative impact on selling to small dealers, but no significant impact on selling to the cooperative itself. As products sold through cooperatives generally comply with relatively stringent food quality and safety standards, these results imply that policies promoting cooperative members to sell their products through cooperatives are likely to have a significant impact on food quality and food safety in China.

TI  - Analyzing Pathways of Nurturing Informal Seed Production into Formal Private Ventures for Sustainable Seed Delivery and Crop Productivity: Experiences from Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Sustaining crop production and productivity in sub-Saharan Africa requires the availability and use of quality seed of improved varieties by smallholder farmers. The private sector has been considered as the best way to sustain seed supply and crop productivity. Unfortunately, the private sector's share in the seed production and delivery in sub-Saharan Africa countries has not been very substantial for decades. As a consequence, farmer access to quality seed of recently released varieties remains very low. This manuscript analyzes the experiences of informal seed producers who graduated to formal private seed enterprises to understand the effectiveness of the support they receive to become viable seed ventures. We used comparative research methods to analyze the qualitative and quantitative data collected to understand the underlying mechanisms. The findings showed that the analyzed seed enterprises started with as little as about USD 300 and have already multiplied over tenfold their initial capital. They benefited from a wide variety of supports, e.g., quality seed production, marketing, partnerships, and value chain development trainings and infrastructures, from extension workers, research centers, national and international NGOs, and the other private seed enterprise operators like large public seed enterprises and agro-dealers. The seed enterprises are producing pre-basic, basic, and certified seed of cereals and self-pollinated legume crops delivered directly to farmers, institutional markets, and agro-dealers. The seed production data have been increasing for the past three years with an area expanding from about 30 ha to over 150 ha per year for chickpea. The seed production and delivery practices being employed are smallholder farmer-based practices that are environmentally friendly. For sustainable and reliable seed production and delivery systems in sub-Saharan Africa, a bold step is needed whereby the informal seed production entities are nurtured and upgraded into formal certified seed production ventures that deliver social and economic benefits to the promotors and the communities.

TI  - Impact of participatory training of smallholder pig farmers on knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding biosecurity for the control of African swine fever in Uganda
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - We evaluated the impact of a participatory training of pig farmers on knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of biosecurity relating to ASF control in two districts of Uganda using a randomized control trial (RCT). A total of 830 pig farmers from 32 villages were included in the study, with 425 farmers receiving training, while 405 did not. An item response theory model was used to assess the impact of the training on farmer's KAP. Logistic regression models were used to assess the factors that affected knowledge gain and change in attitude and practices after training. Focus group discussions (FGD) were carried out with selected farmers from the treatment group at the end of the intervention, to share their experiences and discuss potential factors that could hinder adoption of biosecurity in their communities. Results of the regression analyses showed that there was a significant effect of biosecurity training (p = .038) on gain in knowledge after 12 months, but there were limited changes in farmer's attitude and practice at 12 and 28 months after training. Pig production domain (peri-urban/urban production), group membership, gender (male) and education of the farmer positively influenced knowledge gain and attitude of farmers towards biosecurity. This paper provides empirical evidence on the impact of training intervention on biosecurity practices for disease prevention or control. In addition, it breaks down the components of the biosecurity practices and documents the specific challenges to its uptake by the farmers. It therefore relaxes the assumption of knowledge constraint as a barrier to uptake. The results clearly show that knowledge is not the binding constraint to uptake of the biosecurity interventions.

TI  - Characterization of production systems and management practices of the cattle population in Zambia
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - This study was an attempt at the analysis of the Zambia cattle population, its production systems and management practices using data collected during the 2017/2018 livestock and aquaculture census. The Public User Microdata Sample dataset provided by the Central Statistics Organization were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Traditional system and free range grazing were found to be the main production system and feeding practices (97.2%). Despite large expanse of arable land, crop and fodder production, there was poor integration with cattle production system thus predisposing the animal to poor productivity due to inadequate nutrition. The management practices were found to be limiting and a hindrance to improved performance. The study revealed diverse cattle genetic resources comprising of local and exotic breeds, and their crosses at different genetic proportions. The local breed crosses were mainly directed at exotic beef breeds (and evidence of crosses with exotic dairy breeds) as smallholder farmers tend to improve on the production performances and productivity. Disease prevalence was high and had been an impediment to the growth of the cattle industry. It was clear that cattle production development must be anchored on a value chain system approach. Efforts aimed at capacity building should be targeted at the smallholder farmers with the bulk (93.5%) of the cattle population. This should include impacting farmers with husbandry skills through provision of elaborate livestock extension services aimed at integrating crops and fodder production in feeding practices, communal grazing management and adequate access to veterinary services to control disease prevalence. Value addition and market development would be helpful in unlocking the potential of the beef meat and milk products industry.

TI  - Rice farm income diversification in Ghana and implications on household consumption expenditure
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose This study investigates implications of crop and income diversifications on consumption expenditure (welfare) of rice-producing households in Ghana. It further compares diversification by three rice production systems: two-season rain-fed, two-season irrigated and one-season rain-fed rice production. Design/methodology/approach Primary data were sourced from 225 rice farmers. Margalef index and three-stage least-squares were employed. Findings Majority of rice-farming households in Ghana diversify livelihoods. The extent of livelihood diversification differs among two-season rain-fed, two-season irrigated and one-season rain-fed rice-producing households. Credit, distance to district capitals, production purpose and number of farming seasons influence crop and income diversifications, and consumption expenditure of rice-producing households. While crop diversification reduces consumption expenditure, income diversification increases it. Crop and income diversifications positively influence each other. Consumption expenditure reduces crop diversification but increases income diversification. Practical implications Policy should be directed towards the promotion of more livelihood activities to boost rice farmers' welfare. There should be awareness creation and training programmes to enable rice farmers realize different economic activities within and outside the agricultural value chain. Originality/value Crop and income diversifications were measured as continuous response variables, unlike previous studies that used a binary response variable. The authors established a synergy among crop and income diversifications, and consumption expenditure (welfare). The authors further compared crop and income diversifications by three rice production systems: two-season rain-fed, two-season irrigated and one-season rain-fed rice production systems.

TI  - Urban farmers coping strategies in the wake of urbanization and changing market in Tamale, Northern Ghana
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Vegetable cultivation is a survival strategy for the urban population, especially with the increasing population, urbanization, and high unemployment rate. For decades, men have practiced vegetable cultivation in Tamale's metropolitan city, with women being involved at the last node of the value chain - marketing. Women are known as market queens, and culturally, sell foodstuff in the market, unlike men who can't do the same. These market queens buy vegetables from farm gates and sell them at wholesale prices to other market women who retail them in the market. An ethnographic study was carried out to understand how farmers carry out their farming activities and marketing in the face of changing market trends and urbanization and how urbanization and markets shape and regulate farmers' agricultural practices with implications for urban agricultural policy and town planning. Results show that urbanization has influenced urban and peri-urban land prices resulting in the leasing of prime agricultural lands by chiefs for industrial and residential purposes. As such, farmers cope by negotiating farmland with government and private institutions, with more success. Farmers also practice mixed cropping to buffer climatic shocks and address market gluts to meet household needs and income. Even though urbanization poses a risk for farmers, it also creates spaces where farmers' practices are reshaped as they network with agrodealers, buyers, and researchers in their everyday activities, contributing to urban gardening policies and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11.

TI  - Constraints to Cultivation of Medicinal Plants by Smallholder Farmers in South Africa
T2  - HORTICULTURAE
AB  - Growing demand for therapeutic products from indigenous medicinal plants has led to increased interest in its cultivation, which presents a viable option for improving smallholder farmers' livelihoods, as well as sustaining the availability of these resources for future generations. Serious bottlenecks however exist for subsistent farmers in the cultivation of these valuable plants. It was pertinent to probe whether the cultivation of medicinal plants provides feasible solutions to rural poverty, while effectively conserving threatened indigenous biodiversity. The paper employed a comprehensive review of existing literature to explore issues constraining smallholder farmers from involvement in a potentially lucrative plant value chain. Findings indicate challenges such as inadequate domestication of valuable plants species, continued over-harvesting from wild populations, poor knowledge of required agronomic practices, low efficacy perception regarding derivatives from cultivated plants, among others. These constraints occur alongside the conservation-oriented strategy driven by international conservation agencies and wholly adopted by the South African government. Recommendations to improve smallholder involvement in the cultivation of medicinal plants include support to research and extension, targeted inducement to smallholders, contracting and off-take agreements, aimed at promoting an alternative poverty-alleviation-focused economic development strategy. The review adds to the conceptual discourse related to plant diversity, resource conservation, poverty alleviation, and economic development

TI  - Leveraging Shared Interests to Advance Sustainable Food Safety Systems in Cambodia
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AB  - In many Low-Medium Income Countries (LMIC), smallholder farmer access to consumer-driven markets is limited by lack of knowledge, capital, appropriate technology and technical training. While technical innovations and new techniques can improve the quality, quantity and safety of agricultural products for the market, adoption of new technologies and practices by smallholder farmers is often hindered by additional social and logistical constraints. To address the wide range of problems experienced by smallholder farmers seeking a higher standard of living, both natural science and social science solutions are required. This pilot study describes a mechanism for overcoming multiple constraints smallholder farmers face when attempting to change their agricultural practices. Community-driven savings programs were organized around the shared interests of individuals involved in various aspects of the agricultural supply chain in six villages in Cambodia. These Shared Interest Savings Groups (SISGs) were initially designed to help members learn to (a) amass lump sums of capital for investments in agriculture, and once operational also served as an organizing platform to (b) collectively identify problems and test solutions, and (c) provide funding for early scaling of appropriate agricultural technologies. This case study proposes an innovative model for effectively mitigating multiple constraints that typically hinder LMIC agricultural advancements. The participatory, social learning SISG model is therefore a promising soft technology that warrants further testing at a larger scale to validate these findings.

TI  - Combining Total Cost of Ownership and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to Improve Cost Management in Family Farming
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Family farming is an important pillar of the global primary food sector and is characterized by a significant local and regional impact. The sustainability of these businesses depends greatly on the use of effective management practices in family farming and smallholder farmer's activities. However, there is a lack of methodologies to support decision making in this sector related to the recognition of all aspects involved in the acquisition of inputs. Commonly, the existing approaches are focused on cost as the major criterion, which might impact on the agribusiness sustainability in the short or long term. Furthermore, traditional cost-focused approaches should be complemented with multi-criteria aspects within comprehensive and practical methodologies. This paper presents a Cost Management Model (CMM) integrating the concepts of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), which includes both monetary and non-monetary attributes. The use of TCO was mostly focused on industrial applications and studies on costs in agribusiness are still scarce and incomplete. The model was applied to a set of agribusiness families in Southern Brazil to support the supplier selection process of the three main inputs (i.e., fertilizer, fungicide, and soybeans). A significant cost reduction of approximately 13% for fertilizers, 7% for fungicides, and 3% for soybeans can be achieved. The CMM can be applied by smallholder farmers in any region of the world, and its flexibility allows changes in weights and criteria at any time by the decision maker. Buyers are more prepared to select the best supplier for each input and the later can recognize how they are more or less competitive when all costs and relevant criteria are taken into consideration. It can be also applied from an industry-level perspective to highlight the industry's cost structure and value chain, supporting more focused and effective public policies namely the design of subsidies that mitigate relevant context costs and the investment in infrastructures. Both, subsidies and public investment, are of major importance in rural areas of developing countries.

TI  - Poultry, food security and poverty in India: looking beyond the farm-gate
T2  - WORLDS POULTRY SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB  - This paper reviews the major pathways through which the growth of poultry farming can contribute to improved nutrition and poverty reduction in India, including direct benefits from poultry farming, employment generation along the poultry value chain, and consumption of poultry meat and eggs. Poultry farming and full (or part) time employment along the supply chain only represent a path out of poverty for a limited number of households, whereas increased availability and affordability of poultry meat and eggs for both rural and urban poor, which are mostly net buyers of food, is the most effective way through which poultry sector development can contribute to improved nutrition (and poverty reduction). Public investments in support of backyard poultry farming development remain important for enhancing nutritional status and reducing vulnerability of many rural households. The promotion of selected small-scale market-oriented poultry units in rural areas is expected to contribute to improved nutrition and rural economic growth through increased supply and lower prices of animal proteins and second round productivity and employment effects. Large-scale commercial poultry integrators have comparative and competitive advantages in providing urban consumers, many of which also live below the poverty line, with affordably-priced poultry meat and eggs.

TI  - Barriers to Livestock Vaccine Use Among Rural Female Smallholder Farmers Of Nyagatare District In Rwanda
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Women comprise the majority of small livestock keepers, but the productivity of their livestock is constrained by limited access to vaccines that could prevent and control animal diseases. This study examined the factors driving low adoption of vaccination against Newcastle disease (NCD) and Rift Valley fever (RFV) among smallholder women farmers of Nyagatare District in order to identify appropriate strategies that can lead to improved livestock production. Focus group discussions and key informant interviews were used to collect data on the level of women's participation in household decision making and their involvement at different levels along the vaccine value chain (VVC) for the NCD and RVF. Data were collected from 55 chicken and goat farmers-36 of which were women-as well as representatives of chicken farmer cooperatives, sector veterinarians, agrovet shop owners, and personnel from local NGOs working on livestock production and improvement. Our results reveal that women's ability to use livestock vaccines is constrained by cultural norms that limit their decisions over productive assets and income that they can use for buying vaccines. Women are also hindered by unavailability of livestock vaccines, lack of information and knowledge about livestock vaccination, and limited access to veterinary extension services. Our results highlight a need to organize gender training targeting men and women to change the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that affect women's ability to make independent decisions regarding the purchase and use of vaccines. Women also need training on livestock disease management through vaccination and easy access to veterinary services.

TI  - Potentials and Opportunities of Wild Edible Forest Fruits for Rural Household's Economy in Arasbaran, Iran
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) contribute to local people's livelihood in many regions around the world. This article investigates the types of NTFPs collected, processed, and traded in the Arasbaran region of Iran, the roles of these products in household economies, and the potential contribution to rural household economies through the collection, processing, and marketing of NTFPs. Data were collected using household and community surveys as well as through secondary sources on the role of NTFPs within Arasbaran forests in Iran. The main NTFPs harvested by local people were fruits. The fruits from 14 woody species, including trees and shrubs, were harvested by local people. The average share of forest-harvested fruit to household income was 27 percent. The mean annual income derived from the harvest and sale of sumac and reddish blackberry in the sample rural household incomes was USD 1822 and USD 142, respectively. In regard to processing efficiency, plum, cornelian cherry, and sumac exhibited the highest processing efficiency. Better policy support would be needed along the whole value chain, starting with the forest management plans, to include fruit species. In addition, measures to support processing facilities as well as to promote trade and marketing beyond the local area would be highly important to develop the potential of forest fruits and other NTFPs. Besides technical and financial support, measures should include regulatory revisions as well as information, training, and awareness raising.

TI  - Can Producer Associations Improve Rural Livelihoods? Evidence from Farmer Centres in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - Rural producer associations are considered a potential community-driven solution to the problems of smallholder agriculture. This article evaluates the impact of organising female farmers into producer associations in Gujarat, India. The initiative provided training, information, access to inputs, risk mitigation, and market linkages. Over 18 months, the programme weakly increased members' non-farm income and access to output markets. It had stronger impacts on members' awareness and utilisation of financial services. Impacts were heterogeneous, varying by pre-existing socioeconomic conditions. These findings suggest that producer associations can lower transaction costs for smallholders, but that poverty alleviation may be a longer-term prospect.

TI  - Grain legume seed systems for smallholder farmers: Perspectives on successful innovations
T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - Grain legumes are nutritionally important components of smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Unfortunately, limited access to quality seed of improved varieties at affordable prices due to inadequate seed systems has reduced their contribution to improving nutrition and reducing poverty in these regions. This paper analyses four seed systems case studies: chickpea in Ethiopia and Myanmar; cowpea in Nigeria; and tropical grain legumes in Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda highlighting outcomes, lessons learned, and the enabling factors which supported the successful innovations. All four case studies highlighted at least some of the following outcomes: increased adoption of improved varieties and area planted; increased productivity and income to farmers; improved market access and growth; and significant national economic benefits. Important lessons were learned including the value of small seed packets to reach many farmers; the value of innovative partnerships; capacity building of value chain actors; and continuity and coherence of funding through Tropical Legumes projects II and III and the recently funded Accelerated Varietal Improvement and Seed Delivery of Legumes and Cereals in Africa (AVISA) project. Successful adoption of innovations depends not just on the right technologies but also on the enabling environment. The case studies clearly showed that market demand was correctly identified, establishment of successful partners and institutional linkages overcame constraints in production and delivery of improved seed to smallholders, and fostered conducive policies supported national seed systems. All were integral to seed system viability and sustainability. It is hoped that these examples will provide potential models for future grain legume seed systems efforts. In addition, the analysis identified a number of areas that require further research.

TI  - Entry and Exit of Informal Firms and Development
T2  - IMF ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Non-farm informal businesses comprise the majority of the firm distribution in developing countries. We document novel stylized facts about entry and exit of informal, non-farm firms using nationally representative panel data over 15 years and across regions with varying levels of local economic development in Vietnam. First, we find that informal businesses exhibit rates of entry and exit around 14-18% annually. Entry and exit rates are similar and highly correlated at a point in time, within industries, and within regions. They both decline over time and across space with economic development. Second, although market selection influences which firms survive, entry and exit have little net effect on aggregate (revenue) productivity or hiring of workers outside the household. This owes to overlapping labor productivity of entering and exiting firms and low subsequent productivity growth and hiring among the surviving entrants. Nonetheless, entry and exit are associated with large changes in individual income. Third, the large overlap in revenue of entering and exiting informal businesses and the high correlation between entry and exit rates are related to the education of owners and their economic activities before and after operating an informal business. Informal business owners are less educated on average than wage workers in the formal sector, but more educated than agricultural workers. The transitions in and out of operating an informal business reflect the underlying structure of economic activities of the working-age population, with education gaps also playing a role. The most common transition into non-farm businesses is to and from self-employment in agriculture. The likelihood of this transition declines with economic development, highlighting the role of net entry from agriculture into informal non-farm businesses in structural change.

TI  - The impact of credit on productivity of smallholder farmers in Ghana
T2  - AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of access to production credit on the productivity of smallholder farmers. Design/methodology/approach Data for the study were drawn from the Agricultural Value Chain Facility (AVCF), which was implemented in the Northern Region of Ghana. This paper uses the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to estimate the average treatment effect of access to production credit on the productivity of smallholder farmers. The rationale for the choice of this estimation technique is to control for selection bias since the treatment variable (access to production credit) was not randomised. The authors also test for the effect of hidden bias using "Rosenbaum bounds" sensitivity analysis. The study uses two control groups to examine the net effect of credit on productivity. Findings The results reveal that smallholder farmers with access to production credit increased productivity through investment in farm inputs. For the impact of credit on productivity using control Group 1, the result shows that farmers with access to credit increased their productivity by 0.170 metric tonnes per hectare and for control Group 2, the result shows an increase of 0.252 metric tonnes per hectare more than farmers who are without access to production credit. Originality/value The paper shows the importance of production credit in augmenting the production function of smallholder farmers.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of social and economic impact of African swine fever outbreaks in northern Uganda
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most important pig diseases, causing high case fatality rate and trade restrictions upon reported outbreaks. In Uganda, a low-income country with the largest pig population in East Africa, ASF is endemic.
   Animal disease impact is multidimensional and include social and economic impact along the value chain. In low-income settings, this impact keep people poor and push those that have managed to escape poverty back again. If the diseases can be controlled, their negative consequences can be mitigated. However, to successfully argue for investment in disease control, its cost-benefits need to be demonstrated. One part in the cost-benefit equations is disease impact quantification. The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the socio-economic impact of ASF outbreaks at household level in northern Uganda.
   In a longitudinal study, structured interviews with two hundred, randomly selected, pig-keeping households were undertaken three times with a six month interval. Questions related to family and pig herd demographics, pig trade and pig business.
   Associations between ASF outbreaks and economic and social impact variables were evaluated using linear regression models. The study showed that pigs were kept in extreme low-input-low-output farming systems involving only small monetary investments. Yearly incidence of ASF on household level was 19%. Increasing herd size was positively associated with higher economic output. The interaction between ASF outbreaks and the herd size showed that ASF outbreaks were negatively associated with economic output at the second interview occasion and with one out of two economic impact variables at the third interview occasion. No significant associations between the social impact variables included in the study and ASF outbreaks could be established. Trade and consumption of sick and dead pigs were coping strategies used to minimize losses of capital and animal protein.
   The results indicate that causality of social and economic impact of ASF outbreaks in smallholder systems is complex. Pigs are mostly kept as passive investments rather than active working capital, complicating economic analyses and further disqualifying disease control arguments based only on standard economic models.

TI  - Implications of COVID-19 on oxbow lake (Baors) Fisher's community, Bangladesh: resilience to food security against probable natural calamities
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - The purpose of studying the consequence of COVID-19 on oxbow lake (Baor) fisher's community is to counteract the negative impacts on livelihoods with food security and figure out diversified resilience options for sustaining basic needs of life. Individual questionnaire interviews, oral history, focus group discussion, and telephonic interviews were among the methodological techniques used to gather primary data. The Baor fisher's community was impaired with income, food and feeding habit, health and marketing. The Baor fishers had to stop harvesting or reducing the amount of fish harvest because of gradual decreasing of consumer demand and prices of fish during the course of COVID-19 pandemic period. The transportation costs were raised up to 50%-80%, while the prices of fish decreased by 15%-30% prior to the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. The frequency of fish consumption was significantly come down to 37.5%. Many households substituted fish to farm reared hens, eggs, domestic hens and ducks, lentils, and vegetables during the period of lockdown across the country. Supply chains of fish and fish culture inputswere disrupted due to inadequacy of transportation facilities. Many school- and college-going students were dropped outduring the ongoing pandemic situation due to their financial problems (10%) and early marriage (7.5%). The secondary sources of income (labor of netting in other aquaculture farms) of Baor fisher's community were also impaired. The resilience options of this study will be helpful to minimize the sudden economic crises, ensure dynamic fish value chains and food security, protect individuals from ongoing health hazards, and promote sustainable food production systems followed by social cohesion and stabilityagainst the prevailing challenges owing to the pandemic and other natural calamities.

TI  - Availability and use of mycotoxin binders in selected urban and Peri-urban areas of Kenya
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Aflatoxins are carcinogenic, toxic and immunosuppressive substances produced by some species of the fungal genus, Aspergillus. Consumption of aflatoxins can have serious health effects. Widespread in the tropical and sub-tropical world, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is found in many staple foods and feeds; after ingestion it is metabolized to aflatoxin M1 (AFM1), which transfers to milk. One option for reducing aflatoxin concentration in cow milk is addition of mycotoxin binders to animal feeds, but little is known about this practice in the smallholder dairy systems in developing countries. We undertook a study to investigate the availability and use of mycotoxin binders in selected urban and peri-urban areas of Kenya. Data were collected using key informant interviews with government officials and one-to-one questionnaire-guided interviews with agrovet outlets (shops that sell animal health products (such as antibiotics) and crop inputs (such as fertilizers) and feed processors. Nine different mycotoxin binder types were reported. They were sold by 8% (4/49) of agrovets and 33% (3/9) of feed processors. The binders were purchased by farmers formulating their own feeds and by feed processors. Our review of regulations found that incorporating binders into animal feeds is not mandatory and there are no specific standards governing their use in Kenya. Feed processors are expected to respect the maximum allowable limit of 5g/kg for AFB1 in complete feeds. Gaps in the local feed supplies that may potentially lead to increased risks of aflatoxin exposure through milk are discussed. This study provides key data on the availability and local use of mycotoxin binders, which were previously lacking. However, there is a need for continued research on their effectiveness in the local smallholder context, in order to promote their appropriate use.

TI  - Transformation Toward Sustainability on a Costa Rican Coffee Farm: Environmental, Socioeconomic, and Psychological Perspectives
T2  - CASE STUDIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT
AB  - This case study examines how smallholder coffee producers can overcome the economic and environmental challenges from dominant production structures of agrochemical application and the sale of unprocessed beans at low, market-determined prices. This study is guided by the questions posed by local coffee farmers themselves: How can one successfully shift away from wasteful and harmful practices to those that support the health of the family, community, and environment? We track how El Toledo Coffee Farm in Costa Rica has harnessed natural systems and knowledge sharing, facilitated by international travel to transform challenges into opportunities. Here, we highlight how this family-run coffee farm has (1) implemented agroecological methods, (2) harnessed economic benefits of processing organic coffee and developing innovative products from coffee fruits, and (3) examine psychological factors that have made these transformations possible. By examining the development of integrated coffee production from three distinct academic perspectives, we found that mental flexibility and receptiveness to new ideas, combined with an appreciation of sustainable, traditional practices and values, have spawned various beneficial agroecological practices. These ideas and practices were often initiated by interactions with visitors to the farm, supporting the idea that globalization can foster sustainable food systems and promote collective ecological action through knowledge transfer and shared concern for local environments and communities. The mentality of embracing challenges as opportunities to invest in healthy soils and agroforestry and expand their business model by offering tours and varied products replicates ecological resilience attained through diversity.

TI  - Market participation and marketing channel preferences by small scale sorghum farmers in semi-arid Zimbabwe
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - A fundamental concern of agricultural development is the efficient marketing of goods and services. This paper examines the determinants of market participation and marketing channel choice decisions by small scale sorghum farmers using a case comprising 380 households from five Wards in the mid Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe. Mixed data collection approaches including a questionnaire, observations and focus group discussions were used. Secondary data triangulated and validated farmers' responses. A double hurdle based on probit and multinomial logit regression models was applied to the two decision making stages. Ninety six percent of the sampled farmers participated in some market as influenced by payment time, number of buyers in the market, age of principal decision maker and distance to market. Three marketing channels were isolated as local, traders and a combination. The local marketing channel dominates due to its convenience and relatively lower transaction costs. Using the local market option as the referent category, weighted average market price of sorghum, number of buyers in the market, distance to the market, dependency ratio and household income are the most robust determinants of marketing channel selection. Sorghum marketing channel options are limited for small scale farmers in Zimbabwe. Strengthening cooperative based and extension anchored marketing can reduce the risks associated with relating to external traders who usually exploit farmers for price, payment time and quality requirements. Decentralisation of the sorghum markets and promotion of value addition activities in the sorghum value chain is likely to reduce transaction costs and increase the market size.

TI  - Post-harvest Constraints of Solanaceae Species Produced in Kabare Wetlands, Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - The Kabare territory wetlands produced a significant quantity of solanaceous crops (potato, tomato and eggplant, etc.). One of the observations is the fact that significant losses are being observed during production and mostly after harvesting. The objective of this study was to assess the post-harvest constraints of the main solanaceous crops grown in these wetlands. A survey was carried out among 225 randomly selected households from four wetlands that lied down six districts to characterize the producers, identify the post-harvest techniques used and the constraints observed. Samples of solanaceous products were preserved for 15 days according to the local preservation techniques used to evaluate their effectiveness. The results showed that the producers face numerous post-harvest constraints of three types: structural, technical, and technological. These constraints a varied from value chain actor group to another. Most of the methods used by producers were mostly classified as moderately effective, and did not allow the quality of the products to be preserved, while quantitative losses remained very significant high. Besides, other external factors such as environmental and socio-economic factors contributed significantly also to these losses. Much losses are observed on tomato than on potato and eggplant; only a few preservation methods were classified as effective, notably tuber sorting (- 60%), the use of ice cubes (- 65%), and the use of pesticides (- 70%). Methods such as spreading out in a corner of the house (60%) and storage in the bag (50%) were classified as less effective for more than half by the farmers. Although suffering significant losses, these solanaceous crops provided important household income and thus contributed to food security in the area. Crop production and preservation have to be improved while effective production practices in Kabare and South-Kivu wetlands, eastern of DR Congo, have to be implemented.

TI  - The (in)visible market of miriti (Mauritia flexuosa L.f.) fruits, the "winter acai", in Amazonian riverine communities of Abaetetuba, Northern Brazil
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - While the sale of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is nearly invisible in and marginal to official economic statistics, it is an important source of income for many rural populations in Amazonia. This paper discuss a NTFPs production and marketing chain (Mauritia flexuosa fruits) in Abaetetuba County, Northern Brazil. Research was carried out using the following methods: participant observation, application of semi-structured questionnaires, and by accompanying production during harvest months in 2015. Data show that this channel is made up of many actors, including riverine people (ribeirinhos), middlemen and merchants in Abaetetuba and other regions in Amazonia. Fruits are sold through short distribution channels in Abaetetuba, contributing to up to 80% of all income produced by ribeirinhos during winter months; miriti income ranges from 918.00USD to 2006.00USD per household per harvest depending on the distribution channel used. These values are equivalent to those obtained from acai (Euterpe oleracea) sales obtained by acai producers who employ moderate management levels in Amazonia, a fact that leads ribeirinhos to consider miriti the "winter acai". The importance of miriti fruit and product sales for households in the study area is striking, and as such, policies to strengthen NTFP value chains are in great demand.

TI  - Mixed-sex Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) can perform competitively with mono-sex stocks in cage production
T2  - AQUACULTURE
AB  - All-male tilapia stocks are widely used by farmers to supply both domestic and international markets with homogenous, large sized fish (500 g+). While a number of strategies are possible, hormonal treatment of fry with 17a-methyltestosterone (MT) is the most common method used by commercial farmers due to its low cost and ease of application. However, contrasting to its current widespread use, the implications of MT in tilapia farming have raised concerns especially from public and environmental perspectives. Therefore, in this study we tested the impact of stocking a mixed-sex fast growing strain of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fry at high density and then grading out females at 4 or 8 weeks intervals during grow-out and compared final production with a standard MT-treated mono-sex system. From a production perspective, the strategies to remove females at 4 or 8 weeks were successful as no differences in harvest weight, survival and feed conversion rate were observed when compared to the MT-treated group. Similarly, no differences at harvest were obtained in terms of external appearance, Fulton's condition factor, gonadosomatic index, fillet yield, fat-somatic index and visceral-somatic index (%) between MT-monosex group and the groups where females were removed (4 or 8 weeks). However, a financial analysis of this approach showed that the additional costs (fry, feed and labour) involved in the mixed-sex strategy resulted in lower profits. This could be mitigated if a proportion of the removed females could be sold at a premium price as potential broodstock. In the model presented, sales of 13% of the removed females for broodfish at current Thai prices, or a premium of at least 8% for non-sex-reversed final product would be sufficient for the mixed-sex system to return a higher profit than the mono-sex system. The latter strategy could also enable further social licence through use of small fish in nutritional and outgrower initiatives.

TI  - Unpacking Indonesia's independent oil palm smallholders: An actor-disaggregated approach to identifying environmental and social performance challenges
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Processes of globalization have generated new opportunities for smallholders to participate in profitable global agro-commodity markets. This participation however is increasingly being shaped by differentiated capabilities to comply with emerging public and private quality and safety standards. The dynamics within Indonesia's oil palm sector illustrate well the types of competitive challenges smallholders face in their integration into global agro-commodity chains. Because of public concern over the poor social and environmental performance of the sector, many governments, companies and consumers are attempting to clean up the value chain through self regulatory commitments, certification and public regulation. As a result, many of Indonesia's oil palm smallholders face compliance barriers due to informality and poor production practices, and threaten to become alienated from formal markets, which could in turn lead to a bifurcation of the oil palm sector. Recognizing that many oil palm smallholders lack compliance capacity, myriad public and private actors have begun designing initiatives to address compliance barriers and enhance smallholder competitiveness. However, failure to properly account for the heterogeneity of the smallholder oil palm sector will undermine the effectiveness and scalability of such initiatives. By developing a typology of independent smallholder oil palm farmers in Rokan Hulu district, Riau province, this article reveals the wide diversity of actors that compose Indonesia's smallholder oil palm economy, the types of compliance barriers they face and the sustainable development challenges they pose. In doing so, this article illustrates how global agro-commodity chains can drive agrarian differentiation and offer new insights into the complex dynamics of agricultural frontier expansion.

TI  - Constraints to the capacity of smallholder farming households to adapt to climate change in South and Southeast Asia
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Rural households in developing countries face a range of pressures to secure their livelihoods. Households feel the effects of changing rainfall patterns, droughts, cyclones, floods and increased temperatures, and draw on a wide range of resources to adapt but some households are better equipped than others. We explore the extent to which smallholder rural households might be able to adapt to the processes of increased climate variability or climate change through assessing their adaptive capacity using elements of the rural livelihoods framework. We involved almost 600 participants in discussions and interviews in India, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Lao PDR to explore the factors that condition their ability to adapt. We identified 36 key indicators of adaptive capacity, half were specifically related to climate change or climate variability, with others recognized as important in terms of overall livelihoods. "Experience", "health" and "labour" (Human capital), "access to market" and "farmer networks/groups" (Social capital) were considered strongly enabling of adaptation, whereas "lack of training" (Human capital) and "soil quality/condition" (Natural capital) constrained adaptation. It takes time for households to recover from climatic events, but, households with better access to diverse resources, and a more balanced livelihood portfolio were better able to cope. Mechanisms to support adaptation involved supporting farmer groups, novel information networks, better access to markets and value chains, land ownership, improved financial and economic management, and credit options.

TI  - Microbial Contamination and Hygiene of Fresh Cow's Milk Produced by Smallholders in Western Zambia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - A field study was performed to assess safety of smallholder fresh cow's milk around Mongu, Western Province, Zambia. This involved observation and sampling of milk along the value chain from milking to point-of-sale and storage. Samples were collected from 86 cows, from 9 farmers, selling through two dairy cooperatives, with additional samples from informal markets. Production was very low; around one litre/day/cow and 10 L/day/herd. The milk was typically transported by bicycle in high ambient temperatures without refrigeration until reaching the point-of-sale (journey times of 30-120 min), where it was sold without pasteurisation despite milk-borne zoonoses being endemic (bovine tuberculosis (bTB) and Brucellosis). Although microbiological contamination was initially low, with geometric mean total bacterial count (TBC) of 425 cfu/mL (cfu = colony forming units) upon arrival at point-of-sale, poor hygiene led to high bacterial loads later on (geometric mean TBC > 600,000 cfu/mL after two days refrigeration), with almost all samples culture positive for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. After milking, milk was kept for 100-223 min at temperatures favouring microbial growth (median 34 degrees C) and sold without a microbial kill step. In this situation limited variation in observed standards of milk hygiene had no significant effect on milk end-product bacterial counts. Options for refrigerated transport are limited. Pasteurisation at the cooperative should be investigated, as this would largely remove pathogenic microbes present in the milk whether resulting from cattle infection or poor hygiene during milking and transportation. As milk is also purchased directly from producers, on-farm milk heating options should also be assessed. Smallholders may benefit from access to national markets by providing milk to large dairies, which have systems for ensuring safety. However, this requires significant investment and an increased and more consistent supply of milk; and many consumers, unable to afford milk sold through formal sectors, would not benefit.

TI  - Household production and consumption patterns of Teff in Ethiopia
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - Teff (Eragrostis tef) is a major staple grain of Ethiopia, where the crop was domesticated from 4000 to 1000 BC. The high food-value Teff flour is basically used for preparing injeraa spongy pancake, the major component of the Ethiopian national dish. Due to its gluten-free quality and high mineral content, the popularity of TeffTeff has been increasing in the western world. Very little is known, about the households that produce and consume Teff in Ethiopia. Using information from more than 9000 households collected by the World Bank and the Central Statistical Agency-Ethiopia in 2011-2012 and 2013-2014, and applying econometric estimation approaches, this study reveals that Teff is mainly produced by uneducated, male-headed rural households which have access to relatively more land and more family labor. In contrast, a higher proportion of Teff is consumed by urban households and those headed by an older, educated head. Based on the findings, this study asserts that the productivity of Teff should be enhanced by developing and disseminating high-yielding varieties as Teff consumption has been increasing in general and, secondly, the resource-poor Teff cultivators should be linked with the global value chain which may bring extra benefits to them in Ethiopia; however, the loss of domestic consumers' surplus should also be considered economically.

AB  - Forest products have become scarce for local communities in the Philippines. After decades of severe deforestation, a net gain in forest area has only been observed in recent years for the first time. This paper seeks to broaden the understanding of forest livelihood relationships at the turning point of a forest transition trajectory. Based on 993 household surveys from 10 distinct research sites, we use Hierarchical Cluster Analysis to identify six distinct livelihood strategies (LS): remittances-based, livestock-based, crop farming-based, business-oriented, natural resource-based, and wage-based strategies. The highest number of households belongs to the wage-based cluster, which also shows the highest total income. Forest-related incomes only account for small shares of total income for the vast majority of households, although most households collect limited quantities of forest products for domestic use. Nevertheless, one cluster, which includes 12.4% of the sample, generates the largest shares of their income from extractive activities like harvesting forest products and fishing. The households relying most strongly on natural resources in our study sites are also the ones with the lowest total income. Our finding implies that future reforestation policies have to put a special focus on incorporating livelihood benefits for local communities. This should go beyond short-term payments for activities such as tree planting and enable the rural households to derive long-term impacts for human well-being and poverty alleviation. Because most of the forest products reported by our surveyed households were collected for domestic use, they did not contribute much to total household income. This indicates a potential for improving rural income, if forest-product value chains at the smallholder level are improved by future policy interventions.

TI  - Understanding variability in carbon footprint of smallholder dairy farms in the central highlands of Ethiopia
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - Smallholder dairy farms face enormous challenges in increasing milk production while mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thereby enhancing climate resilience. The carbon footprint (CF) of smallholder milk production is expected to increase with increasing demand for dairy products under the business-as-usual scenario. This study estimates the carbon footprint of smallholder milk production and examines variation across farms using data from 480 households to identify viable options for mitigating GHG emissions. We applied a cradle to farm-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to examine the effects of farming systems on GHG emission intensities across intensification gradients of smallholder farms (SHF) from four potential dairy districts in the central highlands of Ethiopia. According to our findings, enteric fermentation was the primary source of GHG emissions, and methane (CH4) emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management accounted for the majority of total emissions across farms. The estimated average CF varies depending on farming systems, global warming potential (GWP), and allocation methods used. When GHG emissions were allocated to multiple products using economic allocation and based on IPCC (2007) and IPCC (2014) GWPs, the overall average CF of milk production was 1.91 and 2.35 kg CO(2)e/kg fat and protein-corrected milk (FPCM), respectively. On average, milk accounted for 72% of total greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of farm typology, rural SHF systems produced significantly more CF per kg of milk than urban and peri-urban SHF systems. Variations in milk yield explained more than half of the variation in GHG emissions intensity at the farm level. Feed digestibility and feed efficiency had a negative and significant (P < 0.01) association with CF of SHF. Our findings suggested that improving feed digestibility and feed efficiency by increasing the proportion of concentrate and improved forage as well as chemically upgrading straw and crop residue could provide an opportunity to both increase milk yield and reduce the CF of milk production of SHF in the study area. Supporting SHF to realize strategies contributing to climate-resilient dairy development require interventions at several levels in the dairy value chain.

TI  - Inclusive Businesses and Land Reform: Corporatization or Transformation?
T2  - LAND
AB  - Inclusive businesses (IBs), embodying partnerships between commercial agribusinesses and smallholder farmers/low-income communities, are considered to contribute towards rural development and agricultural sector transformation. Structured as complex organizational set-ups consisting of, and overcoming the limitations of, standard inclusive instruments (collective organization, mentorship, supply contract, lease/management contract and equity), they allow for the inclusion of smallholders and low-income communities into commercial agricultural value chains. IBs are a way for governments to engage private agribusinesses in agricultural and rural policies. However, will the commercial sector, through IB partnerships, contribute towards the government's transformation and developmental objectives? Based on case studies in South Africa-a country engaged in land and agrarian reforms-the effects of IBs at the project level appear positive, illustrated by an increase in production and growth in agricultural assets. However, individual beneficiaries experience only a marginal change in income and livelihoods. Whereas land reform, project development and market integration are generally achieved, the transformation and beneficiary development objectives are compromised. Although commercial agribusinesses contribute to investment needs in the sector and smallholder exposure to commercial markets, IB partnerships allow commercial entities control over the smallholders' assets. Ownership and secure rights, especially of land, and support of external parties to capacitate beneficiaries and adjust power asymmetries, are essential starting points. Without these aspects, IBs will not lead to effective transformation and development.

TI  - Rethinking Blended High Yielding Seed Varieties and Partial-Organic Fertilizer Climate Smart Agriculture Practices for Productivity and Farm Income Gains in the Drylands of Zimbabwe
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Most blended climate smart agriculture (CSA) technologies focusing on seed-fertilizer combinations have either been marginally adopted or dis-adopted by smallholder farmers due to the nature of design and implementation. A data science research approach was used with 380 households in the mid-Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe. The study examines impact of adopting a farmer initiated CSA practice combining improved sorghum seed variety and partial-organic fertilizer on household income and productivity among smallholder farmers in the drylands of Zimbabwe. A cross sectional household survey using multi stage sampling with purposive and stratified proportionate approaches was conducted. A structured questionnaire was utilized for data collection. Endogenous Switching Regression (ESR) model was utilized to account for self-selection bias of sampled farmers. Overall, a combination of farm specific factors (arable land, variable costs) and external factors (distance to the market, value of aid) have a bearing on the adoption decision and the associated impact on productivity and income. The counterfactual analysis shows that farmers who adopt the technology are relatively better off in productivity and income. Our findings highlight the significance of improving access to CSA practices which are initiated by the farmers using a bottom-up approach since they suit their operating contexts better. Tailor-made supporting programs including farmer networking platforms and decentralized markets need to be designed and scaled up by policymakers to encourage farmers to adopt blended soil fertility CSA practices in their farming practices. Networking arrangements need to be strengthened through local, government and private sector partnerships along the sorghum value chain.

TI  - Impact pathways of voluntary sustainability standards on smallholder coffee producers in Honduras: Price premiums, farm productivity, production costs, access to credit
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Coffee production in Honduras is under constant economic pressure, social unrest, and climate challenges. This largely affects the living conditions of thousands of smallholder coffee producers as the weakest actors in the coffee value chain and exacerbates the level of poverty and inequality that they face. A considerable part of the coffee production in Honduras is under different Voluntary Sustainability Standards (VSS); a major goal of these standards is to improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. Thus, this paper assesses the economic impact of Fairtrade, UTZ, and 4C on smallholder producers against a control group, using Propensity Score Matching with data of the coffee year 2015/2016. The main economic variables studied in this paper are gross profit, household income, and poverty likelihood. In addition, this study develops a conceptual framework to explore different impact pathways -price premium, farm productivity, production costs, and access to credit- that could improve farm performance and ultimately the economic conditions of farmers. The results of this study suggest that smallholder coffee producers in Honduras are not obtaining a higher economic impact from the different cer-tifications assessed. Among the pathways, only the price premium was statistically significant for the three certifications assessed, displaying higher prices per unit than the control group. In line with their economic conditions, these producers have a probability between 56% and 58% of living under the national poverty line according to the Poverty Probability Index (PPI), concluding that certifications do not always improve the livelihood of coffee producers.

TI  - Regeneration and Restoration Status of Miombo Woodland Following Land Use Land Cover Changes at the Buffer Zone of Gile National Park, Central Mozambique
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - In the context of the current intensified disturbances of Miombo woodland, its regenerating capacity is funda-mental to endure such disturbances. Miombo woodland in the buffer zone of Gile National Park (GNAP) is facing land cover change. This study aimed to assess regeneration structure, the status of restoration, and factors affecting the regeneration of Miombo woodland in the buffer zone of GNAP. In total, 12 transects, 48 plots, and 240 subplots were sampled in dense Miombo woodland (DMWL), open Miombo woodland (OMWL), and abandoned agricultural land (AAL) to collect data. Household interviews, focus group discussions (FGD), and key informant interviews(KIIs) were used to collect socio-economic data. Descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square, and regression, were used to analyze data. A total of 1863 matured woody individuals representing 85 species and 29 families were identified. Matured woody species density was significantly different between AAL&DMWL and DMWL & OMWL. However, there was no significant difference between OMWL and AAL. Nine hundred three regenerated individuals representing 70 species and 23 families were registered. Regeneration density was significantly different between land-use types. The mean regeneration density in DMWL, AAL, and OMWL were 39.87 +/- 13.82, 50.25 +/- 21.1, and 23 +/- 9.98 stems ha-1, respectively. The most regenerated family was Fabaceae. All respondents reported that no assisted restoration activity was/is taking place in the area. The five most important factors affecting the regeneration of Miombo woodland were identified. Slash and burn agriculture and animal grazing were ranked first and last, respectively. Increasing pressure for land demand is determining factor for Miombo woodland regeneration. The buffer zone of GNAP is characterized by a moderate diversity of woody species, with the number of regenerated woody species increasing in AAL. Our findings suggest the importance of diversifying sources of income, creating a market value chain for their product, and strengthening collaboration between the park and the community surrounding the park could reduce the dependence of the community on slash and burn agriculture as well as safeguard the park from degradation and at the same time maintain the livelihood of the community.

TI  - Food Production Diversity and Diet Diversification in Rural and Urban area of Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The food security paradigm shifted from diet quantity to diet quality and consumption of a satisfactory amount of micronutrients around the world. Low dietary diversification and imbalance consumption of food groups are the main characteristics of Iranian households. Food production diversity can be a significant determinant of dietary diversity in developing countries such as Iran. Thus, this research tries to examine the impact of food production diversity alongside the socioeconomic and sociodemographic determinants on dietary diversity in rural and urban areas of the country. For this aim, a panel data set is constructed based on all the available data in rural and urban areas of 31 provinces of Iran from 2011 to 2016 and panel quantile regression applied to investigate the impact of the control variables. The main results indicate that food production diversity, household income, the share of food in household expenditure, literacy rate have a positive and significant impact on the dietary diversity in rural and urban regions of the country. Moreover, the food price index has a negative and significant effect on dietary diversity in both regions. Finally, the age of head of household and family size only has a negative impact on diet diversification in rural areas. According to these results, encouraging small farmers to change their production patterns to a more diverse pattern in a short time, and pursuing multidimensional approaches such as the promotion of agricultural value chain should be considered by policymakers to improve the dietary diversity in rural and urban areas. Furthermore, the establishment of rural retirement found and redistribution of current income subsidy can help the elderly and extended family in rural areas to enhance their diet quality. Finally, design a price monitoring approach alongside a flexible trade strategy to manage the food market prices can help households to consume the appropriate diet with enough micronutrients.

TI  - Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Agricultural Food Production among Smallholder Farmers in Northern Drakensberg Areas of Bergville, South Africa
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected social and economic activities in the agriculture systems. The extent of pandemic disruptions on agriculture food production systems is lamentably scanty in rural areas. A survey was carried out in the Northern Drakensberg areas of Bergville, and it assessed the impact of COVID-19 on agricultural food production in smallholder farming systems comprising crop-livestock systems. A survey was conducted using structured questionnaires that measured the impact of COVID-19 within farming operations and average crop yield trends pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19. Most farmers (77.1 to 92.4%) reported having limitations in accessing agricultural inputs of seeds, fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicated a continuous decrease in yields of maize, dry beans, and soybeans across two years of cropping seasons during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study demonstrated that COVID-19 lockdowns accompanied by movement restrictions negatively impacted food production of staple crops (maize, dry beans, soybeans) despite suitable rains received during COVID-19 production periods. COVID-19 policies and legislations sensitive to the plight of poor rural communities are necessary as these communities are more reliant on local agricultural food production for their livelihoods and income. Strong co-operations must be established among input suppliers, smallholder farmers associations, extension services, and local retailers to assist smallholders to obtain inputs at local retailers even during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.

TI  - Sorghum Production in Northern Namibia: Farmers' Perceived Constraints and Trait Preferences
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench) is a valuable crop in the dry regions of the world, including Namibia. Due to the intensity and recurrence of drought and heat stress in the traditional sorghum growing areas, there is a need to breed and deploy new generation farmer-preferred and climate-smart cultivars to serve the diverse value chains. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to assess the present state of sorghum production in northern Namibia and document farmers' perceived production constraints and trait preferences in new varieties to guide drought-tolerance breeding. A survey was conducted using a participatory rural appraisal in the following six selected sorghum-growing constituencies in Namibia: Kapako and Mpungu (Kavango West Region), Eenhana and Endola (Ohangwena Region), and Katima Mulilo Rural and Kongola (Zambezi Region). Data were collected using a structured questionnaire involving 198 farmers in 14 sampled villages across the regions. Results revealed variable trends in sorghum production among respondent farmers when disaggregated by gender, age, number of households, education level, cropping systems, types of varieties grown, and perceived production constraints. An equal proportion of male and female respondent farmers cultivate sorghum, suggesting the value of the crop to both genders in Namibia. Most respondent farmers (63.6%) were in productive age groups of <40 years old. In the study areas, low-yielding landrace varieties, namely Ekoko, Okambete, Makonga, Kamburo, Nkutji, Katoma, Fuba, Dommy, Kawumbe, and Okatombo, were widely cultivated, and most of the farmers did not use chemical fertilizers to cultivate sorghum. Farmers' perceived sorghum production constraints in the study areas included recurrent drought, declining soil fertility, insect pest damage, high cost of production inputs, unavailability of improved seed, lack of alternative improved varieties with farmers' preferred traits, lack of organic manure, limited access to market and limited extension service. The key farmers' preferred traits in a new sorghum variety included high grain yield, early maturity, and tolerance to drought, in the field and storage insect pests. The study recommends genetic improvement and new variety deployment of sorghum with the described farmers-preferred traits to increase the sustainable production of the crop in Namibia.

TI  - De-commoditizing Ethiopian coffees after the establishment of the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange: an empirical investigation of smallholder coffee producers in Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - The repercussions of reforming an agricultural market are mainly observed at the most vulnerable segment of the value chain, namely, the producers. In the current commodity market created with trade through the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX), coffee is less traceable to its producers. Only cooperatives that sell certified coffee through the unions they belong to, are allowed to bypass the more commodified ECX market. This study aims to investigate if small-scale coffee producers in southwestern Ethiopia that sell coffee through the certified cooperative are better off. It is assumed that the coffee sales through, and membership of, a cooperative, allows farmers to improve their coffee production as well as to improve other aspects of their livelihood. A sustainable livelihood approach was used as the inspiration for the welfare indicators that needed to be considered, data collected amongst members and non-members of certified cooperatives, and a propensity score model to investigate the impact of cooperative membership on the livelihood indicators. Results suggest that members of certified cooperatives indeed receive, on average, better prices. Yet, no evidence was found that indicates that the higher price is translated into better household income. Furthermore, coffee plantation productivity of those members who were interviewed was lower than that of the non-members. This finding could explain the failure to find an overall effect. Since the majority of the producers' income emanate from coffee, a sustainable way of enhancing the productivity of the coffee could revitalize the welfare of the coffee producers.

TI  - Analysis of the agricultural innovation system in Indonesia: A case study of the beef sector in Nusa Tenggara Barat
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - CONTEXT: The demand for beef in Indonesia has increased over the last decade; however, national production barely meets half of the domestic demand. This gap creates an opportunity for beef smallholder farmers to improve their livelihoods by increasing their participation in the domestic market. Innovation is central to supporting smallholder farmers to benefit from this increase in beef demand in Indonesia.OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to analyse the barriers to the innovation system in the Indonesian beef sector in the province of Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB) to identify opportunities to increase smallholder beef productivity.METHODS: In the analysis, we applied the agricultural innovation system (AIS) framework to identify constraints for boosting beef production in the province. We used qualitative data (in-depth interviews and focus group discussions) collected in NTB and data from a literature review.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed significant constraints across all AIS functions that ultimately translated to poor innovation in the beef sector in NTB. The results showed that the beef innovation system is constrained by multiple factors, including the lack of farmers' professionalisation, lack of agricultural R&D in-vestments, underdeveloped beef value chain, and lack of incentives for PPPs.SIGNIFICANCE: These findings inform policy in NTB and increase smallholder beef productivity. Additionally, the findings point to constraints that are likely common in beef production in many developing countries, and that could be considered when developing policy in other areas in Indonesia.

TI  - Contract farming and the reorganisation of agricultural production within the Chokwe Irrigation System, Mozambique
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - This paper contributes to the discussion about inclusive business models' as alternatives to large-scale land acquisitions by analysing a case in which a foreign agribusiness investor, within an impact investment paradigm, acquired and rehabilitated a rice processing plant in Chokwe, Mozambique. A contract farming programme drawn up to source raw produce for the factory led to radical shifts in control over land and water resources. The case is set against the background of a large-scale irrigation system that has played an important role in national agricultural policies since colonial times. The private sector-led development approach is strongly supported by the state which portrays it as an opportunity to reduce its dependency on rice imports. The investor redirected the benefits of land and water use through taking a role of coordination and control within the irrigated production system.The ensuing rural transformation reminds one of earlier periods in the development of the irrigation system: the central control over production, and the very high level of agricultural inputs and mechanisation, remind one of the state socialist period, while the removal of smallholders from their land and its concentration in the hands of a few bears a strong resemblance to the scheme's establishment under colonial rule.

TI  - Inclusive businesses in agriculture: Defining the concept and its complex an evolving partnership structures in the field
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Inclusive Businesses (IBs), signifying sustainable and equitable commercial operations linking low-income communities and smallholder farmers with agri-businesses in order to facilitate the former's market integration, are considered to comprise an essential tool for raising smallholders, across the developing world, out of poverty and for stimulating overall rural development. Although often promoted based on anecdotal evidence, IBs are little analysed and understood from a conceptual perspective, nor are they scrutinised when implemented in the field. This paper aims to provide a more precise insight into IBs, from a conceptual perspective and from a more practical one when implemented. Based on extensive fieldwork and assessments of 14 IBs, this paper proposes a new, flexible typology for the institutional set-ups of IBs, which accommodates the complex structures observed in the field. These innovative and hybrid arrangements, explained by a holistic framework that combines aspects of Resource Dependence Theory, Transaction Costs Economics and Agency Theory, are presented as unique combinations of the standard instruments of collective organisation, equity, lease/management contracts, mentorships, and supply contracts. Results show that whereas multiple-instrument IBs do obtain improved in-clusiveness of low-income communities and smallholder farmers in commercial value chains, issues related to corporate control over resources, lack of knowledge transfer and marginal benefits remain. The assessed IBs are dynamic in their set-up, however, and allow for adaptations to overcome these issues. The State, which plays an important role through establishing a stimulating policy framework and financial contributions, together with third party engagement, can counter the potential corporatisation under IBs - emphasising that IBs alone cannot constitute the expected panacea for agricultural transformation and rural development.

TI  - An analysis of governance factors influencing performance of selected smallholder dairy cooperatives in Zimbabwe
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - Cooperatives are organisations owned and operated by individuals or groups that come together for mutual benefit including pooling of resources for the purchase of inputs and marketing of products. Marketing of milk is through dairy cooperatives where the milk collection centres are mandated to help integrating smallholder farmers into competitive markets. The study investigated governance structures of five smallholder dairy schemes purposively selected based on their agroecological regions in Zimbabwe. The aim of the study was to explore how the governing boards conduct their business, particularly marketing milk, and how this affects allocation of resources (milk production and deliveries to milk centres) by smallholder farmers. Qualitative data were collected using focus group discussions with 20 dairy cooperative members from each milk collection centre. Key informant interviews were conducted with chairpersons, management committee members, and dairy value chain stakeholders such as dairy associations and processors. The SWOT analysis technique was employed to identify governance structures highlighting major strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats as a gateway to isolating strategies for enhancing centre performance. An analysis of implications of the governance structures on resource allocation decision by farmers was also performed. So focus is on how boards are discharging mandate such as marketing on behalf of farmers, price setting and negotiations, trainings, and accountability to members. Such factors if executed well will see farmers increasing milk production and deliveries to MCC yielding positive results in income and profits. The study results show that poor governance mainly caused by incompetent boards and management committees was the major factor affecting performance. Other findings were that if good governance factors were in place, then cooperatives became proficient leading to their growth. Thus, cooperatives must adopt business models based on private sector partnerships to maximise on expertise and technical support. The schemes ought to take advantage of existing opportunities, especially policies that mitigate threats and improve product diversity, value addition, and effective pricing strategies. To achieve these milestones, capacity building roadmaps ought to identify competent and efficient boards.

TI  - Introducing cricket farming as a food security and livelihood strategy in humanitarian settings: experience from Kakuma Refugee camp, Kenya
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
AB  - Food and nutrition security interventions have struggled to supply sustainable protein-rich animal source foods in refugee camps due to high costs required and limited resources. Therefore, crickets farming was extended to refugee settings in Kenya as a potential source of protein and income. This paper discusses how cricket farming was introduced in Kakuma refugee camp and the utilization of crickets as food or feed. A thriving cricket colony was established in a site managed by DanChurchAid (DCA) in Kakuma refugee camp. The cricket colony was used to produce and supply cricket eggs to recruited and trained households who belonged to seven different nationalities. The project beneficiaries were selected using purposive sampling based on a set of predefined characteristics. Each household was provided with a cricket-rearing starter kit consisting of wooden pens, hides (carton egg trays), pin-head crickets, feed and water dispenser (cotton wool). Each household harvested 0.5 - 3.0 kg of fresh cricket per cycle of 1-2 months which was used as food (55.65%) or feed (44.35%). The crickets were processed by either sun drying, blanching or frying. The most dominant processing method was the combination of sun drying and frying that constituted 52.17% of the total processing. There was a significant correlation (P < 0.001) between intended use of crickets and processing methods. The crickets harvested had the potential to constitute > 30% of the recommended daily intake of protein and other micronutrients for women and children of different ages. Crickets showed a huge potential in mitigating food and nutrition insecurity in the camp although further efforts are required to strengthen the crickets value chain as food or feed.

TI  - Aspergillus flavus and aflatoxin contamination in the maize value chain and what needs to be done in Tanzania
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB  - Maize (Zea mays L.) is a major dietary staple in Tanzania but is frequently prone to aflatoxin contamination (AC) caused mainly by Aspergillus species. The magnitude of AC is compounded by low input agricultural practices, improper handling and storage of grain, extreme weather conditions as well as inadequate knowledge and action in management of the problem. Moreover, stakeholders in Tanzania, notably smallholder farmers, are largely unaware of aflatoxins and the health and trade risks they cause. Due to the toxic nature of aflatoxins, their incidences and levels in different food commodities are strictly regulated in developed countries. However, strict regulatory control of AC in food commodities is difficult in Tanzania because the authority cannot effectively deal with widely scattered smallholder farmers who grow and consume their maize, while the rest of the population also obtain their food through numerous small scale processors. As such, AC continues to be one of the key mycotoxin challenges in East Africa, and Tanzania in particular because of its adverse effect on food safety and security. Despite the considerable research attention devoted to aflatoxin in the recent past, there is still room for strategic short-term interventions that could help to reduce AC in the country. Increased awareness among Tanzanians, and promotion of an integrated suite of intervention measures, hinged on host plant resistance and Aflasafe biocontrol, seems to be the ideal strategy that ought to be pursued for sustainable reduction of A. flavus and AC in maize. This review intends to shed more light to stakeholders about Aspergillus fungi and the conditions that favour maize colonisation and aflatoxin production as well as possible management strategies that can help smallholder farmers in Tanzania to reduce AC. The review ends with recommendations on what needs to be done in the short term. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Nutrient composition and microbial food safety of a locally-processed fish product in Cambodia
T2  - AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Prahoc is a traditional, fermented fish product in Cambodian diets. Fermented products like Prahoc may play a range of beneficial roles nutritionally, culturally, and financially. However, the use of freshwater fish and long-term storage may also pose food safety risks of parasites and microorganisms. We conducted a mixed-methods study of Prahoc to describe the complex risks and benefits of this food that included semi-structured interviews (prahoc-producing households, n=22; small and medium enterprises n=6), production observation, sample collection and analysis of nutrient composition and food safety parameters. Nutrient composition analysis showed that while Prahoc contributes small amounts of zinc, iron, and other key minerals to the diet, it is also very high in sodium (similar to 101,621 mg kg(-1)). Food safety analyses showed that while further tests are needed to resolve Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Vibrio risks, all samples were in compliance with the Cambodia Standards for Prahoc, and there was no evidence of parasites. Participants described Prahoc as playing an essential dietary and cultural role, and also making important contributions to household welfare, particularly within households and businesses that sold Prahoc. Despite the potential risks of microbial food safety and high sodium intake, Prahoc production offers benefits by adding value to fresh fish, reducing loss and waste, and preserving the harvest. However, Prahoc production depends on fish availability and is limited by declining access and high prices. Thus, freshwater fisheries management should take into account Prahoc production activities, an important value chain activity that contributes to the livelihoods of rural Cambodian communities.

TI  - To sell or consume? Gendered household decision-making on crop production, consumption, and sale in Malawi
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Value chains and agricultural commercialization are increasingly being promoted as mechanisms for agricultural transformation, inclusive growth, and-more recently-improving food security and diets. Donors and implementers promote production of nutritious crops as a mechanism for improving the quality and diversity of diets of the rural poor. However, while there is a theoretical basis for this, there is a need for a deeper empirical understanding of how, under what circumstances, and through what pathways own-production of nutritious foods improves diets. This study examines the sociocultural drivers of gendered household decisions to produce and sell or consume nutritious crops, based on analysis of 80 in-depth interviews with women and men in three regions of Malawi. Respondents define all food crops as nutritious and marketable and emphasize maize-security over other more nutrient-dense food crops. The findings provide an in-depth understanding of diet patterns and preferences in the study population. It becomes clear that a sophisticated evaluation procedure guides household production, sale, and consumption decisions wherein a wide range of criteria are considered. In addition, insights emerge on the role of gendered structural domains in these decisions, dismissing a clear dichotomy of men's crops and women's crops and supporting a more nuanced and diverse view of these domains.

TI  - Immediate impact of COVID-19 pandemic on farming systems in Central America and Mexico
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - CONTEXT: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all sectors and human activities around the World. OBJECTIVE: In this article we present a first attempt to understand the immediate impact of COVID-19 and the sanitary measures taken by governments on farming systems in Central America and Mexico (CAM). M ETHODS: Through a review of information generated in these initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic (webinars, blogs, electronic publications, media) and 44 interviews with key informants across the region, we have identified the main impacts felt by different types of farming systems in the region. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: From corporate agricultural production systems, to small and medium scale entrepreneurs and smallholder subsistence farm households, all types of farming systems were impacted, more or less severely, by the different measures implemented by governments such as reduced mobility, closure of public and private venues and restrictions in borders. Larger corporate farming systems with vertical market integration and high level of control or coordination within the supply chain, and smallholder or subsistence farming systems with important focus on production for self-consumption and little external input use, were both relatively less impacted and showed greater adaptive capacity than the medium and small entrepreneurial farming systems dependent on agriculture as their primary income and with less control over the upstream and downstream parts of their supply chain. All types of farming systems implemented a series of mechanisms to cope with the COVID- 19 pandemic including the development of alternative value chains, food and agricultural products delivery systems and the exponential use of digital means to communicate and maintain the viability of the different agricultural systems. Collective action and organization of farmers also proved to be an important coping mechanism that allowed some farmers to acquire inputs and deliver outputs in the context of restricted mobility, price volatility, and general uncertainty. Some features of the CAM region played an important role in mediating the impact of COVID-19 and associated sanitary measures. We identify as particularly relevant the nature of agricultural exports, the current structure of the agricultural sector, the diversified livelihood strategies of rural households, and the importance of mobility for rural livelihoods. SIGNIFICANCE: The results presented focus only in the immediate effect of COVID-19 pandemic and the mechanisms implemented by farmers in the first months. Whether these impacts and response mechanisms will result in a transformation of the farming systems towards greater resilience and sustainability is still an open question.

TI  - Gendering post-harvest loss research: responsibilities of women and men to manage maize after harvest in southwestern Ethiopia
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Post-harvest losses are a significant problem worldwide, leading to a waste of resources when they are becoming scarcer. Rather than putting more energy into increasing production volume, addressing post-harvest losses can increase food availability without increasing yields. Using maize in Ethiopia to introduce gendering post-harvest loss research, we analyze the gendered division of labor in post-harvest management and then discuss implications. The study was conducted from 2014-2015 in southwestern Ethiopia as part of a broader research project from 2013-2018. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 208 male and female farmer heads of household. Our results show that although maize post-harvest activities are deemed to be the responsibility of women, the overall management of maize after harvest requires the cooperation of all household members. For example, both women and men contribute to time-sensitive harvest, packing and de-husking activities. Men tend to have the responsibility for ensuring that maize is stored well. Critically, women tend to sell small quantities of maize to pay for everyday household expenses including purchasing other foods to diversify diets. Often recommendations in literature to reduce maize post-harvest losses include building processing centers and formalizing the supply chain. However, as shown in this research, women's role to decide which maize to consume in the home and which to sell is important for access to quality food. Without gendering post-harvest loss research, it is possible that gender harms are enacted when women's livelihoods are impacted in the process of reducing post-harvest losses, and this may compromise food security.

TI  - Transformation of smallholder beef cattle production in Vietnam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This research describes and analyses how smallholder crop livestock farmers in rural Ea Kar, Vietnam, were able to take advantage of the rising demand for meat in urban centres and transform cattle production from a traditional, extensive grazing system to a more intensive, stall-fed system that supplied quality meat to urban markets. The traditional grazing system produced low-quality animals that could only be sold for local consumption. Introduction of the concept of farm-grown fodder production enabled farmers to produce fatter animals, achieving higher sale prices, and reduce labour inputs by moving from grazing to stall-feeding. These benefits convinced farmers, traders and local government that smallholder cattle production could be a viable enterprise and so stimulated stakeholder interest. Within 10 years, the way that cattle were produced and marketed changed considerably. By 2010, more than 3,000 smallholders had adopted farm-grown forages and stall-feeding, and many produced high-quality beef cattle. Traders had been able to develop access to urban markets as farmers were able to produce animals that satisfied the stringent quality requirements of urban markets. In addition to the underlying driver of strong market demand for quality meat, several factors contributed to this transition: (i) a convincing innovation - the use of farm-grown fodder - that provided immediate benefits to farmers and provided a vision for local stakeholders; (ii) a participatory, systems-oriented innovation process that emphasised capacity strengthening; (iii) a value chain approach that linked farmers and local traders to markets; (iv) the formation of a loosely structured coalition of local stakeholders that facilitated and managed the innovation process; and (v) technical support over a sufficiently long time period to allow innovation processes to become sustainable.

TI  - Social network analysis provides insights into African swine fever epidemiology
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - Pig movements play a significant role in the spread of economically important infectious diseases such as the African swine fever. Characterization of movement networks between pig farms and through other types of farm and household enterprises that are involved in pig value chains can provide useful information on the role that different participants in the networks play in pathogen transmission. Analysis of social networks that underpin these pig movements can reveal pathways that are important in the transmission of disease, trade in commodities, the dissemination of information and the influence of behavioural norms. We assessed pig movements among pig keeping households within West Kenya and East Uganda and across the shared Kenya Uganda border in the study region, to gain insight into within country and trans-boundary pig movements. Villages were sampled using a randomized cluster design. Data were collected through interviews in 2012 and 2013 from 683 smallholder pig-keeping households in 34 villages. NodeXL software was used to describe pig movement networks at village level. The pig movement and trade networks were localized and based on close social networks involving family ties, friendships and relationships with neighbours. Pig movement network modularity ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 and exhibited good community structure within the network implying an easy flow of knowledge and adoption of new attitudes and beliefs, but also promoting an enhanced rate of disease transmission. The average path length of 5 defined using NodeXL, indicated that disease could easily reach every node in a cluster. Cross-border boar service between Uganda and Kenya was also recorded. Unmonitored trade in both directions was prevalent. While most pig transactions in the absence of disease, were at a small scale (<5 km) and characterized by regular agistment, most pig sales during ASF outbreaks were to traders or other farmers from outside the sellers' village at a range of >10 km. The close social relationships between actors in pig movement networks indicate the potential for possible interventions to develop shared norms and mutually accepted protocols amongst smallholder pig keepers to better manage the risk of ASF introduction and transmission.

TI  - The Importance of Institutions in Mountainous Regions for Accessing Markets: An Example from the Moroccan High Atlas
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Like other mountainous regions in the world, the High Atlas suffers from a number of disadvantages, primarily related to its marginality, topographical fragmentation, and harsh environmental conditions. It is characterized by limited, fragile, and highly degraded natural resources, low incomes, and a high poverty level. People living in mountainous areas are among the poorest in the Near East and North Africa (IFAD 2002). The present study analyzed the importance of a cooperative-as one example of a rural institution-in facilitating smallholders' access to markets, its impact on the livelihood strategies of households, and the implications for poverty reduction. Communities in two valleys with similar bio-physical conditions in the Moroccan High Atlas, Taddarine and Anougal, were compared. Whereas Taddarine has a paved road but no marketing institution, Anougal features a dairy cooperative but does not have a paved road. Rapid rural appraisal methods and household surveys were used to gather data on livelihood assets and activities. The value chains of the main product in either valley-apples in Taddarine and milk in Anougal-were analyzed using market mapping methodology. In Anougal, with no paved road and no electricity, the milk collection center of the dairy cooperative has made dairy production the most important source of income for the farmers. In contrast, dairy production and marketing has not developed in Taddarine, which has a paved road and electricity but no dairy cooperative. The most important source of income,For these farmers is fruit production, with transport being facilitated by the paved road. The study shows that although road infrastructure in remote mountain communities is a necessary condition for market access, it is not sufficient. The development of local institutions-in this case a dairy cooperative-that facilitate market access by reducing marketing costs and opening up "economies of scale," is essential.

TI  - Feed-Based Multi-Mycotoxin Occurrence in Smallholder Dairy Farming Systems of South Africa: The Case of Limpopo and Free State
T2  - TOXINS
AB  - Mycotoxin contamination of feed does not only cut across food and feed value chains but compromises animal productivity and health, affecting farmers, traders and consumers alike. To aid in the development of a sustainable strategy for mycotoxin control in animal-based food production systems, this study focused on smallholder farming systems where 77 dairy cattle feed samples were collected from 28 smallholder dairy establishments in the Limpopo and Free State provinces of South Africa between 2018 and 2019. Samples were analyzed using a confirmatory UHPLC-MS/MS (Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) method validated for simultaneous detection of 23 mycotoxins in feeds. Overall, mycotoxins assessed were detected across samples with 86% of samples containing at least one mycotoxin above respective decision limits; up to 66% of samples were found to be contaminated with at least three mycotoxins. Findings demonstrated that deoxynivalenol, sterigmatocystin, alternariol and enniatin B were the most common mycotoxins, while low to marginal detection rates were observed for all other mycotoxins with none of the samples containing fusarenon-X, HT-2-toxin and neosolaniol. Isolated cases of deoxynivalenol (maximum: 2385 mu g/kg), aflatoxins (AFB(1) (maximum: 30.2 mu g/kg)/AFG(1) (maximum: 23.1 mu g/kg)), and zearalenone (maximum: 1793 mu g/kg) in excess of local and European regulatory limits were found. Kruskal-Wallis testing for pairwise comparisons showed commercial feed had significantly higher contamination for deoxynivalenol and its acylated derivatives, ochratoxin A and fumonisins (FB1 and FB2), whereas forages had significantly higher alternariol; in addition to significantly higher fumonisin B-1 contamination for Limpopo coupled with significantly higher enniatin B and sterigmatocystin for Free State. Statistically significant Spearman correlations (p < 0.01) were also apparent for ratios for deoxynivalenol/fumonisin B-1 (r(s) = 0.587) and zearalenone/alternariol methylether (r(s) = 0.544).

TI  - Circular bioeconomy in African food systems: What is the status quo? Insights from Rwanda, DRC, and Ethiopia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Increasing global food insecurity amidst a growing population and diminishing production resources renders the currently dominant linear production model insufficient to combat such challenges. Hence, a circular bioeconomy (CBE) model that ensures more conservative use of resources has become essential. Specifically, a CBE model that focuses on recycling and reusing organic waste is essential to close nutrient loops and establish more resilient rural-urban nexus food systems. However, the CBE status quo in many African food systems is not established. Moreover, scientific evidence on CBE in Africa is almost inexistent, thus limiting policy guidance to achieving circular food systems. Using a sample of about 2,100 farmers and consumers from key food value chains (cassava in Rwanda, coffee in DRC, and bananas in Ethiopia), we explored existing CBE practices; awareness, knowledge, and support for CBE practices; consumers' opinions on eating foods grown on processed organic waste (CBE fertilizers), and determinants of such opinions. We analysed data in Stata, first descriptively, and then econometrically using the ordered logistic regression, whose proportional odds assumption was violated, thus resorting to the generalized ordered logistic regression. Results show that communities practice aspects of CBE, mainly composting, and are broadly aware, knowledgeable, supportive of CBE practices, and would broadly accept eating foods grown CBE fertilizers. Households with heads that used mobile phones, or whose heads were older, or married, or had a better education and agricultural incomes were more likely to strongly agree that they were knowledgeable and supportive of CBE practices and would eat CBE foods (foods grown on processed organic waste). However, the reverse was true for households that were severely food insecure or lived farther from towns. Rwandan and Ethiopian households compared to DRC were less likely to eat CB foods. Policies to stimulate CBE investments in all three countries were largely absent, and quality scientific evidence to guide their development and implementation is currently insufficient.

TI  - Contract farming as partial insurance
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - A core result of contract theory is that contracts can help transfer risk from one party to another, the latter insuring the former. We test this prediction and explore the mechanism behind it in the context of contract farming, the economic institution wherein a processor contracts the production of a commodity to a grower. Specifically, we look at whether participation in contract farming is associated with lower levels of income variability in a sample of 1,200 households in Madagascar. Relying on a framed field experiment aimed at eliciting respondent marginal utility of participation in contract farming for identification in a selection-on-observables design, we find that participation in contract farming is associated with a 0.20-standard deviation decrease in income variability. Using mediation analysis to look at the mechanism behind this finding, we find support for the hypothesis that fixed-price contracts-which transfer all price risk from the grower to the processor-explain the reduction in income variability associated with contract farming. Because the assumption that makes our selection-on-observables design possible also satisfies the conditional independence assumption, we estimate propensity score matching and doubly robust weighted regression estimators, the results of which show that our core results are robust and that participation in contract farming would likely be more beneficial for those households that do not participate than for those who do. Our findings thus support the notion that, in a context where formal insurance markets fail, contracts can serve as partial insurance mechanisms. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Contribution of Small-Scale Acacia Hybrid Timber Production and Commercialization for Livelihood Development in Central Vietnam
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Forming a backbone of the wood supply in Vietnam, approximately 50% of plantation areas are managed by individual households. Of the planted species, the Acacia (Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex Benth. x Acacia mangium Willd) hybrid is one of the most preferred by timber growers. Yet, information on the potential of this timber species for rural livelihoods is lacking. Taking Nam Dong and Phu Loc districts in Thua Thien Hue province as case studies, this paper aimed to explore the (i) characteristics of small-scale Acacia hybrid timber producers; (ii) contribution of Acacia hybrid timber production and commercialization to rural livelihoods; and (iii) socio-economic and contextual factors which determine the income from Acacia hybrid timber. We applied a mixed-methods approach including review of secondary data, interviews of 26 key informants, eight focus group discussions, direct observations and a survey of 300 Acacia hybrid producer households selected through multistage and purposive sampling. Qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed using thematic, descriptive and inferential statistics, such as variance analysis, correlation analysis and Bayesian model average (BMA) analysis. The results demonstrated the diversity of socio-economic characteristics, resource access and management as well as determinants of timber income of small-scale timber producers between the cases. Accounting for 33-56% of total household income, Acacia hybrid timber plantations played a crucial role in the current livelihood system. Nevertheless, timber income was skewed toward the wealth status of timber producers and ranged between 327 USD/household and 3387 USD/household in Nam Dong and between 397 USD/household and 9460 USD/household in Phu Loc district. Despite the substantial contribution the income from Acacia hybrid plantations could make to local poverty reduction, it was the main contributor to the overall income inequality. While this income source reduced the Gini coefficient by 1% in Nam Dong, it increased the Gini coefficient by 18% in Phu Loc district. Our study can be of interest for further policy interventions focusing on sustainable reforestation and livelihood development in Vietnam.

TI  - Genetic resources management, seed production constraints and trade performance of orphan crops in Southern Africa: A case of Cowpea
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Despite the contribution of cowpeas to food security and the crop's numerous nutritional and health attributes, consumers in South Africa have labelled cowpeas, among other leguminous crops as a "poor people's food"; this contributed to the gradual decline in the cultivation and use of the crop. This, in turn, resulted in the observed high reliance on limited number of plant based protein crops and excessive consumption of livestock products. In this paper, three aspects are interrogated, i.e., genetic resource management, production constraints as well as the trade performance and consumption of cowpeas in South Africa. A clear understanding of these aspects renders an informed decision upon which recommendations for the necessary practical interventions that are needed to be put in place to spur the development of target products and cowpea's value chain. The assessment of genetic resource management and seed production constraints of cowpeas was based on a review of rele-vant literature, while descriptive analysis of secondary data spanning a period of 10 years (2010-2019) obtained from Trade Map and FAOSTAT databases was used to interrogate the trade performance and con-sumption of cowpeas. Findings reveal that seed production constraints are largely anchored on the limited attention government and policy making institutions have accorded to the seed system of orphaned crops, thereby compromising their potential by failing to supply affordable good quality seeds to smallholder and commercial farmers. However, South Africa has one of the largest and most diverse collections of cowpea germplasm housed at the Agricultural Research Council. With regard to trade performance and consumption, results show that South Africa is a net exporter of cowpeas, with a 10 years' period annual average worth R2.9 million. Given that South Africa does not re-export cowpeas, yet on average 4848 tonnes are produced annually, it is a clear indication that the country produces lightly more than what is consumed domestically -on average 4634 tonnes per annum. Therefore, recommendation is made to bolster cowpea production and productivity through mainstreaming the legume seed system towards boosting local and export markets as well as strongly enhancing local consumption by creating awareness of the nutritional and health benefits of cowpeas. Furthermore, there isa need to increase awareness about the nutritional and health benefits of cow-peas and other leguminous crops, among other socio-economic benefits. This is important in spurring cowpeas consumption domestically, while countering the over reliance on animal products as protein sources and the associated risks such as such as high greenhouse gas emissions and obesity for people.

TI  - Spatialising the Melanesian Canarium industry: Understanding economic upgrading in an emerging industry among three Pacific small island states
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - This paper examines economic upgrading in the Canarium indicum (Canarium) nut industry in Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. Canarium is a tree that is indigenous to Melanesia, and has been the subject of several commercialisation attempts since 1988. The paper assesses the outcomes to various actors in the Canarium supply chain from attempts to upgrade industry products and processes by: (1) increasing the available resource in suitable locations; (2) improving nut products and processing techniques; (3) increasing actors' knowledge and supply chain coordination; and (4) establishing product standards. A two-phase data generation process was implemented. Document analysis and participant observations of industry workshops initiated a set of four economic upgrading interventions that were adaptively implemented. A second stage of workshops and 76 interviews enabled outcomes to be assessed at the project's end. Findings suggest that a small number of urban-based entrepreneurs benefit and subsequently are lead actors in industry development, but at the expense of benefits being distributed to a larger, more spatially disparate group of smallholder and small commercial growers. These economic upgrading outcomes are circumscribed by core-periphery relations in Pacific small island states and the scale of industry in each country. Thus, spatial inequalities are reproduced through the emerging Canarium industries. We argue that different routes to industry development are required in each country. Development initiatives that capitalise on the benefits of micro-enterprise clusters, joint action and regional institutional arrangements are proposed to overcome the impediments imposed by the particular geographies of Pacific island states.

TI  - The clove tree and its products (clove bud, clove oil, eugenol): prosperous today but what of tomorrow's restrictions?
T2  - FRUITS
AB  - Context of the study - The clove tree, farmed primarily in Indonesia, Madagascar, the Comoros, Tanzania and Sri Lanka, produces two major commodities: the clove and the eugenol-rich essential oil. At the present time, the clove caters to the spice market, which is concentrated in India, as well as the market for the traditional Indonesian cigarette, the kretek, which accounts for 70% of world output. The essential oil extract is exploited for its various properties: plasticising, anaesthetic, antimicrobial and organoleptic, which are deployed in the cosmetics, dentistry and agro-food sectors. Several innovative, often cutting edge, applications are currently being researched, taking advantage of its profile as an organic product derived from green chemistry, implicated in the agroecology approach. The main areas concerned are medicine, agri-food and agronomy. Aim of the study - We are considering a series of plausible hypotheses of evolutions in demand on the international market, to assess how the development of current and potential applications might steer the market in the coming years and decades. We are exploring their impact on the offer of producing countries, and therefore, on the incomes of local farmers and distillers. Methodology - Our approach is based on an extensive bibliography. Remarkable results - The clove sector is under threat from various sources: American cigarette manufacturers' offensive to conquer the vast Indonesian market, disregard for quality, inter-annual variation of production, competition between clove producing countries, as well as substitute products, impact of oil extraction methods on firewood consumption. A few forward-looking elements are given, particularly concerning the impact of climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion - These threats need to be anticipated and taken into consideration by all actors of the sectors for the clove and its products to continue providing a reliable source of income to thousands of small farmers in the producing countries.

TI  - COVID-19 lockdown and the forestry sector: Insight from Gandaki province of Nepal
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Almost all countries have imposed large-scale mobility restrictions (or lockdown) to stop the spreading of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The mobility restriction has disrupted all types of business; causing a devastating impact on countries' economies; and pushing millions of people into extreme poverty. Scientists have been assessing the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on various fronts but there is limited scholarship in the forestry sector. We navigated the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the forestry sector by taking Gandaki Province (21,974 km2) of Nepal as a case. Employing semi-structured interviews (n = 62) with all ten stakeholder groups, literature review and media analysis, our study revealed that the COVID-19 lockdown suspended all types of forestry and ecotourism businesses; obstructed research and monitoring activities; halted capacity development and extension services; impacted forest development work; and increased incidences of illegal logging and poaching and trafficking of wildlife. Because of the complete shutdown of businesses, the forestry sector of Gandaki province lost 9.6 million USD and 3.2 million man-days of employment during the lockdown period. The economic cost of the lockdown was 1.73 million USD for NTFPs traders, 1.26 million USD for ecotourism entrepreneurs, 0.55 million USD for the community forest user groups and 0.24 million USD for the smallholder or private forest owner. We suggested four post-COVID recovery pathways, including sustainable forest management, nature-based tourism, improvement of forest products value chain and community-based natural resource management to bounce back from the loss. As the current pandemic is most likely to derail the Sustainable Development Pathways of several countries, including Nepal and necessitates the need for an immediate response, the finding and recommendation of our study may inform decision-makers to reimage post-pandemic recovery and leverage sustainable development.

TI  - Unmasking partnerships for agricultural innovation: the realities of a research-private sector partnership in Lombok, Indonesia
T2  - INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Research institute-private sector partnerships are promoted as a mechanism to increase the scale and sustainability of research impact, especially where government extension services are constrained. Such partnerships are often framed as simple transactional or contractual arrangements. This paper traces the evolution of a multi-lateral partnership between a public university, agri-input supplier, finance provider and local government in North and East Lombok. The partnership aimed to increase household incomes by introducing new practices for maize and pulse production, but in order to do so, had to enable farmers to access affordable credit and inputs in a timely manner. Analysis of the partnership over three years highlights its dynamic nature and the importance of a consistent champion who aligns the competing institutional incentives and aspirations of actors. It also highlights how partners bear different types and degrees of risk across different stages of the partnership. The findings affirm the potential for research-private sector partnerships to contribute to agricultural innovation but highlight a more complex and messy process than is acknowledged in the literature. A more realistic understanding of partnership and innovation processes needs to inform how schemes and innovation support mechanisms are designed if they are to deliver on the promise of scale and sustainability.

TI  - Food security and food quality among vanilla farmers in Madagascar: the role of contract farming and livestock keeping
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - The northeastern SAVA region of Madagascar is the largest vanilla producing area in the world and is flourishing due to a large global demand for natural vanilla. Although the general socio-economic situation has regionally improved because of high vanilla prices, little is known about the nutritional status of local vanilla farmers. We used a 12-month longitudinal food survey to analyze food security, food consumption and nutrient intake of local vanilla farming households (n = 140). Food consumption data was complemented with baseline, agro-economic, longitudinal and field-plot information to determine factors influencing food security, and the contribution of protein from Animal Source Food (ASF_protein) to household nutrition using a stepwise generalized linear model. Results show a high level (74%) of food insecurity and micronutrient deficiency but an acceptable level of protein intake among surveyed households. Consumption of rice, the principal source of carbohydrates, is stable across the year. Compared to other regions in Madagascar, local diets are moderately diversified with an acceptable share of ASF_protein (about 50%). Household size (P < 0.001) and cash income from rice sales (P < 0.001) were the most important factors influencing the food security index (FSI), while cash crop income (P < 0.01) and number of income sources (P < 0.01) were more important in the explanation of the dietary share of ASF_protein. Yet, neither livestock ownership nor contracting with vanilla buyers/exporters did improve food security of the surveyed households. Households who concluded contracts were significantly less food secure than non-contracting households (P = 0.01) with seasonal fluctuations across the year. Policy implications of our findings are that, although many actors of the vanilla value chain run social and environmental programs in the SAVA region, more needs to be done to improve diet quality at household level and strengthen farmers' resilience to food insecurity.

TI  - Farmers' knowledge, perception, and use of phosphorus fertilization for cowpea production in Northern Guinea Savannah of Nigeria
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp) is an important legume crop, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Poor soil fertility is among the major abiotic factors that contribute to this crop's low yield. Phosphorus (P)-based fertilizers significantly increase cowpea yields but these fertilizers are not well adopted by smallholder cowpea farmers. To understand why, we surveyed 420 farmers across three major cowpea-producing states in Nigeria: first, we assessed the cowpea farmers' knowledge and perception of the need for fertilizers, especially P fertilizers; and, second, we identified factors that determine the use - or non-use - of P-based fertilizers. Although over 80% of farmers surveyed were aware of the value of fertilizers as a yield-increasing factor and were able to identify crops suffering from nutrient deficiency, only 10% used P-based fertilizers like single super phosphate (SSP) and another 11% used combinations of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium compound fertilizers and SSP for cowpeas. Reasons for not using P-containing fertilizers included high cost, poor availability in rural markets, and lack of awareness on the need to use P fertilizers. Additionally, many growers believed that cowpeas do not require fertilizers, especially if the previous crop had been maize. Our findings are important for strategies to increase the productivity of cowpeas among smallholder growers especially in the northern regions of Nigeria and beyond, where subsistence farming systems are prevalent. Increased cowpea production through the adequate use of inputs like P fertilizers will support Nigeria's effort to reduce its large imports of cowpea grain from neighboring countries. Our survey further demonstrated that P-containing fertilizers are crucial production inputs for increased cowpea production in these regions and in areas with similar traditional farming practices. Our results will benefit breeders, development partners, extension personnel, and other stakeholders in cowpea value chains.

TI  - The economic feasibility of Jatropha cultivation for biodiesel production in Rwanda: A case study of Kirehe district
T2  - ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Rwandan dependence on imported petroleum products led to the exploration of the possibility of using biodiesel. To obtain feedstock, local farmers across the country were encouraged to grow Jatropha curcas L for biodiesel production project. This study investigated the economic feasibility of small-scale Jatropha farming for biodiesel production in Kirehe district, Eastern Province. In assessing the economic feasibility, both primary and secondary data were used. Primary data were collected from a total of 73 small-scale Jatropha farmers in five selected sectors in Kirehe district as well as from interviews with key players of biodiesel project. By using Net Present Value (NPV) and Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) as cost-benefit indicators, it was found that currently Jatropha cultivation is not economically feasible. This is due to very low seed yields, low Jatropha seed price, high discount rate and high production cost. Sensitivity analysis indicated that Jatropha cultivation is economically viable when seed yield is greater than 7000 kg/ha/year (with NPV greater than 1,184,414 Rwf/ha) and seed market price is greater than 240 RwI/kg (with NPV greater than 88,172 Rwf/ha). In addition, it was found that if Jatropha is grown as fences (which require less inputs and labour), the venture is profitable with NPV of 821,500 Rwf/ha. However, substantial amount of revenue (2,081,924 Rwf/ha) is generated when hired labour is replaced by family labour. Based on the findings from this study, it is recommended that currently small-scale farmers should grow Jatropha as fences around their farms or alongside roads due to significantly low investment risks and opportunity costs for land. However, higher profit will be realized from Jatropha grown as fences if alternative uses of seeds will be developed by various actors along the value chain. (C) 2019 International Energy Initiative.

TI  - Circular bioeconomy in African food systems: What is the status quo? Insights from Rwanda, DRC, and Ethiopia
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Increasing global food insecurity amidst a growing population and diminishing production resources renders the currently dominant linear production model insufficient to combat such challenges. Hence, a circular bioeconomy (CBE) model that ensures more conservative use of resources has become essential. Specifically, a CBE model that focuses on recycling and reusing organic waste is essential to close nutrient loops and establish more resilient rural-urban nexus food systems. However, the CBE status quo in many African food systems is not established. Moreover, scientific evidence on CBE in Africa is almost inexistent, thus limiting policy guidance to achieving circular food systems. Using a sample of about 2,100 farmers and consumers from key food value chains (cassava in Rwanda, coffee in DRC, and bananas in Ethiopia), we explored existing CBE practices; awareness, knowledge, and support for CBE practices; consumers' opinions on eating foods grown on processed organic waste (CBE fertilizers), and determinants of such opinions. We analysed data in Stata, first descriptively, and then econometrically using the ordered logistic regression, whose proportional odds assumption was violated, thus resorting to the generalized ordered logistic regression. Results show that communities practice aspects of CBE, mainly composting, and are broadly aware, knowledgeable, supportive of CBE practices, and would broadly accept eating foods grown CBE fertilizers. Households with heads that used mobile phones, or whose heads were older, or married, or had a better education and agricultural incomes were more likely to strongly agree that they were knowledgeable and supportive of CBE practices and would eat CBE foods (foods grown on processed organic waste). However, the reverse was true for households that were severely food insecure or lived farther from towns. Rwandan and Ethiopian households compared to DRC were less likely to eat CB foods. Policies to stimulate CBE investments in all three countries were largely absent, and quality scientific evidence to guide their development and implementation is currently insufficient.

TI  - Effect of genetic European taurine ancestry on milk yield of Ankole-Holstein crossbred dairy cattle in mixed smallholders system of Burundi highlands
T2  - ANIMAL GENETICS
AB  - Different breeding systems associated with specific bovine genetic resources have coexisted in Burundi. To prepare for the development of a national action plan for the improvement of bovine genetic resources in Burundi, we aimed at performing genetic characterization of Ankole and Ankole x European crossbred individuals and assessing the effect of European ancestry on milk productivity of cows kept under the mixed crops livestock system. To that end, we genotyped 37 Ankole and 138 crossbred individuals on 42 636 SNPs and combined these genotypes with those from 21 cattle breeds, representative of the bovine genetic diversity. We also measured milk yield not suckled and estimated suckled milk. Given the results, we confirmed the indicine x African taurine admixed origin of the Ankole in Burundi and showed that crossbred individuals present a high proportion of European ancestry (i.e. 57% on average). As the proportion of European ancestry increased, milk yield increased by 0.03 +/- 0.01 l/day, at a lower extent than expected. We also observed that breeders were unable to correctly evaluate the European proportion in their livestock. Our results may provide useful information for objective dairy breeding in Burundi. As an example, an ex-situ conservation program of Ankole within the framework of value chains is proposed as an accompanying strategy to improve the sustainability of the crossbreeding program.

TI  - Nucleus-outgrower schemes as an alternative to traditional smallholder agriculture in Tanzania - strengths, weaknesses and policy requirements
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - The public debate about the right type of agriculture for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) often constructs a dichotomy between smallholders and large-scale agriculture. This over-simplification ignores some important intermediary forms for organising agriculture, including nucleus-outgrower schemes (NOSs). NOSs promise to combine the benefits of both while potentially reducing, though not avoiding, (part of) their drawbacks. This article analyses the conditions under which NOSs are feasible and beneficial for investors, outgrowers and rural development for selected value chains in Tanzania. It is based on an empirical study comprising 276 qualitative interviews with various stakeholders conducted in central Tanzania in spring 2015 on 10 NOSs in three subsectors (rice, sugar cane and tea) in different stages of realisation (planning, establishment, full production and failure or near-failure). The study examines why investments succeed or fail in different stages, the socio-economic impacts and various policies important for their fate. Findings show that there are many challenges to successfully implementing NOSs in Tanzania, including national policies on the business environment, on agriculture in general and on specific subsectors, and, especially, on land issues. Nevertheless, these schemes seem to have considerable potential to support local development, particularly by providing employment and salaries, incomes for outgrower farmers, infrastructure and corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects as compensation for loss of access to land for the community. The specific details of a particular business model influence the opportunities and risks, but no single model seems to be superior; much depends on the subsector structure and the services already available. In general, policies to attract and steer NOSs in Tanzania are not yet sufficiently developed, coordinated or implemented.

TI  - The curious case of C-88: impacts of a potato variety on farmers in Yunnan, China
T2  - CABI AGRICULTURE & BIOSCIENCE
AB  - BackgroundLimited analysis has been conducted of the role of agricultural research in promoting Chinese agricultural growth in less-favored areas. This paper analyzes how a particular potato variety generates benefits to producers and discusses how these benefits may have contributed to poverty reduction in Yunnan province. Cooperation 88 (C88) is a high-yielding, late blight-resistant variety that was developed through a partnership between the International Potato Center and Yunnan Normal University in Kunming, China.MethodsQualitative and quantitative methods are used to analyze determinants of adoption of C88, and to estimate impacts of adoption on producer well-being. A unique farm-household database is used to document the determinants of C88 adoption and disadoption. The quantitative assessment is supplemented with a qualitative analysis of the potato value chain to understand how seed availability and concern for processing attributes contributed to and eventually constrained diffusion. Market-level information was used in an economic surplus model to quantify the substantial economic impact of C88 over 20 years since its release.ResultsC88 spread rapidly in Yunnan following its release and was widely adopted by commercially oriented farmers. Disadoption began after 2010 with limited seed availability driving the shift toward newer varieties. Farmers, however, appreciate the ease of marketing, the 15% higher yields, and late-blight resistance associated with C88 suggesting that seed constraints are countervailing the economic benefits of the variety. Total impact on Yunnan potato farmers of the variety was estimated to be around $2.5 billion for the 1996-2015 period.ConclusionsOn per-person terms among C88 growing farm households, the economic advantage of the variety is likely to have contributed to poverty reduction. The aggregate impact of C88 diffusion occurred during a period of rapid poverty reduction in Yunnan and yield and disease-resistance benefits of C88 likely contributed to this reduction.

TI  - Wild foods from forests: Quantities collected across Zambia
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
AB  - Forests provide an immense range of benefits to people, many of which are not prioritized by forest policy because they are difficult to quantify. Wild foods from forests enhance the quality of diets for those who consume them and provide income for those who sell or trade them. The quantity of wild food collected is challenging to measure because of non-standard units, seasonal differences in collection patterns and large numbers of species. To provide initial estimates of collection volume in Zambia and pilot new methods, we surveyed 209 households across 14 villages randomly selected within 5 study areas covering all four agro-ecological areas between 6 August and 27 October, 2019. For each study area, we conducted a focus group to identify the most commonly collected species within each of nine food product types (mushrooms, insects, green leafy vegetables, tubers, fruits, nuts, wild meat, wild fish, and aquatic plants). All but one surveyed household collected some wild foods; on average, each household collected five types of food product, most commonly mushrooms, fruits and green leafy vegetables. Volume collected varied markedly by household, product type and study area. Rural households in Zambia are estimated to collect over 380 million litres, 380,000 m(3), of wild foods annually. We estimate that 88% of these wild foods are collected directly from forests. Accounting for uncertainties, we estimate the volume of wild foods collected from forests to be at least 238,000 m(3) per year, 125% of the volume of sawnwood produced, or about 12 million large (20 L) collecting buckets. Volume collected was not strongly correlated with metrics of wealth, indicating ubiquitous consumption of wild foods; however, the most food insecure collected particularly high volumes of wild food. Pilot market surveys found local value chains for wild foods, indicating a potential for economic contribution. Our results underscore the value of data that can be disaggregated locally and indicate that national estimates of quantities of wild food collected from forests would be highly useful for designing forest policy and management strategies.

TI  - The role of cooperative business models for the success of smallholder coffee certification in Nicaragua: A comparison of conventional, organic and Organic-Fairtrade certified cooperatives
T2  - RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Supported by policy-makers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), coffee farmer organizations obtain organic and Fairtrade certifications to upgrade their coffee and, thus, increase returns to their members. Whether this and other upgrading strategies fit into the business model of the cooperative and lead to success are often not considered. This research aims to identify similarities and differences between conventional and certified cooperatives and the resultant impact on farmers' incomes. We analyze the business models, upgrading strategies, and strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of seven conventional, organic and Organic-Fairtrade certified coffee cooperatives and link these to members' coffee gross margins. We use data from over 100 in-depth qualitative interviews and a household survey of 327 cooperative members in northern Nicaragua. Results indicate that cooperatives often apply the same upgrading strategies despite very different business models and SWOT. There are also many commonalities of SWOT among cooperatives but no clear-cut differences between conventional, organic and Organic-Fairtrade certified cooperatives. The qualitative comparison of coffee gross margins among the cooperatives shows no clear income effect from participating in certified coffee production and certified cooperatives. It indicates, rather, dependence of gross margins on yield levels, the business model and upgrading strategies of the cooperatives. Upgrading through certification seems only successful with a suitable business model and other upgrading strategies. Policies should focus on (i) increasing as well as stabilizing coffee yields, and (ii) on the institutional framework of cooperatives by offering strategic support, credit access, external auditing of cooperatives and the establishment of a functional national coffee institute.

TI  - Assessment of biosecurity practices of small-scale broiler producers in central Egypt
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - In the current situation of endemicity of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Egypt, improving the biosecurity of poultry production has become essential to the progressive reduction the incidence of the disease. A significant proportion of the Egyptian commercial poultry system consists of small-scale poultry producers operating with low to minimal biosecurity measures. An investigation was conducted into the level of adoption of standard biosecurity measures of the small-scale commercial chicken growers, including both farm- and home-based commercial production, input suppliers and other actors along the meat chicken value chain in Fayoum, Egypt. The study which used direct observations and group discussions of nearly 160 participants and structured interviews with 463 respondents, assessed biosecurity implementation to improve management practices and ultimately to control and prevent highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). The survey found that overall, biosecurity measures are rarely implemented in small-scale commercial poultry production units. Compliance with recommended biosecurity practices did not greatly vary from home-based to farm-based commercial production. Furthermore, serious risk practices were identified, such as unsafe disposal of poultry carcasses and potential disease spread posed by poor biosecurity measures implemented during vaccination. HPAI control measures have been ineffective due to limited cooperation between public and private sector, aggravated by the unpopular measures taken in the event of outbreaks and no compensation paid for incurred losses. Outreach and biosecurity awareness raising initiatives should be specifically developed for small-scale producers with the objective of improving general poultry management and thus preventing HPAI and other poultry diseases.

TI  - Addressing the resilience of tomato farmers in Ghana facing a double exposure from climate and market
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Ghanaian tomato farmers are severely impacted by changing climate and related more frequent and extreme weather events such as drought and heavy rainfall. Furthermore, tomato production represents one of the main sources of income for these farmers, which leaves them highly exposed to market price variations. However, the full impact of changing climate and price variations for these farmers has not been assessed. Here, we examined how Ghanaian tomato farmers experience and respond to a double exposure from climate and market related shocks. The objectives were threefold: (i) to investigate how farmers in two different agroecological zones (savannah and semi-equatorial) experience climate and market shocks, (ii) to examine the major response strategies implemented in face of this double exposure, and (iii) to identify paths toward systemic changes to enhance resilience. A survey was conducted with 344 tomato smallholder farmers in the two agroecological zones. The results from the survey were complemented by semi-structured interviews and focus groups. We found that farmers are severely exposed to climate and market shocks, which causes a reduction in both production activities and revenues. A set of agricultural and water management practices, such as crop rotation, supplementary fertilization, and water tanks, have been adopted by farmers as response mechanisms to climate variations. However, no response mechanisms, other than agricultural diversification, are in place yet to face the economic shocks. Thus, enhancing systemic resilience becomes particularly important to face this double exposure and restructure and change feedback mechanisms within the current system. The reestablishment of tomato processing plants or formalizing the stakeholders' network could both be ways to integrate value-chain stakeholders and support appropriate structures. Encompassing both climate and trading attributes through specific agro-food policies are much-needed for a sustainable and resilient transformation of the tomato production system.

TI  - Moving Up or Moving Out? Insights into Rural Development and Poverty Reduction in Senegal
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - While worldwide progress in poverty reduction has been impressive, Sub-Saharan Africa is lagging behind with slow growth and a high-poverty headcount ratio. There are fierce debates on how Sub-Saharan Africa can foster pro-poor growth and the role of agriculture and small- versus large-scale farming in poverty reduction. We contribute to this debate with micro-economic empirical evidence from the Senegal River Delta, an area that recently experienced rapid rural development. We use household survey data from two panel rounds in 2006 and 2013 and a cluster analysis to investigate livelihood, income, and poverty dynamics in the region. We find that with 4.3% annual growth in average household income, 29.5 percentage points' poverty reduction, and 4.2 percentage points' inequality reduction over the period 2006-13, development in the Senegal River Delta region has been remarkably pro-poor. Income growth and poverty reduction have been most impressive among households moving into wage employment on large-scale horticultural export farms and in an emerging service sector. Income growth in small-scale agriculture and non-farm businesses has been more modest but has affected the largest number of households. Transformation in both farm and non-farm sectors has driven rural development in the Senegal River Delta region, and investments in both large- and small-scale agriculture have contributed importantly to household income growth and poverty reduction. Our findings imply that (foreign) investments in large-scale commercial and export-oriented farming can trigger pro-poor growth directly through employment effects and indirectly through investment and consumption linkages with the small-scale farm and non-farm sector.

TI  - Assessing actors in rural markets of sheep and goats in the Nyando Basin of Western Kenya: a key to improving productivity from smallholder farms
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - Livestock traders are a key conduit for incentives in livestock production systems. Their actions affect producer prices, investment decisions, and their livelihoods. However, smallholder farmers in rural communities of eastern Africa often have limited understanding of the marketing process and the interactions among market actors. This study was undertaken following the introduction of improved indigenous goat and sheep breeds in Climate Smart Villages of Nyando in western Kenya. We sought to understand the marketing of sheep and goats in five key rural markets used by the smallholder farmers of Nyando, to generate information on key market actors, their functions in the value chain, and their preferences for attributes in sheep and goats. Most traders (65%) in all the markets were men. Four different types of traders operated in the markets, producers, retailers, wholesalers, and brokers, each making a profit. Preference for selling sheep or goats and the animal attributes desired by the traders differed depending on the surrounding community. Markets in Kericho County of Nyando traded more goats than sheep while those in Kisumu County of Nyando traded more sheep than goats. There were no clear policies guiding pricing of animals. Prices offered to producers depended on previous days, and the number of animals available for sale at the marketing point. The collaborative group actions of the producers in the Climate Smart Villages did not extend beyond the level of production to the marketing of their livestock. A critical change is required for the smallholder farmers to derive better incomes from improved quality of animals following adoption of improved breeding and management practices. The results illustrate the need to engage rural market actors when implementing livestock improvement programs for smallholder farmers for better farm gate prices of animals, and thus achieve the improved incomes envisioned.

TI  - Farmers' Preferred Genotype Traits and Socio-Economic Factors Influencing the Adoption of Improved Cowpea Varieties in South-Central Niger
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Cowpea, Vigna unguiculata (L.) (Walpers, 1842), is an important legume for food and nutrition security, and income generation. Despite decade-long efforts to disseminate improved varieties, cowpea productivity remains low in Niger. This is due, in part, to the limited adoption of improved cowpea varieties among farmers. Increasing the adoption of improved cowpea varieties requires a better understanding of farmers' preferred genotype traits and socio-economic factors that influence their decision. We interviewed 634 farmers from the south-central regions (Maradi and Zinder) of Niger to assess factors that influence their decision to adopt improved cowpea varieties. The average age of the respondent was 41 years with 29 years of farming experience. Eight improved cowpea varieties were grown by these farmers with average adoption rates ranging from 3.3 to 38.0%. Genotype traits that influenced farmers' decision to adopt improved cowpea varieties included early maturing (86.9%), high yielding (73.9%), and high market value (50.5%). Socio-economic factors that significantly influenced adoption were age, gender, membership in a farmers' organization, and contact with the extension services. Adoption is constrained by the limited availability of cowpea varieties with farmers' preferred genotypes traits. Farmers' preferences for genotype traits must be considered in the early stages of breeding programs and the release of new varieties to increase adoption. Stakeholders involved in the cowpea value chain can use this information to improve cowpea adoption and productivity.

TI  - Magnitude of investment and global value chain: a case study of textile and clothing industry of Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE
AB  - The objective of this study is to assess the impact of value addition chain and investment size on the sales revenue of export-oriented firms in Pakistan. Pakistan is severely facing the economic crisis because of its declining exports and growing external debt. The manufacturing of the intermediate products - yarn and fabric - belong to the capital-intensive industries. The large part of these products is exported to USA, China, European Union and Bangladesh. The importing partners convert these intermediate products into finished goods (garments, home textile, towel, etc.). Similarly, the finished goods which are produced by Pakistani companies and exported directly by the producers or small-scale brokerage houses do not have Pakistani brand names. The clothing sector companies in European Union and USA sale these products in super stores and retail shops under their brand names. This mechanism explains the distribution of benefits through the global value addition chain in textile and clothing industry. It is hypothesized in this study that sale revenues of textile manufacturing companies ares determined by the size of investment, type of products (stage of the integration), average lending rates, exchange rate in term of rupees per US dollar and the market access. Data for this analysis was extracted from the Annual Reports of the companies listed on Pakistan Stock Exchange. The data consists of 248 companies and 14 years (from 2003 to 2016). Through this panel data we quantified the impacts of the size of investment and the stage of value addition in textile chain on sales revenue. It is concluded that size of a company is a serious matter, while the total assets lead further increase in the sales revenue, however the negative sign with significant and robust parameters attached with the composite variable of the large companies' category and value of its total assets reflects the decreasing rate of return on additional investment in large-scale companies. The devaluation of Pakistani currency has been positively affecting the sales of exporting sector companies. However, the lending rate of interest has not shown a significant impact.

TI  - Supporting participatory livestock feed improvement using the Feed Assessment Tool (FEAST)
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Livestock production is central to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries, but livestock are often poorly fed which limits their potential for reducing poverty. Efforts to improve livestock nutrition are often driven by supply-push thinking and fail to engage meaningfully with farmers and the realities they face. The Feed Assessment Tool (FEAST) was developed as a way of involving farmers more closely in decision making on livestock feed improvement. FEAST is a participatory tool which uses focus group discussions and individual farmer interviews to develop a broad overview of the livestock farming system. FEAST has been applied in many countries in the last 10 years. Examples of intensive use come from the Accelerated Value Chain Development Project in Kenya and the Rwanda Dairy Development Project in Rwanda. In both cases the tool was used to inform feed options with strong input from farmers. Although the primary purpose of FEAST is to support improved feed strategies at farm level, the data collected through the FEAST app and published in FEAST reports are a rich information resource that can be useful for developing broader system-level understanding of livestock feed issues. FEAST data can be uploaded into a global data repository where they are available for researchers. These data are also used to generate visualizations of key feed metrics further extending the use of secondary data. FEAST is an example of a participatory tool that moves decision making in the direction of farmers, while providing insights to researchers working across farming systems. Its widespread use across many countries is an indication that it fills a gap in in the livestock feed development space. Its novelty lies in bridging the knowledge gap (both ways) between livestock researchers and small-scale livestock keepers.

TI  - Characteristics and trait preferences of West African Dwarf goat keepers in Ghana
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the characteristics of West African Dwarf (WAD) goat keepers and their trait preferences as part of a broader phenotypic characterisation work with the aim of providing information for improving the household management, conservation and productivity of the breed in Ghana. A total of 384 respondent households were selected from four agro-ecological zones in the middle belt and southern part of the country for questionnaire administration and direct observation of animals under field conditions. The results showed that there are slightly more women (54.2%) keeping WAD goats than men (45.8%) and fall within the economically active population of youthful and middle age categories (53.9%). A majority of these goat keepers were married (73.8%) and educated (87.3%) in one way or the other. They obtained their starter or foundation stock mainly from neighbours (80.5%) and the open market (16.0%). The average flock size from the households sampled was 7.9 +/- 1.5, whereas the flock structure constituted 56.1% adult females, 27.5% adult intact males, 1.2% castrates and 15.2% kids of both sexes. Survivability, fast growth rate and larger litter size were the farmers' most preferred quantitative traits, whereas most of these respondents preferred to keep WAD goats which do not have qualitative traits such as horn, wattle and beard. From the findings of the research, it was concluded that the favourable socio-economic characteristics of WAD goat keepers could sustain intensification and increase the productivity of the breed when given the necessary input assistance along the goat value chain. The primary objective of WAD goat farmers is to produce matured animals for various purposes and the breeding goal for a WAD goat breeding programme would be to increase survival, growth rate and litter size of light coat (white, grey and light brown) goats. Finally, most farmers lack knowledge on the significance of tropically beneficial qualitative traits such as horn, wattle, beard and light coat colouration on the survivability, climate adaptability or resilience and productivity of their goats. Educating farmers on the importance of conserving and inclusion of animals possessing such traits in their selection practices under the Government's Rearing for Food and Jobs Initiative is therefore suggested.

TI  - Transdisciplinary processes of developing, applying, and evaluating a method for improving smallholder farmers' access to (phosphorus) fertilizers: the SMAP method
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB  - The lack of knowledge about fertilization, inadequate income to purchase fertilizers, limited access to the right type of fertilizers, and national policies have been identified as prerequisites of Sub-Saharan smallholder farmers' low yield and food insecurity. This paper presents how the smallholder access to phosphorus (SMAP) method was developed in a transdisciplinary process in Kenya, and what insights have been gained in a first application of the SMAP method. The transdisciplinary SMAP method comprises (1) farmers' participation in a transdisciplinary process including extension officers and local scientists to construct farm-specific fertilization strategies based on (2) farm-specific soil testing and (3) the construction of cooperative strategies for purchasing fertilizers involving farmers, traders, and financial institutions in a timely manner. The method aims to improve farmers' participation in the value chain. The development of the method followed the Zurich 2000 conception of transdisciplinarity. The development co-led by representatives of a cereal growers association and scientists from local and international universities included main actors of the national and local (phosphorus) fertilizer supply-demand chain. The first application of the SMAP method was evaluated by embedding an ANOVA (analysis of variance) study design following the ideas of experimental action research. There were significant effects of soil testing and a marginal significant effect of the transdisciplinary construction of farm-specific fertilization strategies. This paper presents the initial transdisciplinary project plan for developing the SMAP method, how the transdisciplinary process worked in reality, what obstacles were met in practice, and the benefits of practice and science that resulted from this transdisciplinary project.

TI  - Towards better-informed consent: Research with livestock-keepers and informal traders in East Africa
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB  - With the rise of the One Health paradigm, ethicists have called for new research approaches, considering the interdependent relationships of humans, animals, and their environment. These relationships can be particularly complex within resource-poor, smallholder livestock systems, necessitating a rigorous informed-consent process. Little has been published on informed consent beyond human-subject research. This paper outlines two studies on informed consent, for research identifying diseases of animal and human importance, within smallholder livestock value chains. Firstly, a randomized independent-group study compared three communication tools (written, cartoons, and photographs) for informing 22 Tanzanian livestock-keepers before seeking their consent. A significant difference in comprehension and engagement in the informed-consent process was found between tools, and cartoons had the highest (i.e. best combined comprehension and engagement) scores. Most (21 out of 22) farmers answered half or more the questions correctly, but none were able to answer all questions. Comprehension testing allowed identification of common misunderstandings, such as immediate benefits the farmers would receive and the process to be used for relaying research results. Dialogue stimulated by cartoons and photographs allowed researchers to determine and respond to participants' varied relationships with their livestock. The second study assessed preferred methods for indicating consent among informal-sector milk vendors in Nairobi, Kenya. Of consenting participants, 61% (140/230) indicated consent verbally, 39%(90/230) signed consent and none chose thumbprint. There was a significant enumerator-effect on both overall consent and the methods chosen. Several of these findings echo those published in human-medical research. Additionally, highlighted here is the importance of facilitating dialogue during the informed-consent process in One Health research, for a more nuanced understanding of relationships between humans, animals, and their environment. Also discussed is how a requirement to sign consent forms might limit consent among workers in informal markets, which are commonly studied in One Health research. We suggest expansion of these, and development of further, studies towards improving consent processes in One Health research. (c) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Simulated willingness of farmers to adopt fertilizer micro-dosing and rainwater harvesting technologies in semi-arid and sub-humid farming systems in Tanzania
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Productivity of African agriculture falls below the global average due mainly to limited use of productivity-enhancing technologies. In Tanzania, smallholders farm without fertilizer on fragile soils in rain-fed areas. Inadequate soil nutrients, nutrient mining, and soil-moisture stress are the main factors limiting crop productivity. Fertilizer micro-dosing (MD) and rainwater harvesting (RWH) through tied ridges appear to be appropriate technologies to help replenish soil nutrients and improve soil moisture for increased crop production. It nonetheless remains unclear whether these technologies can be adopted by smallholder farmers in Tanzania. There have been limited efforts to predict adoption and diffusion of new technologies in Tanzanian agriculture. This paper assesses the willingness of farmers to adopt fertilizer MD with and without tied ridges. Data were obtained from a household baseline study, participatory ex-ante impact assessments, and simulation exercises. Our cross-section analysis used integrated ex-ante assessment tools to understand sustainability and to prioritize and sequence technology adoption and diffusion. Simulation predicted the ex-ante impact of selected technologies, the adoption rate peaks, the likelihood for reaching peaks, and the possible time required to reach peak adoption. Our findings suggest the best paths that technology users should take, while considering factors which affect adoption during research planning, implementation, and testing of the farm level technologies.

TI  - Prevalence of Aflatoxin- and Fumonisin-Producing Fungi Associated with Cereal Crops Grown in Zimbabwe and Their Associated Risks in a Climate Change Scenario
T2  - FOODS
AB  - In most sub-Saharan African countries, staple cereal grains harbor many fungi and some produce mycotoxins that negatively impact health and trade. Maize and three small grain cereals (sorghum, pearl millet, and finger millet) produced by smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe during 2016 and 2017 were examined for fungal community structure, and total aflatoxin (AF) and fumonisin (FM) content. A total of 800 maize and 180 small grain samples were collected at harvest and during storage from four agroecological zones. Fusarium spp. dominated the fungi associated with maize. Across crops, Aspergillus flavus constituted the main Aspergillus spp. Small grain cereals were less susceptible to both AF and FM. AF (52%) and FM (89%) prevalence was higher in maize than in small grains (13-25% for AF and 0-32% for FM). Less than 2% of small grain samples exceeded the EU regulatory limit for AF (4 mu g/kg), while <10% exceeded the EU regulatory limit for FM (1000 mu g/kg). For maize, 28% and 54% of samples exceeded AF and FM Codex guidance limits, respectively. Higher AF contamination occurred in the drier and hotter areas while more FM occurred in the wetter year. AF exposure risk assessment revealed that small grain consumption posed low health risks (<= 0.02 liver cancer cases/100,000 persons/year) while maize consumption potentially caused higher liver cancer rates of up to 9.2 cases/100,000 persons/year depending on the locality. Additionally, FM hazard quotients from maize consumption among children and adults were high in both years, but more so in a wet year than a dry year. Adoption of AF and FM management practices throughout the maize value chain coupled with policies supporting dietary diversification are needed to protect maize consumers in Zimbabwe from AF- and FM-associated health effects. The higher risk of health burden from diseases associated with elevated concentration of mycotoxins in preferred maize during climate change events can be relieved by increased consumption of small grains.

TI  - The long land grab: market-assisted enclosure on the China-Lao rubber frontier
T2  - TERRITORY POLITICS GOVERNANCE
AB  - The rise in transnational land deals has brought nationally inflected concerns about foreign land acquisition into uneasy tension with longstanding scholarly and popular concerns about dispossession. Using the case of Chinese rubber plantation promotion projects in northern Laos, we examine the intersection of these two processes during the boom decade of the 2000s, as well as the aftermath during the 2010s, when global rubber prices have fallen. We describe a 'long' land grab from upland communities in northern Laos that cannot be blamed on either 'the Chinese' (whether private, state or both) or Lao government policy, which has long mobilized political and legal authority to enclose smallholder lands for national development. Rather, what is significant is the interaction of regulatory politics and market dynamics under conditions of both unequal international relations and internally competing policy agendas on both sides of the border. Examining a case where the initial regulatory impulse from the host government was for the protection of smallholder land tenure, the paper demonstrates the need to examine the interaction of local land governance and international relations in a way that treats the latter as the product of internal struggles rather than coherent national strategy.

TI  - Campylobacter positivity and public health risks in live bird markets in Busia, Kenya: A value chain analysis
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
AB  - Live bird markets (LBMs) provide integral hubs for 95% of poultry produced for food. Surveillance systems in LBMs serving smallholder farmers in sub-saharan Africa are often non-functional, and data about public health risks and emerging pathogens are lacking. Studies in Kenya have reported 29-44% Campylobacter prevalence in poultry. We analysed such LBMs in Kenya for likely transmission of Campylobacter from poultry to humans. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 186 live poultry traders (LPTs) in 14 LBMs in a region with widespread backyard poultry systems. A pretested structured questionnaire was administered to all LPTs having regular contacts with poultry to gather market data and risk information on campylobacteriosis. Campylobacter was detected in individual cloacal cultures and identified through PCR. The median score obtained from the outcome of risk assessment dichotomized respondents into high and low risk categories. We performed logistic regression at 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare market characteristics and Campylobacter positivity to risk categories to identify LBM-associated public health risks. Markets had a median of 13 traders, and mean age of 46.3 +/- 13.7 years. Majority 162/186 (87.1%) were males. Market behavioural processes by LPTs varied: Only 58.6% LPTs held bird species separate; onsite slaughter (38.7%); encountered sick-bird (93%) and dead-bird (83%) amidst limited health inspection (31.2%). Campylobacter positivity in live birds was 43/112 (38.4%, 95% CI: 29.4-48.1). Risk information on campylobacteriosis was low 41/114 (36%, 95% CI: 27.2-45.5). Sanitary risks were related to accumulation of litter (adjusted prevalence odds ratio [aPOR]: 19.67, 95% CI: 3.01-128.52). Accessing hand-wash facilities (aPOR: .32, 95% CI: .13-.78) and access to information (aPOR: .24, 95% CI: .09-.61) were protective. Sanitary risks were related to poor hygiene. LBMs could be central surveillance sites for Campylobacter. Public health authorities/actors should consider appropriate targeting to improve sanitary measures and Campylobacter control strategies.

TI  - Rethinking the divide: Exploring the interdependence between global and nested local markets
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - The debate on smallholder commodification trajectories tends to be polarised between mainstream approaches that advocate tighter integration of smallholders into global value chains, and alternative approaches that favour localised markets on the grounds that these provide greater autonomy over production and marketing, and allow a greater share of value to be realised for producers and the wider community. This debate obscures the interrelations and possible synergies between them; a critique taken up in this paper. Using a case study on agricultural diversification in the former homeland of Venda, South Africa, we explore the usefulness of the nested markets concept to make sense of smallholders? patterning of markets by combining tree crops for export with seasonal vegetables for local markets. Exploring the drivers of diversification, we show how farmers? patterning of markets depends on their profiles and corresponding trajectory of accumulation. Local markets are articulated systems that function as hybrid spaces of interaction that enable farmers without any alternative offfarm income to gain and sustain access to global commodity markets. This challenges the framing of nested markets as an act of resistance as well as the dichotomy between local versus global markets as mutually exclusive. Instead, we argue that these markets can be interconnected and mutually supportive and are opportunistically used as such by petty commodity producers to sustain their export-oriented production system. If these relations are better understood, they stand to enable agrarian policy, which currently favours high-value tree crops, to be more inclusive of young and less well-resourced farmers.

TI  - Hermetic Bags Help Afghan Rural Women Preserve Wheat Flour during Winter
T2  - INSECTS
AB  - Simple Summary Afghan women face enormous challenges storing wheat flour during the winter due to high relative humidity and insect pests. These challenges result in poor-quality baking wheat flour. We conducted an experiment in Herat province, Afghanistan, to assess whether hermetic bags would preserve wheat flour during the wintertime when relative humidity is high. Forty women from two districts participated in this experiment. Each woman stored 25 kg of wheat flour in a Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bag and a polypropylene (PP) woven bag. The results showed that the moisture content, color, and baking properties of wheat flour stored in PICS bags for six months did not change. No insects were observed in wheat flour stored in PICS bags. However, wheat flour stored in PP bags had high moisture content and insect pests. The price of wheat flour stored in PICS bags increased over time, and that stored in PP bags decreased. Hermetic bags can be used to safely store wheat flour for six months in areas with high relative humidity conditions. Storing wheat flour in hermetic bags would help improve food security for millions of wheat consumers in developing countries. On-farm preservation of wheat flour is a challenge due to insect pests and high relative humidity. This experiment was conducted to assess the effectiveness of hermetic bags in preserving wheat flour stored by women during the wintertime when relative humidity is high. Forty women (households) from two districts in Herat province, Afghanistan, stored their wheat flour for 6 months. Each woman stored 25 kg of wheat flour in a Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bag and a polypropylene (PP) woven bag. Moisture content, insect population, flour color, bread taste, and profitability of storage were assessed. Moisture content and insect population significantly increased in PP bags after six months of storage, while no changes were observed in PICS bags. There was a significant negative correlation between wheat flour color and moisture content (r = -70.7, p < 0.001) and insect population (r = -79.9, p < 0.001). Wheat flour stored in PICS bags for 6 months retained its color and produced better bread than that stored in PP bags. Storing wheat flour in PICS bags for six months showed a return on investments (ROI) of +16.9% against -33% for the PP bag. Farm households and other wheat value chain actors can safely store wheat flour in hermetic bags for up to six months under high relative humidity conditions. This would help improve food security for millions of wheat consumers in developing countries.

TI  - RABBIT PRODUCTION IN LOW-INPUT SYSTEMS IN AFRICA: SITUATION, KNOWLEDGE AND PERSPECTIVES - A REVIEW
T2  - WORLD RABBIT SCIENCE
AB  - High poverty levels continue to plague much of Africa despite several intervention strategies aimed to stem the tide. The role of small livestock like rabbits as a tool in poverty alleviation programmes has been acknowledged for decades and successful national rabbit projects have clearly been demonstrated in Africa. With rising poverty levels across Africa, the need to rejuvenate such national rabbit projects for long-term sustainability becomes apparent. This presentation focuses on the status of rabbit production in Africa, with special attention to smallholder rabbit project development and its connection with poverty alleviation issues in the continent and with an emphasis on the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and barriers to the system. A special case is made for the sustainable development of smallholder, low-input rabbit production systems in Africa on account of their popularity, low investment requirements and low economic risks, as well as their contributions to family nutrition, income generation and gender empowerment. Successful rabbit projects in several countries across Africa were identified and the reasons for success, as well as lessons learned, are discussed. In all, several cases standout: the National Rabbit Project of Ghana, the Heifer Project International Rabbit Project in Cameroon, and CECURI Rabbit Project in Benin Republic. Other fast-paced and moderately developed rabbit industries (e.g. in Egypt, Tunisia and Algeria) are recognised. Critical constraints to rabbit project development (e.g. non-implementation of sustainable models for low-input rabbit units and absence of client-focused research and development programmes) are noted. Prospects for the development of sustainable smallholder rabbit production models are discussed, which include the following: a paradigm shift among researchers to focus on innovative research related to the development of sustainable backyard rabbit production systems; upscaling of sound practices in smallholder rabbit units across regions; use of local value chains in smallholder rabbit development and setting up regional networks of smallholder family rabbit projects. The actualisation of these goals requires a sustainability research agenda that focuses more on backyard rabbit farmers as the primary beneficiaries. Overall, the need for a poverty focus and a pro-poor research agenda involving owners of backyard rabbits are emphasised.

TI  - Strategy, Current Activities and Future Prospect for Advancing Indian Agricultural Machinery into the African Market
T2  - AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA
AB  - Africa is the world's second largest continent. It has the wide diversity across its different countries. A few are fairly well developed, but the majority is still developing. Within the continent, there is a noticeable difference in the degree of agricultural development between Africa and North Africa. India-Africa partnership for overall growth of the agriculture sector is moving towards one common goal-food security, and both economies have been flexible in their approach towards achieving the same. Therefore, there exists significant potential for both India and Africa to explore and leverage from various agricultural technologies that have been successful in increasing the productivity of small-scale farming. With Africa's economic growth gaining momentum, now is the time to evolve and collaborate for the agriculture sector to develop as a whole. The major innovations that can help increasing productivity include mechanical innovations such as the development of new seed varieties; fertilizer/pesticides; agronomic innovations, for examples, novel agricultural management practices such as no-till/zero-till agriculture and inter-cropping. To help crop yield and achieve the larger goal of food security, interventions from all value chain stakeholders are required. For instance farm input manufacturer needs to develop appropriate tools and technologies to better respond to diverse soil and changing climate types, whereas investments in processing infrastructure are required to reduce post-harvest losses. The African governments should have Policies and Regulations for better mechanization options that is to create conducive environment for successful agricultural mechanization, remove restrictions to choice, leasing or credit programmes for imported machinery as well as locally produced machines, support information for better decision making by farmers, legislation for safe, durable and reliable machinery and equipment. Increasing land and labour productivity should be adhering too as agricultural productivity is positively correlated with farm power. Conservation agriculture (no-till/reduced-till, permanent organic soil cover, crop rotations), multi-cropping, precision agriculture, controlled traffic farming and permanent raised beds with residue retention are some of the priority area for sustainable agriculture. The Policy priorities should be to enhance mechanization demand, stabilizing mechanization supply, strengthening institutions needed for mechanization development, Private-Public Partnerships for mechanization development, integrate mechanization and good agronomic practices for environmental sustainability and special focus on increasing agricultural mechanization among smallholders.

TI  - Drivers of Antibiotic Use in Poultry Production in Bangladesh: Dependencies and Dynamics of a Patron-Client Relationship
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - Background: There is increasing concern around the use of antibiotics in animal food production and the risk of transmission of antimicrobial resistance within the food chain. In many low and middle-income countries, including Bangladesh, the commercial poultry sector comprises small-scale producers who are dependent on credit from poultry dealers to buy day-old chicks and poultry feed. The same dealers also supply and promote antibiotics. The credit system is reliant upon informal relationships among multiple actors as part of social capital. This paper aims to describe dependencies and relationships between different actors within unregulated broiler poultry production systems to understand the social and contextual determinants of antibiotic use in low-resource settings.
   Methods: We used a cross-sectional qualitative design including in-depth interviews among purposefully selected commercial poultry farmers (n = 10), poultry dealers (n = 5), sales representatives of livestock pharmaceutical companies (n = 3) and the local government livestock officer as a key-informant (n = 1). We describe the food production cycle and practices relating to credit purchases and sales using social capital theory.
   Findings: Poultry dealers provide credit and information for small-scale poultry farmers to initiate and operate their business. In return for credit, farmers are obliged to buy poultry feed and medicine from their dealer and sell their market-ready poultry to that same dealer. All farms applied multiple antibiotics to poultry throughout the production cycle, including banned antibiotics such as colistin sulfate. The relationship between dealers and poultry farmers is reciprocal but mostly regulated by the dealers. Dealers were the main influencers of decision-making by farmers, particularly around antibiotic use as an integral part of the production cycle risk management. Our findings suggest that strategies to improve antibiotic stewardship and responsible use should exploit the patron-client relationship which provides the social and information network for small-scale farmers.
   Conclusion: Social capital theory can be applied to the patron-client relationship observed among poultry farmers and dealers in Bangladesh to identify influences on decision making and antibiotic use. Within unregulated food production systems, strategies to promote the prudent use of antibiotics should target commercial feed producers and livestock pharmaceutical manufacturers as a first step in developing a sustainable poultry value chain.

TI  - To cluster or not to cluster farmers? Influences on network interactions, risk perceptions, and adoption of aquaculture practices
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Over the course of just a few years, shrimp farming has become a major aquaculture production system in coastal areas of several developing countries across the globe. However, farmers are facing a variety of risks related to disease, market, and climate, which influence risk management strategies and adoption of new technologies. This paper looks at three practices related to pond management: (1) water quality management to ensure a good environment for shrimp growth; (2) adequate feed input; and (3) disease control practices in order to mitigate the risk of disease outbreak in the pond. We investigated adoption of these three practices in smallholder shrimp farms in the Mekong Delta, by exploring how and whether membership into a producer's cluster influences access to knowledge and perception of risk in the adoption process. The results show that, after controlling for farm characteristics, farm clustering has a positive relationship with the adoption of water quality management, feed inputs, and disease control practices. Results also indicate that increasing interaction frequency with public sector and private sector's actors, as well as the perceived degree of market risk, positively influences the adoption of the three pond management practices under study. Mediation analyses show that being a member of a farmer cluster influences adoption of farming practices via two underlying processes: frequency of interaction with public and private sector's actors, and perception of market risk, both of which ultimately promote the adoption of practices. We conclude that clustering is a promising avenue for fostering interactions between farmers and key supporting actors in aquaculture, and impacts both the formation of specific aqua-related risk perceptions and subsequent practice adoption. As such, clusters - by fostering linkages and facilitating interactions between different knowledge sources - can promote adoption of practices toward sustainable intensification. However, to more effectively deploy a cluster approach a key policy and practice implication is to take into consideration local idiosyncrasies defined by their social interactions, risk perception and spatial dimensions in order to better facilitate local linkages between farms (horizontal coordination) and a better integration with the value chain (vertical coordination).

TI  - Slicing the fruit five ways: An economic, social, and environmental assessment of five mango food supply chains in Burkina Faso
T2  - SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB  - Food supply chains (FSCs) not only need to be competitive, but increasingly face scarce resources and societal pressure for sustainable development. This paper assesses the economic, social, and environmental sustainability of five different FSCs that are all competing for the same primary product. We used the value chain methodology for the economic sustainability, life cycle assessment for the analysis of environmental sustainability, and a scoring approach for social sustainability. We applied these methodologies to five FSCs competing for mangoes in Burkina Faso: 1) the FSC of fresh mangoes exported (by boat or by plane) to the European Union, 2) the FSC of fresh mangoes exported to continental Africa, 3) the FSC of dried mangoes exported to Europe, 4) the FSC of mango juice and puree, and 5), the FSC of fresh mangoes consumed in Burkina Faso. For each FSC, we considered: 1) the added value per kilogramme; 2) male and female employment; 3) the contribution to the national economy; 4) working conditions; 5) the contribution to household food and nutritional security; 6) damage to human health per added value, 7) damage to ecosystems per added value, and 8) increased resource scarcity per added value. None of the FSCs obtained a perfect score. The domestic FSC had the best sustainability indicators and the African FSC distributed the highest share of added value to farmers. The number of middlemen, the operating costs, the trade value of the mangoes, and bargaining power, are the main factors affecting the distribution of the added value. The informal sector is a major factor that affects the social assessment through access to land and to most social rights. Distance and transport technology are the main factors that affect the environmental sustainability. Our results will help improve benchmarking of FSCs in a sustainability framework, targeting of private funding investment, and policy support for sustainable development.

TI  - Plant diversity management in cocoa agroforestry systems in West and Central Africa-effects of markets and household needs
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Cocoa production in humid forest landscapes has been one of the main cash providers of West and Central African economies. Along with the liberalization of the perennial tree sector, there are increased fluctuations of cocoa income. At the same time, the demand and interest for timber production and non-wood forest products have also been increasing. With the continuous disappearance of natural forests, the production of these commodities is being shifted into cocoa agroforests and plantations. In view of helping research and development institutions in promoting sustainable tree crop systems, this paper attempts, for the main cocoa producing countries of West Africa (Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire), to: (1) document the temporal evolution of the market demand for forests and non-wood forest products both at the local and international levels; (2) explore the set of tree species that can be produced in cocoa agroforests of WCA to satisfy this demand. Deforestation resulting partly from the expansion of perennial orchards and slash and burn agriculture is: (i) leading to a shortage of suitable forest land necessary to stabilize or increase national cocoa production and (ii) increasing the gap between the demand and availability/supply of non-wood forest products(NWFP) and timber by reducing the main source of these products-the forest. Demand of these products is increasing with the growth of urban and peri-urban centers. At the same time, perennial agroforestry systems such as cocoa agroforest are increasingly perceived as assets for Payment for Environmental Services (PES) such as carbon storage and biodiversity conservation, because of the potential of the resources that they can generate. These demands of products and payment for ecosystem services that can be provided by sustainable cocoa agroforestry systems depends upon the appropriate combination of cocoa, timber and non-timber forest trees on the same land. Such demands is still to be properly exploited in the region. Cocoa agroforests in West Africa are characterized by fewer species than those of Central Africa. The level of market access influences the types of species that are managed inside cocoa agroforests. Among the species potentially associable with cocoa, those demanded by the local, regional and international markets are not necessarily the ones that are more frequent in the cocoa fields. The gradual reduction of natural forest, from which timber and non-timber products are gathered, aroused the need to integrate the growing of such species in cocoa agroforestry systems.

TI  - Demand for Taenia solium Cysticercosis Vaccine: Lessons and Insights From the Pig Production and Trading Nodes of the Uganda Pig Value Chain
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - Taenia solium cysticercosis disease remains a key challenge to the pig sector in low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and South East Asia, resulting in both economic losses and public health impacts. The World Health Organization has ranked it first on the global scale of foodborne parasites. A One Health approach has been recommended for reduction of infection pressure and eradication in the longer term. A new vaccine TSOL18 (Cysvax (TM)), applied in combination with oxfendazole (Paranthic 10%(TM)), a dewormer drug has been developed and field tested for the control of T. solium cysticercosis, with high potential to break the disease cycle. It is however unclear whether the products can be marketed through a market driven approach, and if smallholder pig farmers would be willing to take up and pay for the vaccine-oxfendazole combination. A choice experiment methodology was used to assess the potential demand and willingness to pay for the vaccine-oxfendazole combination by Ugandan smallholder pig farmers, and demand for vaccinated pigs by pig traders. The results showed that farmers highly valued quality assurance attributes and were not keen on the vaccine if there were no associated returns in the form of premium price for vaccinated pigs during sales. They were willing to pay US$ 2.31 for the vaccine if it resulted in a premium price for vaccinated pigs. Furthermore, they preferred an accompanying vaccine viability detector as part of its quality assurance. The pig traders on the other hand preferred high carcass weight of pigs, potentially achieved by using oxfendazole. The results show that unless the pig market systems pay a premium price for vaccinated pigs, and quality assurance systems guarantee quality vaccine, uptake of the TSOL18 vaccine and oxfendazole by farmers through market mechanisms may be unsuccessful. The current pig marketing system does not reward food safety, the focus is mainly on carcass weight. Alternative delivery mechanisms for the vaccine through a mix of private-public investments needs to be explored, as the benefits of vaccinated pigs are societal and include reduction and elimination of neurocysticercosis in the long run.

TI  - Towards an integrative perspective on commercialised wild-gathered bamboo use: insights into the extraction of lung bamboo in the Vietnamese uplands
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY
AB  - Bamboo is a vital non-timber forest product (NTFP) and income source for rural communities in the Global South, including in Latin America, Asia, Africa and Oceania. Due to the manifold goods and services it provides to society, bamboo has recently drawn considerable attention in the forest-development discourse. The potential that bamboo offers as a substitute for timber in the industrialised production of pulp, paper, charcoal and flooring is spurring bamboo commercialisation in light of nascent bamboo-processing industries. This is most apparent in Asia, where Viet Nam has some of the largest forest bamboo resources and ambitious government plans aim to boost sector development in the future. As is observable worldwide, the bulk of bamboo in Viet Nam grows naturally, often as a weakly regulated common-pool resource. Hence, as for many other wild-gathered NTFPs, the commercialisation of the harvesting, trading and processing of forest bamboo raises questions about balancing use and conservation to achieve long-term sustainability. Empirical studies that provide an integrative perspective on wild-gathered bamboo commercialisation are rare. To close the knowledge gap, this exploratory study investigates the social, economic and ecological dimensions of the commercialisation of lung bamboo (Bambusa longissima sp. nov.), a native bamboo species endemic to north-central Viet Nam. We combined quantitative and qualitative social science research methods with a forest inventory of selected lung bamboo exploitation sites in the Que Phong district (a mountainous region of Nghe An province), where lung bamboo use constitutes a vital element of local livelihoods. Our results highlight the need to consider the complex interplay of local livelihoods, harvesting regimes, institutional arrangements and value-chain configurations to understand the ecological outcomes of wild-gathered bamboo commercialisation. We call for the adoption of an integrative perspective when designing practical project interventions, sector plans and policies for forest bamboo commercialisation. Promoting alternative livelihood options, robust and clear institutional arrangements to regulate access and tenure, capacity building in management and harvesting and, not least, supportive commodity-chain governance are critical elements on the pathway to greater sustainability in wild-gathered bamboo commercialisation.

TI  - Bitter sugarification: sugar frontier and contract farming in Uganda
T2  - GLOBALIZATIONS
AB  - Contract farming schemes have recently been portrayed by global development agencies as an alternative to 'land grabs', promoting processes of inclusive development through the integration of smallholders within global agro-industrial production complexes. The paper takes issue with such argument, using the case-study of contract farming scheme at Kakira Sugar Works in Uganda as empirical terrain for this investigation. It argues that despite contract farming schemes at first sight appear not to generate dispossession or displacement, they lead to forms of expulsion and/or marginalization of poor smallholders from sugar agro-poles through social differentiation. It also maintains that rather than being the antithesis to land enclosures, contract farming represents one instance of global neoliberal agricultural restructuring, functional to the expansion of the sugar frontier at cheap costs. This process, which I term sugarification, involves the maximization of value extraction from farmers, its appropriation by agribusiness and finance capital, and a regime of production which devaluates labour (wage and family) and nature, while dramatically affecting existing livelihoods and landscapes.

TI  - Does the rise of transnational governance 'hollow-out' the state? Discourse analysis of the mandatory Indonesian sustainable palm oil policy
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Rise of transnational business governance has been used to argue that state control has declined, giving rise to the metaphor of a 'hollowed-out state'. However, an alternative hypothesis is that, instead of a weakening of the state, a transformation occurs. This study uses interviews and discourse analysis to explore the main factors that trigger initiation of a new government policy following extra-territorial transnational negotiations. The Indonesian palm oil sector, specifically publication of the mandatory certification for Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) policy, is used as a case study. We also explore aspects of the ISPO and oil palm sector that need focusing in order to improve sustainable palm oil sector governance. Q methodology was used to reveal different discourses on the formation and implementation of ISPO policy. We interviewed 36 stakeholders to gather the qualitative data used for the Q concourse; and engaged 27 stakeholders in the Q sorting process. Five distinct discourses were revealed. Two discourses include state sovereignty and the need to strengthen the local sector as triggering factors for ISPO initiation. The other three discourses highlight scepticism about the ISPO, covering financial aspects and conservation value debates; and contain challenges and suggestions for ISPO implementation. The study concludes that, in the Indonesian palm oil sector at least, 'the hollow-state' hypothesis is not wholly correct. Instead, the government is undergoing a transformation and is enhancing national institutional capacity through the ISPO. However, there are some major concerns. To better shape the governance of sustainability in this sector the government needs to focus on aspects of policy implementation related to biodiversity conservation values and benefits for the producers when being certified, as well as improving engagement with stakeholders.

TI  - The potential of in-situ hyperspectral remote sensing for differentiating 12 banana genotypes grown in Uganda
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Bananas and plantains provide food and income for more than 50 million smallholder farmers in East and Central African (ECA) countries. However, banana productivity generally achieves less than optimal yield potential ( < 30%) in most regions, including Uganda. Numerous studies have been undertaken to identify the key challenges that smallholder banana growers face at different stages of the banana value chain, with one of the main constraints being a lack of policy-relevant agricultural data. The World Bank (WB) initiated a methodological survey design aimed at identifying the distribution of banana varieties across a number of key Ugandan growing regions, at the individual household scale. To achieve this outcome a number of approaches including ground-based surveys, DNA tissue collection of selected banana plants and remote sensing were evaluated. For the remote sensing component, the set objectives were to develop statistical models from the hyperspectral reflectance properties of individual leaves that could differentiate typical ECA banana varieties, as well as their parentage (usage). The study also explored the potential of extrapolating the ground-based hyperspectral measures to high-resolution WorldView-3 (WV3) satellite imagery, therefore creating the potential of mapping the distribution of banana varieties at a regional scale. The DNA testing of 43 banana varieties propagated at the National Banana Research Program site at National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) research station in Kampala, Uganda, identified 12 genetically different varieties. A canonical powered partial least square (CPPLS) model developed from hyperspectral reflectance properties of the sampled banana leaves successfully differentiated BLU, BOG, GON, GRO and KAY genotypes. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was also evaluated to determine if spectral bands coinciding with those provided by WV3 data could segregate banana varieties. The results suggested that this was achievable and as such presents an opportunity to extrapolate the hyperspectral classifications to broader areas of land. The ability to spectrally differentiate these five genotypes has merit as they are not typical east African varieties. As such, identifying the distribution and density of these varieties across Uganda provides vital information to the banana breeders of NARO of where their new varieties are being disseminated too, data that has been previously difficult to obtain. Although the results from this pilot study indicated that not all banana varieties could be spectrally differentiated, the methodology developed and the positive results that were achieved do present remote sensing as a complimentary technology to the ongoing surveying of banana and other crop types grown within Ugandan household farming systems.

TI  - Improving the smallholder balsa value chain in East New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY
AB  - Ochroma pyramidale (balsa) is a fast-growing tree, grown as a plantation crop by both companies and smallholders in East New Britain Province (ENB) of Papua New Guinea (PNG). The ENB balsa industry is entirely export-oriented, producing 9% of the world's processed balsa. Balsa products have outstanding strength-for-weight qualities and an increasing market in high-technology composite materials, such as wind turbine blades and transportation applications. Ochroma pyramidale is attractive to smallholders because it is a relatively low labour-input crop with competitive returns and a relatively short (5-6years) harvest cycle. There are c. 6200ha of balsa plantations in ENB, including c. 1900ha grown and managed by c. 1500 individual smallholder farmers. A workforce of some 2500-3000 is engaged in balsa harvest, transport, processing and export in ENB. These activities operate under the regulatory oversight of the PNG Forest Authority, which also plays an honest broker' role in transactions between processing companies and smallholders. The major challenges faced by the ENB balsa industry relate to balsa plantation productivity and sustainability, market access in the context of forest certification and legality verification, and product development and diversification. This paper reports outcomes of a research project supported by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, in which Australian and PNG researchers worked with the ENB balsa industry to address these challenges. The project conducted balsa sector surveys and silvicultural experiments, introduced and tested genetic resources, and undertook both knowledge and product development for the industry. Key research outcomes included the development of a smallholder friendly' silvicultural regime that obviates the need for thinning or refilling, and should deliver greater merchantable volume and value recovery for growers; an updated Balsa Manual from which smallholder learning resources were developed and integrated into an established ENB agricultural training program; confirmation that harvesting recovery from smallholder plantations was consistent with log quality requirements, and that harvesting and transport activities were operating efficiently; and the development of new balsa panel products particularly suited to apartment interiors. Research also facilitated the adoption of certification in the ENB balsa sector, and identified targeted regulatory reform as desirable to support the continuing development of the ENB balsa industry.

TI  - Do food certification standards guarantee small-sized farming enterprises access to better markets? Effectiveness of marketing contracts in Kenya
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of GLOBALGAP standards certification on farmer's preference for marketing contract choices including written contracts, oral contracts and spot contracts, as well as to establish the impact of marketing contracts on net returns from snap bean production in Kenya. Design/methodology/approach In this study, we use a data collected from 446 Snap bean farmers in Kenya. Using a two-step selection Bourguignon Frontier and Gurgand (BFG) model and Propensity Score Matching (PSM), we analysed determinants of Global Gap Certification and other farming characteristics that influence smallholder farmers preference for marketing contracts and net returns from snap beans venture. Findings Results indicate that attending GLOBALGAP training, GLOBALGAP subsidy support, membership to GLOBALGAP farmer's groups, and selling beans to GLOBALGAP certified GLOBALGAP buyers would significantly influence better returns underwritten marketing contracts. Producing snap beans underwritten marketing contracts would get farmer's net returns of between 1.8 and 8% while producing under oral and spot market contracts would earn farmer net returns of between 0.2 and 0.08 %. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to examine the influence of GLOBALGAP standards certification on marketing contract choices and net returns from snap bean production, while accounting for selectivity biasness.

TI  - Exploring the potential of household methodologies to strengthen gender equality and improve smallholder livelihoods: Research in Malawi in maize based systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - Household methodologies (HHM) intervene directly in intra-household gender relations to strengthen overall smallholder agency and efficacy as economic agents and development actors. Strengthening women's agency is one mechanism for progressing towards collaborative, systemic farm management. It is expected this will contribute to improved farm resilience in the face of climate change, strengthen food and nutrition security, and improve other development indicators.
   HHM are built around a vision, gendered analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT), an action plan, and indicators. Some HHM- including Gender Action Learning Systems (GALS), the focus of the research- use drawings making them easy to use for low-literate individuals. There is considerable evaluation report evidence of the efficacy of HHM in strengthening value chains, food security, and gender equality. However, this has yet to be complemented by a robust systematic evaluation of the methodology which includes non-intervention communities as controls. Here we report on the findings of a research study into GALS in Malawi where the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi (NASFAM) has been implementing GALS since 2013 with 4274 farmers (2821 women and 1453 men to May 2016). We held sex-disaggregated FGDs with 40 GALS households and 40 non-GALS households, all NASFAM members. Community profiles and a matrix activity focusing on task allocation, asset distribution, and expenditures by gender with 125 non-GALS and 135 GALS respondents were also conducted.
   Our analyses indicate a significant shift towards sharing of on-farm tasks and household tasks, and joint realization of the benefits from agricultural produce in GALS households. They are building up portfolios of assets including livestock, houses, ox-carts, and land, unlike non-GALS households. Respondents in GALS households, particularly de facto women-headed households, report an increase in social standing and participation in community life. In both GALS and non-GALS households, men and women agree that men continue to dominate marketing and are final decision-makers. However, financial transparency and intra-household agreement on expenditures characterize households with GALS participants.

TI  - Exclusion and Counter-exclusion: The Struggle over Shrimp Farming in a Coastal Village in Bangladesh
T2  - DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
AB  - This article explores the processes whereby control over land and water is exercised in the context of commercial shrimp cultivation in coastal Bangladesh. The authors draw on the insight that the exercise of control over resources implies both inclusion for some and exclusion for others, and that shifting the boundary between the two involves the deployment of four interacting powers of exclusion' regulation, the market, force and legitimation the effectiveness of which depends on specific historical conjunctures. The article uses a case study of a village in Khulna District to explore: (a) the processes by which poor farmers were excluded from their land by large shrimp farmers; (b) the ways in which villagers experienced the changes in land use and social relations associated with the shrimp boom; and (c) the conjunction of internal and external factors that enabled smallholders to collectively mobilize to reverse their exclusion from the land. Understanding these messy and contingent processes of exclusion and counter-exclusion helps to inform strategies aimed at securing the property rights and livelihoods of the rural poor.

TI  - Gendered experiences of dispossession: oil palm expansion in a Dayak Hibun community in West Kalimantan
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - This article explores the gendered experience of monocrop oil-palm expansion in a Hibun Dayak community in Sanggau District, West Kalimantan (Indonesia). It shows how the expanding corporate plantation and contract farming system has undermined the position and livelihood of indigenous women in this already patriarchal community. The shifting of land tenure from the community to the state and the practice of the 'family head' system of smallholder plot registration has eroded women's rights to land, and women are becoming a class of plantation labour. At the same time, as in other cases of expansion of agrarian corporate commodity production, we can discern a familiar pattern of ambivalence between, on the one hand, the attractions of regular cash income and, on the other, the loss of resource tenure and autonomy, which helps to explain the community's gendered experience of coercion, exploitation, intimidation, consent and resistance.

TI  - The evolution of the land struggle for smallholder irrigated rice production in Nante, Mozambique
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
AB  - The case of Munda Munda irrigation system in Nante, Zambezia, Mozambique, is an example of how a smallholder community, with the active support of local NGOs, has successfully defended its land and water resources against several attempts of resource grabbing. This article examines the strategies the community used to defend its resources. After an initial struggle over legal entitlements the discussion shifted to questions of efficient and productive use of the land. This shift is possible in the context of Mozambican land law which prohibits land from being privately owned while simultaneously aiming to regulate external investments on a basis of arguments of productive use of resources. Smallholders sustained their claim of productive use by switching to 'modern' technologies (tractor, fertilizers, improved seeds), investments in infrastructure (rehabilitation and extension of the irrigation system) and commercialisation of their production (increase of yields, processing and marketing). At a second level the case reveals a conflict between two alternative rural development models, the company/concessionary model and the smallholder/cooperative model. The dynamics in Nante are an expression of how this dichotomy plays out at a local level. The article is based on a long-term involvement in the area since 2004. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Role of Social Norms in Natural Resource Management: The Case of the Communal Land Distribution Program in Northern Ethiopia
T2  - LAND
AB  - The increasing population pressure in the rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa has caused land degradation as well as an increase in the number of landless farmers. To promote a conservation-oriented utilization of communal lands and increase the livelihood of poor farmers, the Ethiopian government introduced a program to distribute less-utilized communal lands to landless farmers. This study identified the social norms related to natural resource conservation that affect the participation in this program. Using data from 477 farmer households in northern Ethiopia, we estimated probit models with endogenous regressors for the determinants of social norms and their impacts on program participation. The results show that social norms related to conservation positively affect program participation. Regarding policy implication of the findings, an intervention to improve the social norms of local farmers leads to sustainable resource conservation without reducing intrinsic motivation of the local people. A conservation-oriented utilization of the communal lands would be more effective if the land distribution program was accompanied by other programs to improve the social norms in the villages.

TI  - Innovations in the agro-food system Adoption of certified organic food and green food by Chinese consumers
T2  - BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors driving the adoption of "green innovations" notably green food and certified organic food and to examine the attitudes of Chinese consumers towards genetically modified food.
   Design/methodology/approach - A mixed methods approach was used. A total of 402 consumers responded to a structured questionnaire and 58 consumers responded to a survey designed to gather qualitative data. Data analysis involved content analysis, the probit model, frequency distributions and the t-test for two unrelated means.
   Findings - This study shows that affluent, middle class Chinese citizens are opting out of the conventional food market. There is a gender divide, with men showing a preference for green food and females showing a preference for certified organic food. Certified food purchase is associated with demographic variables, such as income, education, age, gender, presence of young children, household size, living in developed cities and overseas experience. A follow-up study shows that the absence of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) motivates the purchase of organic food. Overall, the results suggest that Chinese consumers are turning towards certified food for health reasons and are sceptical about genetic modification (GM) food.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper provides some insights into how Chinese consumers view innovations in the food sector. The study found that almost half of the sample is unaware that the concept of green food is different to that of organic food. The priority for the certified organic industry is to address this lack of knowledge and clearly explain what certified organic food is and how it differs from green food. Small-scale farmers could use consumer aversion to GMOs as a promotional tool. The ultimate goal of this paper is to help marketers better promote certified organic food, but inferences can be drawn in terms of Chinese sustainable consumption. Negative attitudes towards genetically modified foods exist due to human health concerns. Hence, Chinese policy makers need to confront these perceptions, real or perceived, if they wish to maintain public trust in biotechnology.
   Practical implications - Based on the qualitative data, stressing the GM-free status is likely to enhance sales since there appears to be a segment of consumers that distrusts GM technology.
   Originality/value - The contribution of this research lies in examining what drives the adoption of "green innovations", notably green food and certified organic food in China. This research is important given that little is known about what Chinese consumers think of, and how they react to, innovations in the agro-food value chain.

TI  - Farmers' Sources and Varieties of Cassava Planting Materials in Coastal Kenya
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) grows in diverse agro-ecological zones. In Kenya, it is widely cultivated in Western and Coastal regions. It is mainly grown for food and nutrition security and excess roots are sold to generate income for the farm households. Its productivity per unit of the land area is high compared to maize and wheat which are staple crops in the country. However, scarcity of cassava planting materials and pests and diseases limit production in these regions. This study aimed at revealing the sources and varieties of cassava planting materials used by farmers and other farmers' practices in coastal Kenya. Four focus group discussions (FGD) and a survey were conducted in 2018, using a semi-structured questionnaire targeting 250 farmers. The data collected on the sources of planting materials, preferred varieties and the practices employed by the farmers in cassava production, was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Majority of farmers (83%) interviewed indicated that they recycled planting materials from the previous crop while some 67% respondents obtained the planting material from their neighbors. Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization's (KALRO) and the local markets were reported as sources of planting materials by 11 and 5% farmer respondents, respectively. The only formal seed source reported was KALRO. The rest, own seed, neighbors, and the local markets, were informal seed sources. Piecemeal harvesting practiced by 98% of the farmers favored planting material recycling. Farmers dedicated a small proportion of their land (mean 0.2 ha) to cassava production as reported by 60 and 72.8% of farmers from Taita Taveta and Kilifi, respectively. Slightly above half (56%) of the farmers in Kilifi dedicated slightly more land to cassava, planting between 100 and 4,000 cuttings (2.5% of an acre up to a full acre) compared to 87% farmers from Taita Taveta who planted 100 cuttings or less (which is about 2.5% of an acre or less). A majority (81.1%) of farmers in Taita Taveta planted local cassava varieties compared to Kilifi's 57.8%. Slightly above half of the farmer respondents reported Kibandameno as the preferred variety followed by Tajirika as the second preferred variety as reported by 18% farmers. Kibandameno was preferred for its sweet taste by 75.6% farmers while Tajirika was preferred by 52.4% farmers because of the high yielding capacity. Nearly all farmer respondents, in Taita Taveta County obtained the planting material from informal seed sources, except a negligible number, who reported buying their planting material from KALRO, a formal seed source, far from their locality. Farmers sourcing cuttings from a formal seed source such as those from Kilifi County were more likely to use a tractor for land preparation compared to those who sourced planting materials informally who more likely had scarce knowledge on cassava production and the value of cassava. Therefore, interventions to establish a sustainable healthy cassava planting materials seed system are needed to address the systemic constraint and help develop a viable cassava value chain.

TI  - Charcoal supply chains from Mabalane to Maputo: Who benefits?
T2  - ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - In urban centres of Mozambique, charcoal is the major energy source for cooking. Growing demand drives high wood extraction rates over increasing areas of miombo and mopane woodlands. Charcoal production can lead to changes in ecosystem service provision and woodland degradation while also significantly contributing to rural income and, possibly, poverty alleviation. As such, understanding charcoal production and trade has important implications for rural areas and for the sustainable development of woodland resources. Here, we investigate charcoal production and trade through empirical research conducted in Gaza Province, the main charcoal supply area for Maputo, Mozambique.
   We analyse the present structure of the main charcoal supply chains from Gaza province to Maputo and the profit distribution along them. Seven villages in the Mabalane district, Gaza, at different stages of engagement with the charcoal industry, were selected for investigation. We conducted household surveys and semi-structured interviews with key informants (village leaders, charcoal producers, licence holders, wholesalers, transporters and forest technicians), from May to October 2014.
   Our results highlight two main charcoal supply chains comprising four main actor groups a) Local small-scale operators producing charcoal on a small-scale with household labour, who sell to wholesalers b) Large-scale operators producing and commercialising large volumes of charcoal using migrant labour, who sell their own production to wholesalers. While charcoal production constitutes an important income source for rural households in Mabalane, under supply chain a) more than 90% of the monetary benefits do not reach local communities and remain with external agents. Two of the main factors impeding the generation of greater revenues at community level are: 1) bureaucratic burdens in obtaining charcoal commercialisation rights in the form of licences; and 2) weak institutional capacities for woodland resource governance.
   We conclude that access to markets and control over woodlands is key if local communities are to generate greater benefits from charcoal production while aiming at sustainable charcoal production. Strong local institutions for obtaining commercialisation rights and managing woodland resources have to be developed, while the restructuring of the licencing systemin favour of small-scale producers and more rigorous control of the regulations could support this process.

TI  - The leakage and livelihood impacts of PES contracts: A targeting experiment in Malawi
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Most evaluations of payments for environmental services programs focus on immediate environmental impacts, and do not measure the effects on socioeconomic outcomes or on other land use activities (leakage). Efficient allocation of land use contracts, through auctions for example, may help mitigate concerns about adverse livelihood or leakage effects. This study reports on a field experiment that varied the allocation of afforestation contracts to smallholder farmers in Malawi. Households were randomly assigned to participate in an auction or in a lottery for the contracts, which provided three years of payment based on tree survival outcomes. Households that did not receive a contract as a result of the lottery form a pure comparison group. The results show evidence for within-farm leakage for households that received a contract at random, in the form of additional land clearing. Randomly contracted households are also more likely to report household labor shortages. These effects are mitigated to some degree when contracts are assigned through an auction. Together, the results point to leakage and livelihood impacts from payments for environmental services that are often overlooked in standard evaluations, but which may be reduced through improvements in contract targeting.

TI  - Modeling Smallholder Farmers' Preferences for Soil Management Measures: A Case Study From South Ethiopia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Land degradation is a major environmental problem in Ethiopia posing serious threats to agricultural productivity and livelihoods. The interactions of numerous socio-economic, demographic, natural, and institutional factors constitute the underlying causes of soil degradation in Ethiopia. However, there exist evidence gaps on the contextual factors that hinder investments on soil conservation among smallholders. Using primary data generated through a stated preference survey among 359 sample smallholder farm households in Southern Ethiopia, this study investigates investment constraints on soil management technologies among smallholders. A random parameter logit model was implemented to estimate the model. Results indicate that smallholders are willing to invest in soil management technologies if appropriate incentive mechanisms, primarily, secured land tenure rights and access to finance are in place. Unfortunately, the prevailing land tenure regime in the country does not allow private property rights on land and smallholders have very limited access to credit. Thus, instituting secure land rights and improving credit access to smallholders should be considered as key interventions to enhance adoption of soil management technologies. The study highlights that policy interventions that incentivize adoption of soil management measures provide not only on-site private benefits but wider societal off-site benefits through the provision of multiple ecosystem services.

TI  - Who Adopts Agroforestry in a Subsistence Economy?-Lessons from the Terai of Nepal
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Agroforestry is recognized as a sustainable land use practice. However, the uptake of such a promising land use practice is slow. Through this research, carried out in a Terai district of Nepal, we thoroughly examine what influences farmers' choice of agroforestry adoption and what discourages the adoption. For this, a total of 288 households were surveyed using a structured questionnaire. Two agroforestry practices were compared with conventional agriculture with the help of the Multinomial Logistic Regression (MNL) model. The likelihood of adoption was found to be influenced by gender: the male-headed households were more likely to adopt the tree-based farming practice. Having a source of off-farm income was positively associated with the adoption decision of farmers. Area of farmland was found as the major constraint to agroforestry adoption for smallholder farmers. Some other variables that affected positively included livestock herd size, provision of extension service, home-to- forest distance, farmers' group membership and awareness of farmers about environmental benefits of agroforestry. Irrigation was another adoption constraint that the study area farmers were faced with. The households with a means of transport and with a larger family (household) size were found to be reluctant regarding agroforestry adoption. A collective farming practice could be a strategy to engage the smallholder farmers in agroforestry.

TI  - Smallholder livelihood resilience to climate variability in South-Eastern Kenya, 2012-2015
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Climate change, land degradation, demographic change and persistent poverty pose major challenges to smallholder farmers in the arid and semi-arid lands of sub-Saharan Africa. Though many studies have focused on how resilient these households are to shocks, very few studies deal with how household resilience varies over time. We provide a longitudinal analysis to assess how the resilience of smallholder households in south-eastern Kenya has varied from 2012 to 2015. We use the Livelihood Resilience Indicator Framework to examine the linkages between livelihood outcomes and livelihood resilience (buffer capacity, self-organization and capacity for learning). We collected data from 134 households on three resilience dimensions: buffer capacity, self-organization, and capacity for learning. We performed principal component analysis to identify the key components of these dimensions and examine their relevance for livelihood outcomes. Our findings show that under drought conditions in 2012, conservation agriculture practices significantly contributed to maize yields. In both years 2012 and 2015, there was a positive correlation between resilience dimensions and food security. Key components of this relation were land area, income, conservation agriculture practices, climate forecasts and actions taken for the upcoming growing season.

TI  - Leveling the field for biofuels: comparing the economic and environmental impacts of biofuel and other export crops in Malawi
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Biofuels often raise the specter of food insecurity, water resource depletion, and greenhouse gas emissions from land clearing. These concerns underpin the sustainability criteria governing access to European biofuel markets. However, it is unclear if producing biofuels in low-income countries does exacerbate poverty and food insecurity, and moreover, whether the sustainability criteria should apply to all agricultural exports entering European markets. We develop an integrated modeling framework to simultaneously assess the economic and environmental impacts of producing biofuels in Malawi. We incorporate the effects of land use change on crop water use, and the opportunity costs of using scarce resources for biofuels instead of other crops. We find that biofuel production reduces poverty and food insecurity by raising household incomes. Irrigated outgrower schemes, rather than estate farms, lead to better economic outcomes, fewer emissions, and similar water requirements. Nevertheless, to gain access to European markets, Malawi would need to reduce emissions from ethanol plants. We find that biofuels' economic and emissions outcomes are generally preferable to tobacco or soybeans. We conclude that the sustainability criteria encourage more sustainable biofuel production in countries like Malawi, but are perhaps overly biased against biofuels since other export crops raise similar concerns about food security and environmental impacts.

TI  - Land control dynamics and social-ecological transformations in upland Philippines
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - Recent scholarship on land grabs has begun exploring the complexity of local dynamics of land control, with emphasis on the concepts of access and exclusion and the social processes that influence these two. In this paper, I emphasize that a nuanced examination of broader social-ecological transformations would enrich our understanding of land control and exclusion. Drawing from field research in the Philippine province of Palawan, this paper examines how the combined effects of the practices of conservation enclosures, the uneven land accumulation brought about by oil palm expansion, and the use of legitimizing upland discourses all contribute to social-ecological transformations in swidden and the exclusion of indigenous smallholders from benefiting from integral forms of swidden agriculture. These practices of land control and the associated social-ecological transformations are not just interconnected, but also characterized by feedback mechanisms. The more smallholders decide to alter (or abandon) swidden practices, participate in oil palm contract farming, and/or sell their land to oil palm growers, the greater the tendency for land to accumulate among migrant settlers and absentee landowners. This, in turn, may lead to further reduction in the availability of fallow land and exclusion of more indigenous smallholders over time.

TI  - Evolutionary game analysis of green production transformation of small farmers led by cooperatives based on prospect theory
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - For countries with small farmers as the main body of agricultural production, green production transformation of small farmers is crucial to achieve green agricultural development. Based on the prospect theory, this paper builds an evolutionary game model of cooperative leading the green production transformation of small farmers, systematically deduces the possible combination of different strategies of both sides, and puts forward targeted countermeasures for improvement. Finally, the simulation is verified, and the influence of relevant parameters on the decision-making of both sides is analyzed. In the initial stage of green production transformation, the local government's support to the cooperative supervision and incentive strategy is the key to the successful transformation. Cooperatives can effectively promote small farmers' transition to green production by reducing green production costs and increasing their perceived ecological benefits, moral benefits and brand benefits, but the effect of simply increasing the proportion of dividends is not obvious. Under the supervision and incentive strategy of cooperatives, there is an interval in which small farmers adopt cooperation strategy but fail to realize income increase, so cooperatives should increase the benefit distribution of small farmers. The research results provide reference for the green production transformation of small farmers, and also have strong enlightenment for the cooperative hitchhiking governance.

TI  - Rural Azerbaijan through Quantitative and Qualitative Research Lenses: Debating the Transition to Small Farm Capitalism
T2  - RURAL SOCIOLOGY
AB  - This article examines agrarian relations in post-Soviet Azerbaijan after redistributive land reforms. We argue that the reforms failed to establish small-farm capitalism on former collective and state farm land. Commodity production in rural Azerbaijan is characterized by increasing concentration of land and capital, and the recipients of the privatized land shares procure livelihoods not through commercial farming, but through a combination of strategies-including wages, remittances from migrant relatives, and subsistence agriculture. This study is based on the combination of state statistics, government reports, and local ethnography-in-depth interviews with land reform administrators and with rural residents in six diverse villages from two distinct regions of Azerbaijan. Previous studies of post-Soviet transition in rural Azerbaijan reported different results of the land reforms. A quantitative account based on the state statistics reported a postreform countryside where small farmers, former collective and state laborers, live off their privatized land shares and increase agricultural productivity. A qualitative account based on local ethnography suggested that the privatized land shares play a marginal role in the livelihoods of local residents. We show how the discrepancy is illusory and stems from an erroneous, legal definition of "small farms" used in the state statistics, which conflates socially distinct categories of land use. When the statistical terms are put into their social context, the quantitative data confirm the qualitative findings.

TI  - Unpacking land-associated assemblages ?from below?: Smallholders? land access strategies at the commercial tree-crop frontier
T2  - POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Market-oriented agrarian transformation challenges notions of the 'communal' nature of customary land. This paper foregrounds the emergent patterns of land access in the context of an expanding tree-crop commodity frontier in the former 'homeland' of Venda, South Africa. We develop an actor-focused, assemblage approach and use it to identify how three entrepreneurial, accumulating tree-crop farmers engaging in commercial macadamia nut and avocado production mediate land access through a combination of historic access, social networks, insider-knowledge, access to capital and brokering of good community relations through land sharing and job provisioning. We approach this mediation as (re)-assembling practices that unfold within the particular condi-tions at this historical conjuncture and the gradual agricultural de-activation in food crop production and ur-banisation occurring locally. These practices blend collective and private elements into an unwieldy, land-associated assemblage in ways that challenge the political economical reading of the commoditisation trend as a 'the single land grab', 'accumulation from below' or as leading to the neoliberalisation of African land tenure systems. We argue that this reconstruction 'from below' requires attention to the way situated practices forge relations to other (translocal)assemblages, local agency in shaping land-and production relations, the oppor-tunity structure related to changes in the local political economy and a sensibility to the multiple, possible fu-tures of this frontier moment.

TI  - 'Because of poverty, we had to come together': collective action for improved food security in rural Kenya and Uganda
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Agricultural productivity in East African smallholder systems is notoriously low and food production faces multiple challenges, including soil degradation, decreasing land availability, poor market integration, disease burdens and climate change impacts. However, recent evidence from an in-depth study from two sites in Kenya and Uganda shows signs of new social dynamics as a response to these multiple stressors. This paper focuses on the emergence of local social institutions for collective action, in which particularly women farmers organize themselves. Although previous research on collective action has largely focused on common-pool resource management, we argue that collective action is one potential pathway to livelihood and sustainability improvements also in a setting of private land ownership. Trust building, awareness raising and actions to improve livelihood security through risk sharing and pooling of labour and other limited assets have given people more time and resources available for diversification, preventative activities, experimentation and resource conservation. It thereby strengthens farmers' capacity to cope with and adapt to change, as well as contributes to the agency at the local level.

TI  - Mismatches between mill-cultivated sugarcane and smallholding farming in Brazil: Environmental and socioeconomic impacts
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Brazil is a country historically characterized by high levels of capital and land ownership concentration, and some areas where family farming is traditionally strong are potentially impacted by the expansion of sugarcane, through land renting contracts between farmers (landowners) and sugar mills (tenants). This paper examines the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of mill-cultivated sugarcane expansion on family farming in the municipality of Ipiranga de Goias, Goias state, Brazil, where sugarcane plantations compete with corn, pasture and dairy cattle. Using a questionnaire composed of closed-and open-ended questions, we interviewed 28 family farmers, which were divided into two groups: those with and those without land renting contracts with the ethanol and sugar mill. The results show differences between both groups, such as average area size, main source of income, past and current activities, and perceptions about the pros and cons of sugarcane expansion. Land leasing emerged as a short-term solution to the shortage of on-farm labor and other economic difficulties small farmers continue to face. There are some farmers, however, who have resisted leasing their land for a number of reasons, including revenue is too low due to the small area in question; they also want to avoid loss of autonomy in production and the deep transformation of their rural way of life and landscape.

TI  - Equity in the distribution of values of outputs from exclosures in Tigray, Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - Land degradation is a widespread problem throughout the Tigray Region in Ethiopia, and establishing exclosures to restore degraded land has been in practice for many years. The authors examine how outputs obtained from exclosures are distributed among households adjacent to the exclosures and identify factors that influence the distribution of values of outputs. Data were collected from 446 households living next to nine exclosures in Tigray. The Gini coefficient, probit regression, and multiple linear regression were applied to the data sets. The results revealed that the distribution of values of outputs varied from fairly equal to quite unequal, depending on the exclosures' attributes and the appropriators' attributes. A more equal distribution values of outputs from exclosures was found where the density of appropriators was higher or/and in villages next to exclosures that were protected for longer periods. Wealthier households with larger herd sizes obtained a larger share of outputs from the exclosures, while households in the lowest income quantile received almost nothing. This may raise concerns among those interested in pro-poor measures. The authors did not find any evidence that household responsibility for managing and protecting exclosures had significant impacts on the distribution of values of outputs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of cooperative membership on farm performance indicators such as apple yields, net returns and household income, using cross-sectional data from a survey of farmers in China. An endogenous switching regression model that accounts for selection bias is employed in the analysis. The empirical results reveal that cooperative membership exerts a positive and statistically significant impact on apple yields, farm net returns and household income. A disaggregated analysis also reveals that small-scale farms tend to benefit more from cooperatives than medium and large farms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - European union non-tariff barriers to imports of African biofuels
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - The introduction of EU mandates for biofuel use in the transport sector initially led to high expectations that African countries would benefit from biofuel exports to the EU. This market opportunity has not been realised, however, due to regulatory requirements for the production of biofuels that act as non-tariff barriers to the acceptance of African biofuels in the EU. This benefits producers of biofuel crops and processors in the EU by providing economic protection. In particular, the EU import regime fails to acknowledge the challenges faced by African (or other) developing countries in satisfying the requirements. Using a computable general equilibrium model for Malawi, we quantify the foregone potential benefits from biofuel production for exports to the EU arising from non-tariff barriers (NTBs) embedded in the sustainability criteria. Our results show that sugarcane-ethanol production under smallholder outgrower regimes would lead to both economic growth outcomes and rural development, whereas jatropha-biodiesel fails to increase rural incomes due to low profitability. While there is widespread agreement on the latter today, our study is the first to explore the failure of jatropha in Malawi in an economy-wide framework. The ethanol results, however, also hold if land clearing is forbidden, thereby preserving biodiversity as stipulated under the sustainability criteria in the EU Renewable Energy Directive. The EU NTBs embedded in the Renewable Energy Directive thus play a much larger role for countries in Sub-Sahara Africa than simply inhibiting investment opportunities and should be refashioned to lower the entry costs for developing countries.

TI  - Sustainable businesses development in post-conflict zones: a case in rural Colombia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose - Farmers in Colombia have faced economic instability due to a long-lasting armed conflict. An attempt to support the rural community has been through the creation of productive alliances -a strategic association between small-scale producers and anchor companies with the assistance of the private and public sectors. By closely examining the Association of Guarupay Palm Growers (ASOPAY)'s financial cash flows, this study investigates the challenges faced by small-scale agribusinesses in an emerging economy.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study addresses the situation of ASOPAY, an oil palm productive alliance formed by families displaced by the Colombian armed conflict and relocated in the eastern foothills of the Andes Mountains. By closely examining ASOPAY's financial flows, the article sheds light on the economic incentives enhancing the cohesion of the small-farmers' association.
   Findings - A key finding is the critical role played by institutional efforts focused by promoting policies to enhance producers income. In addition, technological transfers made through technical assistance programs may improve the association's profitability by enhancing agronomic practices, while decreasing palm mortality and disease incidence.
   Research limitations/implications - The relatively small sample used in the study might rise concerns regarding the generalization of the outcomes. However, the authors implemented strategies to overcome these limitations by incorporating the inputs from experts on the oil palm supply chain in Colombia and from experts in rural development.
   Originality/value -To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the financial success of small farmers in post-conflict zones.

TI  - The livelihood impacts of oil palm: smallholders in Indonesia
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - The biodiversity and climate consequences of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) expansion across South East Asia have received considerable attention. The human side of the issue, highlighted with reports of negative livelihood outcomes and rights abuses by oil palm companies, has also led to controversy. Oil palm related conflicts have been widely documented in Indonesia yet uptake by farmers has also been extensive. An assessment of the livelihood impacts of oil palm development, including sources of conflict, is needed to shed light on the apparent contradiction between these reports and the evident enthusiasm of farmers to join the oil palm craze thereby informing future expansion. We assessed the impact of oil palm development on the economic wellbeing of rural farmers in Indonesia. We found that many smallholders have benefited substantially from the higher returns to land and labour afforded by oil palm but district authorities and smallholder cooperatives play key roles in the realisation of benefits. Conflicts between communities and companies have resulted almost entirely from lack of transparency, the absence of free, prior, and informed consent and unequal benefit sharing, and have been exacerbated by the absence of clear land rights. We make specific recommendations to improve the present situation and foster the establishment of smallholder friendly production regimes. Oil palm expansion in Indonesia is set to continue. If environmental standards can be raised and policy interventions targeted at the broader social impacts of land development this expansion may be achieved to the significant benefit of large numbers of rural smallholders.

TI  - Adoption of sustainable silvopastoral practices in Argentina's Gran Chaco: A multilevel approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - The Gran Chaco is currently a global hotspot of deforestation and environmental degradation. Halting global warming and curbing biodiversity losses are urgent priorities and recent research suggests that sustainable smallholder production systems could contribute to maintain and restore key ecosystem services. This article examines the adoption of two silvopastoral practices in Argentina's Gran Chaco. We conducted a survey of 552 smallholders in three municipalities in the province of Salta. With the resulting data, we used multilevel models to assess adoption of the two practices. Our multilevel models indicate several factors that are associated with adoption, including: gender of the household head, year of establishment, literacy of the household head, membership in a producer organization, and socio-economic status. Our results suggest that paraje - groups of neighbouring households or joint settlements - are a good predictor of adoption, whereas nearby villages are only marginally associated with adoption. We conclude by highlighting the importance of accounting for local structures and groups of households in rural studies.

TI  - Forest outgrower schemes in small and medium-sized farmers in Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Outgrower schemes are an alternative for supplying companies and can generate benefits for both the farmers and for the community. The main reasons that lead companies to adopt this type of strategy are the reduction of investment in land purchases, lower cost of wood at the factory, to increase the diversification of sources of raw materials, as well as greater integration with landowners close of companies. Of the total of 7.84 million hectares of trees planted in Brazil in 2016, 34% belonged to companies in the pulp and paper industry, 29% were independent operators and participants in outgrower schemes, and the charcoal-fired steel industry represented 14% of the planted area. In 2016, 19,900 people benefited from the outgrower programs adopted by Brazilian Tree Industry (IBA) member companies, planting 545,000 ha. For rural producers, the forest development consists of an alternative to traditional income generation to their properties, which may use idle or underused areas with low technical risk due to production inputs and technical assistance provided by the companies. The most frequent outgrower modalities include providing forest species seedlings, revenue anticipation programs and wood purchase guarantee at harvest time. For the community, these include the possibility of creating new wood-based forest business and generating jobs in the region. This program prevents land concentration, makes local activities feasible, creates opportunities of additional income and assists in settling people in the countryside. Also, greatly improves the acceptability of eucalypt plantations in the region and is positive for the certification of forest products. From the environmental standpoint, outgrower scheme mitigates the pressure on native forests, recovers degraded soils and promotes soil conservation.

TI  - Benefits Derived from Rehabilitating a Degraded Semi-Arid Rangeland in Private Enclosures in West Pokot County, Kenya
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Rehabilitating degraded rangelands using enclosures offers various benefits to agro-pastoral households. However, enclosure benefits cannot be generalized as there are variations across dryland ecosystems and societies. This study assessed the qualitative and quantitative benefits derived from rehabilitating degraded rangelands using private enclosures in Chepareria, West Pokot County, Kenya. Dry-season grazing reserves, healthier livestock, improved livestock productivity, easier livestock management, food security, reduced animal losses, ecosystem services, land ownership, independence and improved standard of living were the main qualitative benefits from private enclosures identified. Quantitative benefits were manifested through various enclosure enterprise combinations, sale of enclosure marketable products and adoption of alternative income generating activities. They included the sale of livestock and livestock products, maize, wood cutting, grass cuttings, contractual grazing, grass seeds, poultry products, fruits and honey, amongst others. Livestock production directly accounts for 424% of the total enclosure income and is the main source of livelihood in Chepareria. There was a significant trend of increasing total enclosure income with enclosure acreage (p005) while enclosure age was insignificant. Enclosures cushion households against climatic shocks such as drought by providing additional flexibility in land, fodder, livestock management and the uptake of various income generating activities. We conclude that enclosures have the potential of contributing to resilience as attested from the benefits reported in this study. However, private enclosure tradeoffs such income differentiation, reduced communal land and conflict have implications on how the ecological and socio-economic aspects may be impacted as the establishment of private enclosures in Chepareria continues.

TI  - Informal Property Rights as Relational and Functional: Unravelling the Relational Contract in China's Informal Housing Market
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH
AB  - In the face of state-led land grabs, enterprising Chinese peasants have started a revolution in the ambiguous and insecure rural tenure system by developing an extralegal property system known as the small property right (SPR). Using the SPR, peasants are able to capitalize on their property through the sale of houses built on collectively owned land. Little is known, however, about the specific process behind the development of the SPR by the peasants, or how this extralegal property system functions in terms of securing the use and transfer of property without the backing of law. This article aims to clarify the situation through the lenses of the Endogenous Nature of Institutions and Relational Contract Theory, aiming to understand the socially constructed, endogenous and relational nature of the property rights that make SPR functional. Based on an ethnographic investigation of Beijing's largest SPR housing settlement, we show how enterprising peasants develop long-term relational contracts with urban households for the provision of housing services, secured on the basis of the common interests and symbiosis of the two parties and a reputation system that serves to deter defaults. The discretionary treatment of SPR housing by local states serves as a further motivation for the village and the informal homeowners to preserve a stable property arrangement, with such a specific institutional setting being an exemplar of China's pragmatic state entrepreneurialism.

TI  - Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation of participation in collective actions and adoption of climate-smart farming technologies in South-West Nigeria
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
AB  - Enhancing sustainable food security requires agricultural production systems to change in the direction of higher productivity and to mitigate lower output variability in the face of climate extreme related hazards such as land degradation. Adoption of resilient food production system capable of withstanding disruptive events is therefore needed to stabilize farmers' productivity. Consequently, participation in collective actions has been touted as an effective approach to enhance cooperation among individuals within a social system and to advance adoption of climate-smart farming techniques (conservation agriculture). This study investigated this perspective using heterogeneous treatment effects estimation to analyze the data collected from 350 smallholder farmers selected randomly from the South-West Nigeria. The average treatment effects on the treated estimate revealed that participation in collective actions had adoption-increasing effect for each unit variation in propensity score rank, although, negative selection effect was suspected. Similarly, information acquisition, access to extension service and frequency of visit by extension workers are significant features that predict adoption in the study area. However, rosenbaum sensitivity analysis test revealed that the increasing effect of participation in collective actions on conservation agriculture adoption is insensitive to unobserved bias that may double or triple the odds of exposure to treatment. Hence, the average treatment effect on the treated estimate is a pure impact of the participation in collective actions. The study concluded that farmers with high propensity to participate in collective action have high likelihood to adopt climate-resilient farming practices compared to the counterparts with a lower propensity of participation in collective action.

TI  - Does Service Utilization Improve Members' Welfare? Evidence from Citrus Cooperatives in China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Farmers' professional cooperatives (hereinafter referred to as "cooperatives") are an important carrier for small farmers to organically connect to the big market. Under the background of frequent phenomena such as generalization of cooperatives, cooperative alienation, empty shelled cooperatives and involution of cooperatives in China, whether cooperatives can improve members' welfare has attracted the attention of all walks of life. Service is the essential attribute of cooperatives, and the key to the functioning of cooperatives is the services utilization by members (hereinafter referred to as "service utilization"). Therefore, examining the impact of service utilization on members' welfare has important theoretical and practical significance, which helps to scientifically evaluate of the current value of cooperatives in China and then objectively respond to questions about the development of cooperatives. Thus, this study takes the micro-survey data of 74 citrus cooperatives and 524 citrus members in Citrus County, Sichuan Province, China as examples, and uses the endogenous switching model to empirically analyze the impact of service utilization on members' welfare. The results show that the level of service utilization is not high, and only half of the members use cooperative services. However, service utilization can significantly improve members' welfare. Specifically, the average treatment effect of service utilization on citrus yields, net returns and household income is respectively 285.446 kg/mu, 1290 yuan/mu and 4980 yuan/person. Simultaneously, service utilization can increase citrus yields, net returns and household income by 13.49%, 18.32% and 17.99% on average. Finally, some countermeasures and suggestions are put forward, such as actively publicizing cooperative's services, guiding members to use cooperative's services, improving the standardization level of cooperatives and strengthening policy support for cooperatives.

TI  - Measuring the effect of agricultural cooperatives on household income: Case study of a rice-producing cooperative in China
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - Agricultural cooperatives in China, known as Farmers' Professional Cooperatives (FPCs), are becoming popular and have been intensely promoted by the Chinese government to improve the economic welfare of small farmers. However, few studies on FPCs have measured the benefits to gain farmers who participate in FPCs after controlling for observable attributes of farmers. This paper investigates the treatment effect of participation in a rice-producing cooperative in suburban China using the propensity score matching (PSM) method. Estimated results show that a significant difference is observed between participants and nonparticipants of the cooperative in terms of net income from rice production. In addition, there is significant heterogeneity of the treatment effects between large and small farmers. Therefore, we can conclude that the participation in agricultural cooperatives is more beneficial to relatively small farmers who are subject to suffer from higher transaction costs.

TI  - Characteristics of commercial and traditional village poultry farming in Mali with a focus on practices influencing the risk of transmission of avian influenza and Newcastle disease
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
AB  - We aimed at characterizing commercial and traditional village poultry farming in Mali, with a focus on practices influencing the risk of transmission of avian influenza and Newcastle disease. Surveys were conducted in 2009-2011 in a study area covering approximately 98% of the Malian poultry population. Among the 282 commercial farms investigated, of which 64 had not been known by the government authorities, 83% were located within a 50 km radius from the capitals of the country and regions and 54% had low biosecurity standard. Among the 152 randomly selected village household flocks investigated, characteristics were overall similar to those in other African countries but some differences were notable including a large flock size (median 44 poultry), a low presence of ducks and geese (11% and 1.1% of flocks, respectively), vaccination against Newcastle disease being common (49% of flocks), a low proportion of households selling sick and dead birds (0.7% and 0%, respectively) and limited cohabitation between poultry and humans at night. Our recommendations to limit the risk of disease transmission include (1) for commercial farms, to introduce compulsory farm registration and accreditation, to increase technical proficiency and access to credit for farms with low biosecurity, and to support poultry producer associations; (2) for village poultry, to promote better quarantine and management of sick and dead birds. Such detailed knowledge of country-specific characteristics of poultry production systems is essential to be able to develop more efficient disease risk management policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Smartphone-based information acquisition and wheat farm performance: insights from a doubly robust IPWRA estimator
T2  - ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH
AB  - This study examines the impact of smartphone-based information acquisition on crop yields, net returns, return on investment (ROI), and production costs, using survey data collected from 558 wheat farmers in rural China. We employ a double-robust inverse probability weighted regression adjustment estimator to address the potential selection bias issue. The results reveal that information acquisition via smartphones significantly increases wheat yields, net returns, and ROI by 7%, 31%, and 39%, respectively, and it has a negative but insignificant impact on production costs. These results largely echo the results estimated from propensity score matching and endogenous switching regression models. In general, our findings suggest that policy interventions targeting to boost farm economic performance should consider distributing agricultural production and marketing information via smartphones.

TI  - Can Tanzania realise rural development through biofuel plantations? Insights from the study in Rufiji District
T2  - ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Biofuel is a fast growing sector in Tanzania. Foreign and domestic companies are acquiring big portions of land, some up to 440,000 hectares. It is believed that the country has a reserve of 88 million hectares for agriculture. The government is committed to promoting the sector. But what are the implications of biofuel plantations for rural development in Tanzania? This is an area of inquiry which has not received adequate attention. The main objective of the study was to investigate whether biofuel plantations will have any significant impact on rural development in Tanzania, using the case of Rufiji District. The choice of the district was fourfold. One, it has a considerable number of potential biofuel investors. Two, a high proportion of the investors intend to use the vertical integration model of production, processing and marketing. Three, the district is dominated by smallholder farmers, who are poor with chronic food insecurity. Four, Rufiji district is rich in biodiversity and natural resources. The findings from this study will reflect the likely impact of biofuel plantations on rural development as the selected district represents the characteristics of many rural areas of Tanzania. A total of 161 respondents were selected randomly for interview. There were also consultations with village governments, non-government organisations, policy makers and researchers. The findings show both high expectations and concerns. The respondents anticipate benefiting from employment, income-generating opportunities, access to markets for crops, and improved social services. More men than female respondents are hoping to become out-growers. However, male respondents in particular were concerned about land grabbing while for women it was about food security, water use conflicts and whether they will be able to access clean energy. The lack of a biofuel policy and legal framework as well as poor rural infrastructure may undermine the realisation of biofuel benefits. (C) 2012 International Energy Initiative.

TI  - Adoption and economic impacts of laser land leveling in the irrigated rice-wheat system in Haryana, India using endogenous switching regression
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
AB  - This study assesses the factors affecting the adoption of laser land leveling (LLL) and its impact on crop yields and net returns. It uses household survey data collected from 621 randomly selected farmers in Karnal District of Haryana, India, and applies endogenous switching regression models. Unbiased model results show that the adoption of LLL has significant positive impacts on yields (rice +549 kg ha(-1); wheat +471 kg ha(-1)) and net returns (an aggregate increase of US$230/ha) in the rice-wheat production system, thereby raising farmers' income substantially. Our results show that LLL adoption at the farm level is influenced by land size and quality, tenure system, availability of farm machinery (tractor), access to finance and farm cooperatives, gender of household head, level of education and training and access to extension services. Therefore, LLL scaling strategies need to consider these bio-physical and socio-economic parameters to reach adoption at scale and generate large social, economic, and environmental benefits.

TI  - Shared centre pivot. An experience of smallholder irrigation in Midwest Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB  - Irrigation enables crop intensification and improves the smallholder's household livelihood. Centre pivot irri-gation, a system predominantly used in medium to large individual farms, has recently been promoted for smallholder collective irrigation in developing countries. The objective of this research was to assess the irri-gation performance and evolution of shared centre pivot systems at the Itamarati Rural Settlement in the Mid-west of Brazil, where around 1000 smallholders were organized in small groups between 2001 and 2004, to farm 85 centre pivots collectively. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected in a mixed-approach, and used to characterize the evolution and sustainability of the centre pivots shared. We collected information from pub-lished and unpublished reports, and we conducted our own surveys, interviewing twenty-five farm groups and forming focus groups in a 3-year phased process. Irrigation intensity (the ratio of irrigated area over the area equipped for irrigation) declined sharply from 0.75 in 2004/2005-0.12 in 2020. The immediate pressures triggering the abandonment process were: the farmers' insufficient technical capability, low productivity of the irrigated crops, and high operational and maintenance costs. At the root of these drivers was the incapacity to exert the collective action required by the highly centralized shared centre pivot system. The progressive giving up of collective management and the concentration of land in larger farms seems to be inexorable. The Itamarati experience was a paradigm of a top-down project whose lessons are important for policymakers. We concluded that centralized collective systems are unsustainable unless the community that adopts them has a high sense of union and a capacity for collective action.

TI  - Enhancing soil organic carbon, particulate organic carbon and microbial biomass in semi-arid rangeland using pasture enclosures
T2  - BMC ECOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundRehabilitation of degraded rangelands through the establishment of enclosures (fencing grazing lands) is believed to improve soil quality and livelihoods, and enhance the sustainability of rangelands. Grazing dominated enclosure (GDE) and contractual grazing enclosure (CGE) are the common enclosure management systems in West Pokot County, Kenya. Under CGE, a farmer owning few animals leases the enclosure to households with relatively more livestock, while GDE is where the livestock utilizing the enclosure are purely owned by the farmer. Livestock management in both systems is via the free-range system. This study evaluated the effect of enclosure management on total soil organic carbon (SOC), particulate organic carbon (POC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) as key indicators of soil degradation at 0-40cm depth. The two enclosure systems were selected based on three age classes (3-10, 11-20 and >20years since establishment) (n=3). The adjacent open grazing area (OGR) was used as a reference (n=9).ResultsRelative to OGR, the pasture enclosures significantly decreased soil bulk density and increased the concentrations of total organic C, POC, MBC and MBN compared to the degraded OGR (P<0.001). Significantly higher concentrations of POC and MBC was recorded in GDE than CGE (P=0.01). The POC accounted for 24.5-29.5% of the total SOC. MBC concentrations ranged from 32.057.25 to 96.63 +/- 5.31 mu gCg(-1) of soil in all grazing systems, and was positively correlated with total SOC and POC (P<0.001). The proportional increase in POC and MBC was higher in GDE (56.6 and 30.5% respectively) compared to CGE (39.2 and 13.9% for POC and MBC respectively).Conclusions This study demonstrated that controlling livestock grazing through the establishment of pasture enclosures is the key strategy to enhance total SOC, POC, MBC, and MBN in degraded rangelands; a precondition for improving soil quality. Therefore, the establishment of enclosures is an effective restoration approach to restore degraded soils in semi-arid rangelands.

TI  - Index Insurance: Using Public Data to Benefit Small-Scale Agriculture
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - This paper highlights the importance of public data for the development of more efficient and sustainable risk management schemes, such as index insurance, for smallholder agriculture. Three case studies of index insurance-catastrophic weather insurance in Mexico, satellite-based insurance for pastoralists in Kenya, and a hypothetical area-yield insurance scheme in Ecuador-are briefly analyzed in terms of the data and type of index used, the way the contract was designed and implemented (or simulated) and the impacts of the insurance on investment, nutrition and income smoothing. The increasing opportunity to use big data for improving and expanding index insurance is also addressed. The analysis suggests that the strong potential for index insurance to improve the welfare of small farmers represents a clear justification for increased government investment in the collection of the types of data that can facilitate the expansion of index insurance markets.

TI  - Small Farmers and Big Retail: Trade-offs of Supplying Supermarkets in Nicaragua
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - In Nicaragua and elsewhere in Central America, small-scale farmers are weighing the risks of entering into contracts with supermarket chains. We use unique data from cooperatives supplying supermarkets to study the effect of supply agreements on producers' mean output prices and price stability. We find that prices paid by the domestic retail chain approximate the traditional market in mean and variance while mean prices paid by Walmart are significantly lower than the traditional market. However, the Walmart contract is found to systematically reduce price volatility. We find some evidence, however, that farmers may be paying too much for this contractual insurance against price variation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Can the use of the internet improve fish farmers? financial performance? Evidence from Ghana
T2  - MARINE POLICY
AB  - This study's investigation is about how Internet usage affects the financial performance of Ghanaian fish pro-ducers. We used a sample size of 222 fish farmers after employing the multistage sampling approach and the endogenous treatment regression (ETR) technique to achieve the study's objective. The results estimated after dealing with the endogeneity issue depict that the association between farm financial performance and Internet utilization has both heterogenous and homogenous impacts. Specifically, Internet use homogenously caused a significant rise in Net returns, Return on Investment (ROI), and Profit Margin of the fish farmers. Also, regarding the heterogeneous farm financial performance effect of using the Internet analysis, it was revealed that Internet use enhances the farmers' Net returns, ROI, and Profit Margin regardless of their gender or household income status. Generally, our findings recommend that policies that boost aquaculture practitioners' economic and financial performance should consider enhancing Internet connectivity across the nation.

TI  - Exploring Barriers to Agroforestry Adoption by Cocoa Farmers in South-Western Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Agroforestry is part of the package of good agricultural practices (GAPs) referred to as a reference to basic environmental and operational conditions necessary for the safe, healthy, and sustainable production of cocoa. Furthermore, cocoa agroforestry is one of the most effective nature-based solutions to address global change including land degradation, nutrient depletion, climate change, biodiversity loss, food and nutrition insecurity, and rural poverty and current cocoa supply chain issues. This study was carried out in South-Western Cote d'Ivoire through a household survey to assess the willingness of cocoa farmers to adopt cocoa agroforestry, a key step towards achieving sustainability in the cocoa supply chain markedly threatened by all types of biophysical and socio-economic challenges. In total, 910 cocoa households were randomly selected and individually interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Findings revealed that from the overwhelming proportion of farmers practicing full-sun cocoa farming with little or no companion trees associated, 50.2 to 82.1% were willing to plant and to keep fewer than 20 trees per ha in their farms for more than 20 years after planting. The most preferred trees provide a range of ecosystem services, including timber and food production, as well as shade regulation. More than half of the interviewed households considered keeping in their trees in their plantations for more than 20 years subject to the existence of a formal contract to protect their rights and tree ownership. This opinion is significantly affected by age, gender, access to seedlings of companion trees and financial resources. A bold step forward towards transitioning to cocoa agroforestry and thereby agroecological intensification lies in (i) solving the issue of land tenure and tree ownership by raising awareness about the new forest code and, particularly, the understanding of cocoa agroforestry, (ii) highlighting the added value of trees in cocoa lands, and (iii) facilitating access to improved cocoa companion tree materials and incentives. Trends emerged from this six-year-old study about potential obstacles likely to impede the adoption of agroforestry by cocoa farmers meet the conclusions of several studies recently rolled out in the same region for a sustainable cocoa sector, thereby confirming that not only the relevance of this work but also its contribution to paving the way for the promotion of agroecological transition in cocoa farming.

TI  - Effects of cooperative membership on financial performance of banana farmers in China: A heterogeneous analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper estimates the heterogeneous effects of cooperative membership on smallholder farmers' financial performance, measured by net returns, return on investment (ROI), and profit margin. We employ an innovative two-stage predictor substitution model combined with an unconditional quantile regression model to address the endogeneity of the cooperative membership variable and analyze data collected from 626 banana farmers in China. Results, in general, show that cooperative membership improves banana farm financial performance. Particularly, we show that cooperative membership affects net returns and ROI positively and significantly across the selected unconditional quantiles, with the highest impact occurring at the highest 80th quantile. Cooperative membership also has a positive and significant impact on the profit margin for all quantiles (except for the 20th quantile), but the larger impacts occurring at the lower quantiles.

TI  - Does contract farming improve profits and food safety? Evidence from tomato cultivation in Nepal
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to quantify the benefits of contract farming (CF) on farmers' income and adoption of food safety measures (FSMs) at the farm level. The paper also investigates the determinants of participation in CF.
   Design/methodology/approach The study is based on a survey of 600 tomato farmers from Nepal. Descriptive statistics, regression analysis (using instrumental variable) and propensity score matching have been used to accomplish the objectives of the study.
   Findings The study found that the CF ensures higher returns to farmers as well as higher adoption of FSMs at the farm level. The contract farmers earned about 38 per cent higher net returns and had 38 per cent higher adoption of FSM as compared to independent farmers. Caste, occupation, farm size and cropping intensity significantly affected farmers' participation in CF.
   Research limitations/implications The analysis based on cross-section data has limitations to consider unobserved farmer-level individual heterogeneity.
   Originality/value This study will provide an empirical base to promote CF in Nepal. The study will also contribute to bridge the gap in literature on the drivers of CF and its impact on smallholders' income and compliance with FSM in Nepal.

TI  - Improving small farmer participation in export marketing channels: perceptions of US fresh produce importers
T2  - SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify important elements of a strategy to facilitate small farmer participation in international supply chains for fresh produce.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study employs survey data collected from a national sample of US fresh produce importers. Their concerns and suggestions regarding potential for transactions with small Mexican farmers were assessed, with factor analysis providing a thematic summary of their perspectives.
   Findings - Results of the study reveal that US importers are not uniformly pessimistic about the ability of small farmers to meet their demands. On the contrary, almost one-third said they probably would work with small farmers in the near future. in general, importers are interested in transactions in which the product meets consumer and government expectations and is grown on the buyer's terms, the grower is reliable over time, the transaction is simplified, and the grower handles transportation. Importers rate small farmers poorly on their ability to achieve the last two factors, but these are also the items rated least important to the importers. New approaches to building market capacity in small farmers are also highly valued by the importers, including government investment guarantees, and arrangements for facilitating contact between importers and growers. More traditional methods, such as cooperatives and use of brokers, were not rated as highly.
   Research limitations/implications - The study relies on cross-sectional, self-report data from one side of the grower/importer dyad. Incorporating longitudinal data with a dyadic perspective could provide additional insight.
   Originality/value - A practitioner perspective on the challenges in international fruit and vegetable supply chains, particularly as relates to developing countries, is of considerable value. Not only can governments choose improved policies for improving market readiness for the growers, but also members of supply chains themselves can identify tactics for ensuring successful transactions by enhancing coordination. The prospects for a win-win outcome for growers and importers are improved.

AB  - A new impetus is emerging with regard to the potential role that agricultural producer associations might play in improving rural economies. For this study, the use of cereal banking to improve accessibility to premium markets was assessed and the factors influencing farmers' decisions to join them were evaluated. The methodology involved a baseline survey of 213 smallholder maize producers in Bungoma district, western Kenya, plus a logit model analysis to predict the probabilities of farmers joining a cereal bank. Membership of other local community-based organizations and the actual harvests achieved strongly influence farmers' decisions to join a cereal bank.

TI  - Sugarcane Outgrowers in Ethiopia: "Forced" to Remain Poor?

AB  - Contract farming is often seen as a panacea for many of the challenges faced by agricultural production in developing countries. Given the large heterogeneity of contract farming arrangements, it is debatable whether all kinds of contract farming arrangements offer benefits to participating smallholders. Nonetheless, many donor agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and governments of developing countries are increasingly pushing for contract farming and outgrower schemes as an instrument to commercialize small-scale farming. Their desire for such arrangements is further reinforced by the recent rush for large-scale agricultural land acquisition in most developing countries, often described as "land grabbing," because contract farming and outgrower schemes can result in the same advantages as large-scale farming, but avoid its main drawback namely the displacement of the current land-users. Using data from the oldest and some more recently established sugarcane outgrower schemes in Ethiopia, this paper examines the effects of compulsory participation in sugarcane outgrower production on total household income and asset stocks. Because outgrowers and non-outgrowers may have some differences prior to joining sugarcane outgrower schemes, we use genetic matching and propensity score matching to make the two groups comparable based on their observable characteristics. Our results indicate that compulsory participation in an outgrower scheme significantly reduces the income and asset stocks of outgrowers who contributed irrigated land to the outgrower scheme, while the effect is insignificant for outgrowers who contributed rain-fed land. We provide several explanations and discuss policy implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Exploring determinants of farmers' investments in land management in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Land degradation, especially water erosion and nutrient depletion, seriously affects agricultural production in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Farmers' investments to conserve their land are until now however quite limited. The objective of this study is to identify the major factors that determine farmers' decisions how much and where to invest in land management. Exploratory factor analysis and Pearson correlation were used to analyse the data from 240 households operating 738 plots in three different production domains. The study identified five major factors that influence farmers' decisions how much to invest in land management: (1) households' resource endowments, (2) farming experience and knowledge, (3) access to information, (4) social capital and (5) availability of family labour. This result implies that extension strategies aiming at sustainable land management should try to enhance households' resources endowments and improve their access to information. Moreover, the influence of social capital and availability of family labour indicates the crucial importance of collective action in land management. Similarly, the study revealed that farmers are more willing to invest in plots that (1) are vulnerable to water erosion, (2) have better soil fertility and (3) are larger. However, the influence of these factors on farmers' investments in land management was highly variable across the considered production domains. Hence, the diversity in social, economic, cultural and biophysical conditions must be taken into account by rural extension programmes. This calls for site-specific land management strategies that can be planned and implemented at micro-level with active participation of farmers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Supermarket revolution in Asia and emerging development strategies to include small farmers
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - A "supermarket revolution" has occurred in developing countries in the past 2 decades. We focus on three specific issues that reflect the impact of this revolution, particularly in Asia: continuity in transformation, innovation in transformation, and unique development strategies. First, the record shows that the rapid growth observed in the early 2000s in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand has continued, and the "newcomers"-India and Vietnam-have grown even faster. Although foreign direct investment has been important, the roles of domestic conglomerates and even state investment have been significant and unique. Second, Asia's supermarket revolution has exhibited unique pathways of retail diffusion and procurement system change. There has been "precocious" penetration of rural towns by rural supermarkets and rural business hubs, emergence of penetration of fresh produce retail that took much longer to initiate in other regions, and emergence of Asian retail developing-country multinational chains. In procurement, a symbiosis between modern retail and the emerging and consolidating modern food processing and logistics sectors has arisen. Third, several approaches are being tried to link small farmers to supermarkets. Some are unique to Asia, for example assembling into a "hub" or "platform" or "park" the various companies and services that link farmers to modern markets. Other approaches relatively new to Asia are found elsewhere, especially in Latin America, including "bringing modern markets to farmers" by establishing collection centers and multipronged collection cum service provision arrangements, and forming market cooperatives and farmer companies to help small farmers access supermarkets.

TI  - Impact of New-Type Agricultural Cooperatives on Profitability of Rice Farms: Evidence from Vietnam's Mekong River Delta
T2  - ECONOMIES
AB  - The major goal of this study is to examine the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on the net return on production cost (ROC). The data used for the study were gathered from 233 rice farmers in the central Mekong River Delta's province of Hau Giang, Vietnam. Propensity score matching and two-step Heckman selection models were employed to account for possible selection bias stemming from systematically different observable and unobservable attributes between cooperative members and non-members. The findings reveal that cooperative membership has a positive and statistically significant impact on rice farmers' ROC, suggesting that agricultural cooperatives could help increase the profitability of rice farms.

TI  - Transforming food systems through inclusive agribusiness
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Corporations and independent experts alike consider inclusive agribusiness (LAB) instrumental to achieving sustainable and equitable development for small farmers. As businesses that productively integrate small farmers into commercial agrifood chains, IABs could help resolve some of the coordination and market and input access problems confronting many rural economies. They are therefore increasingly regarded as important private innovations to address systemic inequalities and inefficiencies within modern food systems. This article critically interrogates LAB narratives inspiring recent policy innovations. By reviewing recent LAB literature, discourse and strategies, as well as past LAB scaling experiences, it shows that LAB models such as contract farming and producer cooperatives are liable to discriminatory practices, uneven benefit capture and socio-ecological trade-offs, especially at scale. This article challenges LAB orthodoxies and the unconsidered definitions, big-business biases and value creation assumptions pervading emergent LAB policy discourse. It argues that in order for IABs to contribute to transformational change, the phenomenon deserves to be more explicitly positioned within a sustainable food systems framework. To help move the needle on LAB scholarship and policy, this article reimagines LAB along these lines. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Enhancing the application of organic fertilisers by members of agricultural cooperatives
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Scientific literature has reported that participation in agricultural cooperatives has positive effects on small farmers' preference for organic fertilisers over chemical fertilisers. However, there is limited focus on enhancing the voluntary use of organic fertilisers by small farmers who have joined an agricultural cooperative. This paper describes an agent-based model for simulating small farmers' decision-making with regard to fertiliser selection. Ninety six farmers (members) of one of the largest strawberry production cooperatives in China were assessed to understand their willingness to use different fertilisers and their socioeconomic characteristics. Simulation results showed that for farmers belonging to the agricultural cooperative who earn higher marginal profits, variations in the prices of the agricultural produce had no significant effect on their behaviour in terms of the use of organic fertilisers. The number of farmers using organic fertilisers at the beginning of the first year has a positive relationship with the increase in the rate at which farmers use organic fertilisers. However, the count does not alter the final number of farmers who use organic fertilisers after several years. Moreover, farmers' willingness to use organic fertilisers enhances the increasing speed and final number of farmers using organic fertilisers simultaneously. The design of strategies (increasing the number of farmers using organic fertilisers at the beginning of the first year and enhancing farmers' willingness to use organic fertilisers) has a significant effect on the promotion of organic fertiliser application by agricultural cooperatives in China.

TI  - The double tragedy of irrigation systems in Tamil Nadu, India: assessment of the replacement of traditional systems by private wells
T2  - WATER POLICY
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of the replacement of traditional communal irrigation systems called tanks by modern irrigation systems, that is, private wells with pumps, using a village and household data set collected in Tamil Nadu, India. Our statistical analyses find that, once the tanks deteriorate, the rice yield of farmers who have no access to wells and thus rely solely on traditional irrigation systems will decrease, whereas those of farmers with well access will not be affected. Since compensation for yield loss by income diversification is difficult, the reduction of income is so large that poverty among farmers without well access increases. Our analyses also find that, even among farmers with well access, the dissemination of private wells results in no significant increase in net return or profit of rice cultivation, presumably because the overexploitation of groundwater increases the cost of irrigation and cancels out the well users' high revenue from high yield. In this way, the replacement process creates a double tragedy: increased poverty among farmers without well access and overexploitation and profit reduction among farmers with well access. Policy options to avoid the tragedy are discussed in the concluding section.

TI  - IPM adoption, cooperative membership and farm economic performance Insight from apple farmers in China
T2  - CHINA AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on farmers' decisions to adopt integrated pest management (IPM) technology and to estimate the impact of IPM adoption on farm economic performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - An endogenous switching probit model that addresses the sample selection bias issue arising from both observed and unobserved factors is used to estimate the survey data from a sample of 481 apple households in China. A treatment effects model is employed to estimate the impact of IPM adoption on apple yields, net returns and agricultural income. In order to address the potential endogeneity associated with off-farm work variable in estimating both cooperative membership choice specification and IPM adoption specifications, a control function approach is used.
   Findings - The empirical results show that cooperative membership exerts a positive and significant impact on the adoption of IPM technology. In particular, farmers' IPM adoption decision is significantly associated with household and farm-level characteristics (e.g. education, farm size and price knowledge). IPM adoption has a positive and statistically significant impact on apple yields, net returns and agricultural income.
   Practical implications - The findings indicate that agricultural cooperatives can be a transmission route in the efforts to proliferate the adoption and diffusion of IPM technology, and increased IPM adoption tends to improve the economic performance of farm households.
   Originality/value - Despite the widespread evidence of health and environmental benefits associated with IPM technology, the adoption rate of this technology remains significantly low. This paper provides a first attempt by investigating to what extent and how agricultural cooperative membership affects IPM adoption and how IPM adoption influences farm economic performance.

TI  - Contract farming and rural transformation: Evidence from a field experiment in Benin
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - Contract farming has emerged as a popular mechanism to encourage vertical coordination in developing country agriculture. Yet, there is a lack of consensus on its ability to spur structural transformation in rural economies. We present results from a field experiment on contract farming for rice production in Benin. While all contracts have positive effects on welfare and productivity measures, we find that the simplest contract has impacts nearly as large as contracts with additional attributes. This suggests that once price risk is resolved through the offer of a fixed-price contract, farmers are able to address other constraints on their own.

TI  - Cooperatives, Politics, and Development in Rural Paraguay
T2  - HUMAN ORGANIZATION
AB  - Although national politics and policies strongly influence how cooperatives function, cooperative organizations and advisors increasingly envision cooperatives as primarily economic organizations and avoid direct political engagement and social mobilization. In this paper, we discuss and challenge the depoliticization of cooperatives based on research into how two Paraguayan cooperatives dealt with the aftermath of a debt forgiveness law for small farmers. The law was a major victory for peasant political organizations, but its benefits did not extend to all smallholders, generating discontent that threatened both cooperatives and their development strategies. The cooperatives' differing responses to these challenges underscore how policy effects and development strategies are shaped by local level decision making based on organizational histories and emergent opportunities. To conclude, we discuss the advantages and challenges of politicizing cooperatives and offer reflections on how these challenges might be overcome.

TI  - Labor Endowment, Cultivated Land Fragmentation, and Ecological Farming Adoption Strategies among Farmers in Jiangxi Province, China
T2  - LAND
AB  - A deeper understanding of the factors that influence the ecological farming adoption strategies of farmers can help in developing effective adaptation measures to mitigate the degradation of cultivated land quality and ecological degradation. This study used a stratified random sampling technique to select 1488 households in Jiangxi Province, while the double-hurdle model was used to analyze the influence of labor endowments (LEs) and cultivated land fragmentation (CLF) on ecological farming decision-making. The results indicate that LEs and CLF play important roles in farmers' decision-making with regard to ecological farming. To be more specific, the total household population and CLF have negative effects on adoption willingness, while the number of laborers has a positive effect. For the degree of adoption, the total household population has a negative effect, while the number of laborers and part-time employment have positive effects. In addition, farmers' ecological farming behavior is also influenced by factors such as education, agricultural income, cooperatives, and agricultural subsidies. Overall, farmers have a high willingness to adopt ecological farming, but the degree of actual adoption is low. This is not conducive to the promotion of ecological farming techniques and the sustainable development of agriculture in China. The study proposes that the government should further improve financial investment and provide relevant technical services. In addition, a temporary work platform should be set up for farmers to encourage them to find other work during the agricultural low season.

TI  - Can group farms outperform individual family farms? Empirical insights from India
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Is there an alternative model to small family farming that could provide sustainable livelihoods to millions of resource-constrained and often non-viable smallholders in developing countries? Could group farming constitute such an alternative, wherein smallholders voluntarily pool land, labour and capital to create larger farms that they manage collectively? In South Asia, for instance, over 85% of farmers are small and increasingly female. Potentially, group farming could provide them economies of scale, a dependable labour force, more investible funds and skills, and greater bargaining power with governments and markets. But can this potential be realised in practice? In particular, can group farms economically outperform small family farms? A rare opportunity to test this is provided by two experiments begun in the 2000s in the Indian states of Kerala and Telangana. Constituted only of women, the groups lease in land to farm collectively, sharing labour, the cost of inputs, and the returns. But the states differ in several respects, including the technical support the groups receive, and their institutional base, composition, land access and cropping patterns. Based on the author's primary sample surveys in both states, this paper compares the productivity and profitability of group farms with that of small individual family farms in the same state. Kerala's groups perform strikingly better than the predominantly male-managed individual farms, both in their annual value of output per hectare and annual net returns per farm, while in Telangana group farms perform much worse than individual farms in annual output, but are equivalent in net returns. In both states, groups do much better in commercial crops than in traditional foodgrains, where the largely male-managed individual farms, owning good quality land and with longer farm management experience, have an advantage. The factors underlying the differential performances of Kerala and Telangana, and the lessons learnt for possible replication, are also discussed. Overall, the paper demonstrates that group farming can provide an effective alternative, subject to specified conditions and adaptation of the model to the local context. (C) 2018 The Author.

TI  - Rentiers and Contractors: The Future of Agrarian Bangladesh Part 1: The Agrarian Transition since Liberation
T2  - REVIEW OF AGRARIAN STUDIES
AB  - This is the first of a two-part paper tracking agrarian change in Bangladesh, especially since its liberation in 1971. Part 1 briefly traces agrarian relations in the East Bengal delta from the Permanent Settlement in 1793, in order to establish the legacy of colonial feudalism for the social structure of the region, a legacy partially shared with West Bengal and across the Bengal Presidency more widely. This legacy of sub-infeudation via a hierarchy of revenue-collecting tenure holders and petty landlords receiving rents from occupancy tenants (the peasantry) acted as a depressor upon agricultural productivity, thus setting the conditions for food insecurity and famine. This understanding, however, is distorted by the "liberation narrative" that dominated western scholarship, of a nation of small farmers that was exploited and stayed underdeveloped during the Pakistan period. This small farmer narrative was aided by action-research during the 1960s that started a programme of small farmer cooperatives in the Dhaka-Cumilla belt, a region of high soil fertility, a dense population, with minifundist or small farm holdings. In order to enhance food security post-liberation, the intent of the state was to extend the small farmer model to the rest of the country. This approach ignored the emerging evidence of the capture of cooperatives by the rich, as it did the larger context of quasi-feudalism and widespread landlessness in rural Bangladesh. The paper introduces the notion of "squared fragmentation" with plots, not just land area, divided between inheriting sons, inhibiting consolidation and thereby also inhibiting methods to optimise new technologies, especially mechanisation and the introduction of new, higher-yielding rice varieties (irri-boro). These conditions set the scene for the intrusion of capital into agriculture via contract farming, opening up the possibility of landholders becoming rentiers on plots operated by other stakeholders rather than themselves becoming commercial farmers. This proposition is explored further in Part 2, suggesting that Bangladesh represents a distinctive model of agrarian reform in contrast to more familiar land reform measures elsewhere in the subcontinent.

TI  - Does agricultural cooperative membership help reduce the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides? Evidence from rural China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - The overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides (CFPs) has negatively impacted the environment and human health. It is an urgent issue that should be addressed. In this study, we investigate whether agricultural cooperatives can serve as an institutional arrangement that helps reduce the consumption of CFPs, using the data of 2012 family farms from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China. Various approaches, including instrumental variable-based two-stage residual inclusion approach (2SRI), endogenous switching probit (ESP) model, and endogenous switching regression (ESR) model, are utilized to help address the endogeneity issues of the cooperative membership variable. The results show that agricultural cooperative membership significantly increases the probability of reducing fertilizers and pesticides of the family farms and improves net return per yuan CFPs. The further analysis shows that agricultural cooperative production services reduced the usage of fertilizers and pesticides, while cooperatives marketing services only significantly lowered the use of pesticides. Our findings highlight the importance of promoting the development of agricultural cooperatives to support green agricultural production in China.

TI  - Nobody farms here anymore: Livelihood diversification in the Amazonian community of Carvao, a historical perspective
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB  - Over the past 15 years income sources in the Amazonian community of Carvao have diversified to include government salaries, retirement and welfare benefits, and wages from an evolving informal service sector. These non-farm incomes are now more important to household incomes than the sale of agricultural products. Out of 80 households only three families were found to depend almost entirely on the sale of agricultural goods for cash income. Agriculture is still a part of most families' livelihoods; however, production today is mainly a subsistence activity. Recent changes in Carvao are consistent with trends of livelihood diversification observed in rural societies across the globe. However, current research reveals that Carvao is different from other case studies in a number of ways. A history of livelihoods illustrates that residents in Carvao have always engaged in a range of activities, including farming, extractive activities, and wage labor. New incomes are the result of new jobs in the public sector and social policies benefiting the rural poor. In contrast to the literature on livelihood diversification, the decentralization of the federal government in Brazil has resulted in greater opportunities for rural income and employment. Consistent with recorded trends, research shows that small farmers in Carvao have down-sized agricultural production. Farmers cite low market prices (the result of vertical integration of local markets) as one cause of this decline. Residents, especially small farmers, interested in diversifying agricultural production are limited by inadequate extension services and credit, and younger residents seek public sector employment. Income diversification has increased livelihoods security; however, future livelihoods will depend on new economic growth. Given the stagnating public sector and a weak industrial sector, production geared toward growing urban markets is a viable means for further income generation in Carvao.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF EFFICIENCY CONSTRAINTS USING COBB-DOUGLASS PRODUCTION FUNCTION IN SNAIL (Archachatina marginata) PRODUCTION BY SMALL FARMERS IN CROSS RIVER STATE, NIGERIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS
AB  - This study examined constraints militating against the profitability potentials of snail (Archachatina marginata) production by small-scale snail farmers in Cross River State, Nigeria. Data were obtained from a random sample of 120 respondents in the study area by means of structured and semi-structured questionnaire. The first stage involved random selection of three local government areas from (Ogoja, Ikom and Odukpani) eighteen local government areas in Cross River State, Nigeria. This was followed by random selection of three villages (Igoli in Ogoja Local Government Area, Alesi in Ikom Local Government Area and Adiabo in Odukpani Local Government Area) in Cross River State. Fourty (40) respondents were randomly selected from each of the villages. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics and costs-returns analysis. The results indicated that Cobb-Douglas production function had the best fit in explaining the relationship between output of snail and inputs used, the coefficient of multiple determinant (R-2=0.60 indicates that sixty percent of the variability in output of snail is explained by the independent variables). Results from the analysis revealed that the marginal value products of farm size, labour, farm management practices and operating costs were N1081, N20.6, N972.8, N14.84 respectively, there existed allocative in-efficiency, there is a high potential for snail farmers to increase their yields and income. Further analysis of results revealed that net returns on snail is N2,935,000.00 with return on every naira invested of N0.14 is also positive indicating a profit from the business, with attractive net return on investment. This study shows that snail farmers are faced with several problems in their production activities. These problems or constraints affect the efficiency of snail production in the study area. Notable among them are high cost of feed supplement, lack of capital, inaccessibility of formal credit source due to lack of collaterals, lack of extension agents, lack of medication/vaccines, poor production infrastructures and lack of good farm management practices occupied 15%, 14.17%, 11.67%, 10%, 9.17%, 9.17% and 8.33%, respectively. The constraints associated with the business as highlighted in this paper if tackled could pave a way to increase profit and this will reduce poverty in Cross River State. Hence, for efficient production of snail in the study area, these constraints must be reduced. This can be done through efficient policy formulation and implementation, proper supervision of snail production programme, effective extension services and proper agricultural financing. Snail farmers in the study area should be trained by extension agents on how to control some of constraints that militate against the profitability potential of snail production. Beside that snail farmers should form cooperative group(s) in order to obtain loans from bank(s) to increase their capital base for higher output.

TI  - Brown Rice Market Chain and Marketing Practices, Luzon, Philippines
T2  - PHILIPPINE AGRICULTURAL SCIENTIST
AB  - The study involved an analysis of the brown rice market in selected provinces of Luzon, Philippines. Brown rice comprised a small portion of the rice market with 10 producers included in the study, having an annual output of approximately 397 metric tons only. The market chain consisted of producers, market intermediaries and consumers. Scale of production varied considerably, from small individual farmers to large cooperatives. The market chains were relatively simple involving at most two market intermediaries, i.e., the wholesaler/distributors and the retailers. Big producers were linked to markets via established and extensive marketing networks of NGOs while the small ones sold to households within their respective localities. Value-addition in the form of grading/quality control, re-packaging, labeling or delivery to higher-level markets was done mainly by those who carried a brand name or sold in established wholesale and retail markets. Such value-addition provided financial incentives as reflected in the price increase through the chain. Except for one, the market participants earned positive net returns, given the current scale of operation and market capacity. Estimated monthly consumption of brown rice was low at 6.75 kg per household. Non-use or discontinued use of brown rice was due to its high price, not being readily available, poor eating quality and the limited information about it among consumers. Constraints in the supply chain were related to the lack of drying facility for palay (paddy rice) during unpredictable weather conditions, lack of rice mills specifically designed for brown rice and the limited local market for small producers.

TI  - Peru: agroecological movement history 1980-2015
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - The Peruvian agroecological movement has been strongly shaped by civil society organizations, organized ecological small farmers, market opportunities, academia, and key political advocacy actions. Collectively organized responses with a high degree of self-learning have encouraged a favorable regulatory framework for organic farming, the valuation of our biodiversity, and the recognition of small-scale farmers as a key source of local food. The agroecological movement has grown in learning, organization, and social impact while facing new challenges that need to be solved.

TI  - Civil Society in Hybrid Governance: Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) Legitimacy in Mediating Wal-Mart's Local Produce Supply Chains in Honduras
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This paper challenges the notion that the incorporation of actors from civil society into hybrid governance arrangements improves outcomes and legitimacy. Multi-stakeholder collaborations are a popular hybrid governance approach to development, including NGOs' work to integrate smallholder farmers into supermarket supply chains. As a result, NGOs' service provision role has expanded to include market facilitation, often necessitating NGOs act as market intermediaries. This paper explores how this new role may jeopardize NGOs' organizational legitimacy in the eyes of their constituents, other development organizations, and supermarket partners, and therefore ultimately affect their ability to represent civil society in hybrid governance arrangements. Drawing on qualitative data collected in the Central American country of Honduras, this paper focuses on NGOs' role organizing producer associations to facilitate access to Wal-Mart supermarkets. Findings suggest that a lack of supply chain transparency, NGOs' negotiation between commercial and aid-oriented goals, and the potential to exclude producers from development projects threaten NGOs' legitimacy. These findings illustrate the difficulties of embedding philanthropic activities in market-based systems, and demonstrate how multi-stakeholder collaborations may be influenced more by commercial priorities than the elements of a partnership. Ultimately, development NGOs are products of neoliberal, hybrid governance, even as their activities are expected to ease the transition of small-scale producers into this system.

TI  - GENDERED LIVELIHOOD IMPLICATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS OF LIVESTOCK WATER PRODUCTIVITY IN ZIMBABWE
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
AB  - Scarcity lack of access, and ineffective and inefficient use of water in Nkayi District, Zimbabwe, threaten agricultural production. The purpose of this study is to augment understanding of opportunities to increase livestock water productivity (IMP) in Nkayi District by taking into account key differences in the capacities, opportunities, and needs of women and men. There are two important types of female-headed households, de facto and de jure. The results from this study showed that male-headed and de facto and de jure female-headed households share much in common. They all had similar areas of cropland and access to education, finances, veterinary and extension services, and transportation and markets. Households of all types had similar herd sizes. All were desperately poor with incomes much less than a dollar a clay To rise out of poverty the knowledge, skills and effort of all household heads will be needed. In spite of severe poverty household heads of all types are literate and have sufficient education that can help enable adoption of intervention options that can lead to increased agricultural production and improved livelihoods. The results also showed that major differences exist in terms of the roles of men and women in ownership, management and decision making related to livestock keeping and animal production. Men clearly dominate in both ownership and decision making even though women play a major role in animal management. Only in de jure female-headed households were women more likely than men to own cattle and goats. They were also more likely to be involved in farming as a primary livelihood activity Surprisingly, men were more likely to be involved in animal management in these de jure female-headed households. Women were also excluded from water users' and livestock producers' associations although a minority of men was members. By not involving the already-developed capacity of women, the community loses our on a significant opportunity to increase LWP and animal production more widely Greater inclusion of women in decision making will be an important part of future efforts to improve livelihoods through livestock development.

TI  - Small Farmers Large Field (SFLF): a synchronized collective action model for improving the livelihood of small farmers in India
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - This study pilots the collective action model "Small Farmers Large Field (SFLF)" to overcome the disadvantages faced by millions of small and marginal farmers due to diseconomies of scale and lack of bargaining power in the supply chain. This model is participatory and flexible and allows small farmers to benefit from achieving economies of scale by organizing themselves into groups and synchronizing and harmonizing selected operations. It was piloted in two villages of Odisha, an eastern Indian state, with 112 farmers (35 females and 77 males). These farmers organized themselves into groups and synchronized their operations such as nursery bed management, transplanting, and harvesting collectively to achieve economies of scale. The SFLF farmers purchased inputs (seed and fertilizer) and sold paddy as a group to increase their bargaining power in price negotiations. The results from this pilot study showed that the participating farmers almost doubled their profits. Apart from the monetary benefits, these farmers saved time in many joint activities, including input (seed and fertilizer) purchase, paddy sale, and nursery bed management. Other important benefits of the harmonization and synchronization of farming operations were social harmony and sustainability of the farming system.

TI  - Supporting Smallholders to Access Sustainable Supply Chains: Lessons from the Indian Cotton Supply Chain
T2  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - A significant number of different sustainable initiatives have emerged to improve sustainability and inclusion of small farmers in global supply chains. These include production process adjustment advice and implementation of different sustainable product standards. In practice two different approaches are taken. Development projects focus on enabling farmers to adjust their practices to Organic, Fairtrade and other standards requirements. In international trade, buyers from developed countries implement separate supply chain assurance systems. This article presents nine case studies of practices from both approaches in the cotton supply chain in India. The results show improvements in the livelihoods of small farmers but increased market access depends on what approaches are used. The future challenge is to combine the different approaches, creating market links and enhancing supply chain efficiency while providing development support at community levels. With such a balance it will be possible to assure project sustainability and maximize long-term economical, environmental and social benefits.

TI  - Small farm systems to feed hungry Asia
T2  - OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB  - Small farms are an integral part of Asian agriculture. They are characterized by the preponderance and emphasis on mixed crop-animals systems across a variety of agroecological zones. Mixed farming is the backbone of agriculture, many categories of which are models of diversification, efficiency and resilience in Asia. In global terms, small farms in Asia account for an estimated 87% of all farms of under two hectares of land. About 52% of these farms have < 1 ha, with the smallest sizes (0.3-0.6 ha) being found in China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. There are three types of small farms: in irrigated areas, rainfed zones and plantation agriculture. The first category greatly benefited from policy support and massive resource inputs through the 'green revolution', while the second was bypassed by it, but continues to produce the bulk of the ruminant meats and milk. The third type remains neglected. The rural poor are mainly small farmers and landless agricultural labourers; their characteristics are described in detail. Irrespective of their various definitions, the key descriptors are deprivation, subsistence, illiteracy, survival, and because of globalization, vulnerability. Data from various sources indicate some key features concerning Asian agriculture: about 83% of the agricultural area is rainfed; between 51% and 55% of the total population of cattle and goats is found here; and about 59-60% of poor livestock keepers are found on mixed farms. The development of small farms in rainfed environments is a priority for the future and affirmative action is imperative. The strategies for development include the promotion of animal production as the entry point for food production and total factor productivity; integrated use of natural resources; improved feeding and nutrition; interdisciplinary, participatory and holistic approaches to address system constraints; and strengthening access to information and delivery systems. Effective policies are urgently required to spur this initiative; these should include development policy for small farm systems; intensifying the role of animals in integrated systems; improved rural-urban marketing linkages, infrastructure and communications. The development pathways include needs-based intensification of animal production systems; improving diversification with the appropriate mix of animals that can be integrated with annual and perennial crops; ensuring access to improved technologies and markets; strengthening empowerment; promotion of cooperatives and agri-business; and sustained pro-poor initiatives to reduce poverty and hunger that are consistent with income growth, socioeconomic benefits, improved livelihoods and self-reliance.

TI  - Small-scale cooperative banking and the production of capital: Reflecting on the role of institutional agreements in supporting rural livelihood in Kampot, Cambodia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper explores the ecological economics of small-scale cooperative banking (SSCB) through reference to the empirical case of a rice-farming village in Kampot, Cambodia. It combines Georgescu-Roegen's discussion of an economy's capacity to produce economic processes with Ostrom's concept of institutional performance, in order to address the implications and functioning of SSCB within a small-farmer economy. The local collective action situation of maintaining and making use of a SSCB system - a specific finance model - provides the studied community with access to a pooled capital fund that may play an important role in ensuring its capacity to produce and reproduce economic processes, according to its own specifications. The coordinated action among the villagers, which matches up well with Ostrom's criteria for effective institutional performance of common pool resource use governance, is found to include social and environmental dimensions, which we understand to be necessary for achieving transformations toward more sustainable economic activity. While we do not wish to suggest that the adoption of SSCB guarantees either improved ecological or social impacts, our results suggest that this finance model could play a supporting role in enhancing the potential of small-farming communities to improve both, should they wish to do so.

TI  - Green economy, degradation narratives, and land-use conflicts in Tanzania
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The implementation of the green economy in Tanzania is currently re-arranging space in significant ways. The Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT) has been presented by the government as well as investors and aid donors as a model for the green economy in Africa combining investments in large-scale farming with environmental conservation. The Kilombero valley is centrally situated within SAGCOT and has become a national hotspot of land-use conflicts. The valley is dominated by an expanding sector of agricultural capital investments combined with a substantial increase in areas under environmental conservation. While some smallholder farmers are dispossessed through these expansions, others are contracted as outgrowers. Pastoralists are, however, only in the way, and are also thought to cause widespread environmental degradation. This is a long-held view, which also plays a key role in the implementation of SAGCOT. It has led to a series of pastoral evictions in the country. In 2012, 'Operation Save Kilombero' was implemented consisting of violent evictions of all pastoralists from the valley. This eviction had been planned to conserve the wetland ecosystem that was seen by the government and aid donors to be threatened by pastoral overstocking. The arrival of the green economy in Kilombero re-enforced the perceived need to clear the valley of livestock and pastoralists to conserve the environment and make space for investments in agriculture. The pastoral eviction in Kilombero in 2012 was also only one in a series; every eviction leading to the spill-over of pastoralists to other areas creating new farmer-herder conflicts as well as conservation conflicts. While land-use conflicts in Africa are commonly thought to be caused by natural resource scarcity and environmental degradation mainly resulting from population growth, we demonstrate how degradation narratives may themselves be a key driver of conflicts, in this case to legitimize and pave the way for agricultural investments and environmental conservation under a 'green economy'.

TI  - Combine harvesting efficiency as affected by rice field size and other factors and its implication for adoption of combine contracting service
T2  - PLANT PRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB  - Small combine harvesters have become popular in SE Asia recently, but small rice fields appear to limit its field operation and hence its wide adoption by smallholders. Combine harvesting efficiency, the area of paddy field harvested per unit time, was determined for 6 seasons in Central Lao PDR for over 400 fields varying in size and toposequence position, rice varieties grown, crop establishment methods and crop conditions particularly lodging at harvest. Combine harvesting efficiency was commonly about 3 ha/day in small fields of less than 1000 m(2) and increased with the increase in field size up to 5 ha/day in the size of about 2000-3000 m(2), but not beyond this range. Lower efficiency was also found in wet season than dry season, and also crops established from broadcasting compared with transplanting and drill seeding, at least partly because broadcasted crops tended to lodge more often than crops established from other methods. Photoperiod sensitive, long duration varieties grown in lower field positions also tended to have lower combine efficiency. Using the data obtained in this work, net return of combine adoption to farmers was estimated for different combine charge fees and yield levels. Increasing combine harvesting efficiency by 50% with increased field size would increase the net income of combine harvesting contractors by around 50% at current charges, allowing them to reduce the combine harvesting fees they charge. This would aid the adoption of combine harvesting services.

TI  - Economic reform and repeasantization in post-1990 Cuba
T2  - LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH REVIEW
AB  - In the early 1990s Cuba initiated a new phase of social transformation, driven forward by an economic reform. Some aspects of that reform resembled orthodox structural adjustment, while others differed from it. In agriculture the reform reshaped state farms into multiple cooperatives, subdivided cooperative production, liberalized produce markets, and ceded land to individual parceleros. Through interviews with policy makers and cooperative leaders, and a survey of small farmers in western and eastern Cuba, I examined the reform's impact on small farmers' production. I found that two important patterns characterized the 1990s: first, "repeasantization" occurred; and second, income disparities between these two regions were maintained, if not expanded. Yet, even in poorer regions, small farmers are modestly better off than the average salary earner, while in other regions they are substantially better off. In sum, Cuba's economic crisis forced the reshaping of agricultural policy in ways that fortified the position of small farmers.

AB  - Fair trade is an alternative production and trading network offering market opportunities to small scale farmers in I context of globalisation and liberalisation. This case study of olive oil in Morocco confronts theoretical principles of fair trade with producers realities of the "Femmes du Rif," Fair trade benefits are heterogeneous. Both the integration of small farmers into higher value added marketing channels and revenue for women are improved. Fair trade facilitates women's social participation and enhances the legitimacy of the organization. Public Support, however, is a key factor for capacity, building. Future research is needed to assess long term impacts in order to improve fair trade benefits for small farmers.

TI  - Perishability and market power in Nepalese food crop production
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This study provides empirical evidence for the relation between perishability in vertically coordinated supply chains and the market power exercised over smallholders in Nepal. Using survey data from small-scale farms of tomatoes, ginger, high-yielding variety paddy seeds, and lentils, we demonstrate how varying levels of perishability affect the degree of market power exercised by contractors and in cooperative farming. We show how much value-added is diverted from farmers, compared to the benchmark set by the least perishable good. Results indicate that more perishable crops are subject to a greater degree of market power. A subsequent scenario analysis reveals that the redistributive effects of market power based on crop perishability are substantial: smallholders' farm profitability increase by 18% as crop perishability is reduced by 50%. We conclude by discussing policy measures to reduce power imbalances due to crop perishability.

TI  - Macro-Economic and Product Challenges Facing Vietnamese the Pangasius Industry
T2  - REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE & AQUACULTURE
AB  - Vietnamese pangasius achieved global status as a highly competitive whitefish as exports to Europe, United States, Asian, and Latin American countries have grown at a rapid pace. Accelerated growth rates have met with a number of challenges that can be potentially converted to opportunities to foster further progress and expansion in exports. This study is a review of literature that examines the various economic and market issues facing the industry in the EU market. The review suggests that at the domestic level farmers must be organized alongside vertical integration to improve quality and supply consistency. Vertical integration may help reduce farm operating costs and increase farmer profit. High interest rates, fluctuating exchange rates, access to credit, lack of capital acquisition by small farmers, and product risks are key economic issues confronting the industry, whereas product quality and standards, product image, and rejection pose financial pressure on farmers, processors, and exporters. The fish, pangasius competes well in the white fish market and key product characteristics are well suited to vertical integration and horizontal differentiation in various and diverse EU markets. The industry may employ a combination of vertical and mixed product differentiation for improved product image and market share expansion in the EU white fish market.

TI  - Cotton and textiles industries in Tanzania: the failures of liberalisation
T2  - REVIEW OF AFRICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB  - This article uses the story of cotton cultivation in Tanzania to analyse critically the processes of liberalisation and expose the failure of markets to reward quality production. It starts by summarising the technological requirements to grow the crop. It then shows how cotton was central to industrialisation, in Britain and elsewhere. In Tanzania, cotton is grown on small farms and so the article then summarises how small farmers make choices and minimise risks. This creates the context for outline histories, first of cotton growing, and then of textile industries in Tanzania, before turning to the impact of structural adjustment and liberalisation in the late 1980s and 1990s which led to increases in production but losses in quality and price. The article draws conclusions from this about the role of agriculture in processes of economic transformation and the need for institutions which represent the economic interests of small farmers.

TI  - Global Retail Chains and Poor Farmers: Evidence from Madagascar
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Global retail companies ("supermarkets") have an increasing influence on developing countries, through foreign investments and/or through the imposition of their private standards. The impact on developing countries and poverty is often assessed as negative. In this paper we show the opposite, based on an analysis of primary data collected to measure the impact of supermarkets on small contract farmers in Madagascar, one of the poorest countries in the world. Almost 10,000 farmers in the Highlands of Madagascar produce vegetables for supermarkets in Europe. In this global supply chain, small farmers' micro-contracts are combined with intensive farm assistance and supervision programs to fulfill complex quality requirements and phyto-sanitary standards of supermarkets. Small farmers that participate in these contracts have higher welfare, more income stability and shorter lean periods. We also find significant effects on improved technology adoption, better resource management and spillovers on the productivity of the staple crop rice. The small but emerging modern retail sector in Madagascar does not (yet) deliver these benefits as they do not (yet) request the same high standards for their supplies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Factors affecting farmers' decision to enter agricultural cooperatives using random utility model in the South Eastern Anatolian Region of Turkey
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE TROPICS AND SUBTROPICS
AB  - Farmers' decision and perceptions to be a member of agricultural cooperatives in the South Eastern Anatolian Region were investigated. Factors affecting the probability of joining the agricultural cooperatives were determined using binary logit model. The model released that most of variables such as education, high communication, log of gross income, farm size, medium and high technology variables play important roles in determining the probability of entrance. Small farmers are likely expected to join the agricultural cooperatives than the wealthier farmers are. Small farmers may wish to benefit cash at hand, input subsidies, and services provided by the agricultural cooperatives since the risks associated with intensive high-returning crops are high. Some important factors playing pole role in abstention of farmers towards agricultural cooperatives are gross income and some social status variables. In addition, conservative or orthodox farmers are less likely to join agricultural cooperatives than moderate farmers are. We also found that the direct government farm credit programs mainly should be objected to providing farmers to better access to capital markets and creating the opportunity to use with allocation of capital inputs via using modern technology.

TI  - Risk takers, risk makers: Small farmers and non-traditional agro-exports in Kenya and Costa Rica
T2  - HUMAN ORGANIZATION
AB  - This article examines the effects of small farmers' competitive strategies on production relations in the non-traditional agro-export sector of the developing world. It uses a comparative case study approach involving cases with different commodity, institutional, and socio-historical features: one involving snow pea production in Kenya, the other involving chayote production in Costa Rica. Despite the contrasting characteristics of each case, small fanners in both areas responded to production and marketing risks by utilizing alternative markets. These strategies, however, decreased their ability to guarantee supply and quality to agro-export firms, which compelled such firms to develop alternative production arrangements that side-stepped small farmers. The findings reveal the limitations of non-traditional agro-export production as a rural development strategy. They also call into question the value of certain strategies as risk-reduction mechanisms for small farmers.

TI  - Vertical coordination and farm performance: evidence from the catfish sector in Vietnam
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Using an original dataset from the Vietnamese catfish sector, I analyze the impact of vertical coordination options, namely, contract farming and vertical integration, on farm performance, which is measured in terms of yields and revenue per hectare. The effects of vertical coordination are estimated using a maximum simulated likelihood estimator and a two-stage least square regression with instrumental variables to account for endogenous farm and household characteristics and selection on unobservable characteristics. The results show that vertically integrated farms have substantially higher yields and revenue per hectare than nonintegrated farms. The levels of gains that can be attributed to integration are large and consistent under different estimation procedures, and there is no difference between nonintegrated and contract farms in terms of farm performance.

TI  - Adoption of climate-smart agriculture technology in drought-prone area of India - implications on farmers' livelihoods
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose Laser land leveling (LLL) is a climate-smart technology that improves water use efficiency and reduces risk in crop cultivation due to weather variability. Hence, this technology is useful for cultivating water-intensive crops in a sustainable way. Given this background, the state government of Karnataka initiated to promote LLL in drought-prone districts and selected Raichur district for implementation. Moreover, farmers in this district had observed drought situation during monsoon paddy growing season in 2018. Therefore, this study attempts to investigate the importance of LLL technology for paddy cultivation under drought conditions. Design/methodology/approach A primary survey with 604 farmer households had been conducted in Raichur in 2018. Among them, 50% are adopters of LLL who have been selected purposively and rest 50% are non-adopters who have grown paddy in the adjacent or nearest plot of the laser-leveled plot. The adoption and causal impact of LLL has been estimated using propensity score matching, coarsened exact matching and endogenous switching regression methods. Findings The result reveals a positive and significant impact of LLL on paddy yield and net returns to the farmers. The results indicate an increment of 12 and 16% in rice yield and net income, respectively, for LLL adopters in comparison to the non-adopters of LLL. Research limitations/implications The major limitation of the study is that it does not adopt the method of experimental study due to certain limitations; hence, the authors employed a quasi-experimental method to look at the possible impact of adoption of LL. Originality/value There have been various agronomic studies focusing on the ex-ante assessment of the LLL. This study is an ex-post assessment of the technology on the crop yield and farmers' income in a dry semi-arid region of India, which, according to the authors, is the first in this approach.

TI  - Partial Vertical Integration, Risk Shifting, and Product Rejection in the High-Value Export Supply Chain: The Ghana Pineapple Sector
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - High-value export supply chains hold potential to improve smallholders' welfare, but their relative production inefficiency and moral hazard problems can cause exporters to prefer vertically integrated plantation production. However, pineapple exporters in Ghana produce both for their own account and purchase from smallholders. We hypothesize that vertical integration is only partial because exporters face large market risks that smallholders, surprisingly, are better able to absorb. We show empirically that exporters' average rejection rate of export-quality fruit is high and varies in response to unanticipated fluctuations in European demand. These results support the hypothesis and are consistent with theories of partial vertical integration but not the standard principal-agent paradigm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of fodder biomass yield of hydroponically-grown barley and oats and the effects on intake, digestibility and weight gain of Washera sheep when fed as a supplement to a basal diet of natural pasture hay in Ethiopia
T2  - TROPICAL GRASSLANDS-FORRAJES TROPICALES
AB  - The feasibility of using hydroponically-grown (HGF) barley and oats forage as a supplement to natural pasture hay (PH) for sheep-feeding was investigated. Twenty-five intact Washera male lambs were used in both a 90 day feeding trial and a 10 day digestibility study. The treatments compared were: 100% PH (control, = T1); PH + a concentrate mix (CM) (= T2); PH + HGF barley (= T3); PH + HGF oats (= T4); and PH + 50% CM and 50% HGF mixture of barley and oats (= T5). Chemical composition of diets and refusals, feed intake and digestibility of DM and nutrients were recorded. The average HGF fresh biomass yields from 1 kg grain were 5.21 and 6.32 kg for barley and oats, respectively. The CP, NDF, ADF and ADL concentrations in HGF were 13.2, 45.6, 34.8 and 6.7% for barley and 13.7, 46.8, 36.6 and 7.6% for oats. All supplemented treatments had higher total DM intakes (12-21%) than the control (P<0.05) and all supplements produced marked substitution effects for PH (35-51%). Animals on the PH diet lost weight (17 g/d), while all supplemented groups gained weight (58-65 g/d). Partial budget analysis showed that the highest net return was for T5 followed by T2, T4 and T3. Hydroponically-grown oats forage could have potential to replace a commercial concentrate for supplementing sheep on native pastures, but both HGF and concentrates are probably unaffordable for the majority of smallholder farmers engaged in sheep production. Establishment of farmer cooperative hydroponic facilities could spread the overhead costs of the capital infrastructure and this approach should be investigated.

TI  - Marketing cooperative vs. commission agent: The Turkish dilemma on the modern fresh fruit and vegetable market
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - In Turkey, the Wholesale Markets Law was enacted in 1995 to facilitate small-scale growers' access to the fresh produce market. Cooperatives and commission agents have thus become the main marketing structures available to small-scale fresh produce growers, to supply supermarkets and comply with their new requirements. In this paper, we question the advantages and disadvantages that confront small farmers with respect to those marketing structures to allow for market matching or quality upgrading. Drawing on ownership and transaction cost arguments, we use an analytical framework to identify and compare the costs of these marketing organizations. Based on data collected through a large number of interviews with stakeholders, we show that commission agents and credit cooperatives tend to be more efficient than traditional cooperatives as regards sales performance and decision costs. However, the lack of apparent competition between commission agents does not allow for sufficient provision of incentives for producers to invest in high-quality production. Consequently, credit cooperatives are the only structure progressively turning to strategies of quality upgrading and supermarket supply. The flipside of such strategies is that they may lead to the marginalization of small-scale farmers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Vertical coordination and cooperative member benefits: Case studies of four dairy farmers' cooperatives in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Agricultural cooperatives have grown exponentially in the past few decades. There is anecdotal evidence showing that vertical coordination of cooperatives with upstream and downstream supply chain bring benefits to cooperative members; however this relationship is far from clear. In particular, the common measurements for member benefits may not accurately represent cooperative practice in the literature. To fill this gap and using an ethnographic multiple case study method, 32 interviews were carried out with four dairy cooperatives in China. It is found that (1) there is a linear relationship between vertical coordination and cooperative performance; (2) Vertical coordination is associated with benefits distribution within the dairy cooperative, showing an inverted U-shaped relationship; (3) Member benefits are a function of both cooperative performance and benefits distribution.

TI  - Is There Too Much Hype about Index-based Agricultural Insurance?
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - Individual crop insurance has been largely abandoned in developing countries and replaced by insurance pilots based on weather indices. These pilot schemes have encountered low demand. Research suggests that better-off farmers may already be insured via income diversification, their assets and social networks, and may achieve profit-maximising portfolios without formal insurance contracts. They would be interested in such contracts only if they reliably reduced their exposure to risk at lower costs than their self-insurance mechanisms. Conversely, poor farmers are not able to sell-insure adequately, have to trade-off returns for reduced risk and could, therefore, benefit from a well-designed insurance. But they are cash/credit constrained and, therefore, cannot advance the money before sowing time to buy insurance that pays Out only after the harvest. Index insurance, therefore, cannot be scaled up. Even if a few farmers purchase it, governments still will need to run relief programmes far the uninsured. Standard ways suggested to improve the index insurance, such as reducing basis risks, educating farmers and improving weather data, do not improve the ability of small farmers to purchase insurance and may not improve product design sufficiently to be competitive with self-insurance of the better-off farmers.

TI  - Organization model, vertical integration, and farmers' income growth: Empirical evidence from large-scale farmers in Lin'an, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Since China's reform and opening-up in 1978, the income of rural residents has increased when compared with that of urban residents. However, the income growth rate of farmers is relatively low, and the income gap between urban and rural areas is widening. Using a sample of 1,325 large-scale farming households in Lin'an, this study constructs a theoretical path for how the level of vertical integration and an organization model affect farmers' income levels and empirically tests the path using a mediation effect analysis model. The results indicate that organization models and vertical integration are important factors that affect farmers' income levels. The total income and agricultural operation income of farmers who participate in agricultural operation organizations are greater than that of farmers who do not participate in an operation organization. In addition, the total income and agricultural operation income of farmers who produce and process and those who produce, process, and sell are higher than those of farmers who only produce. A farmers' organization model has both a direct and an indirect positive influence on their income level, with the indirect positive influence coming through the mediating variable of vertical integration. The application of the organizational model can promote the growth of rural households' total family income and agricultural income by 13.48% and 14.48% respectively, consisting of direct increases of 9.67% and 10.19%, and indirect increases of 3.81% and 4.29% through vertical integration. The results also show that access to credit, agricultural technology training, and the farmer's education level have significant positive impacts on farming income levels. The findings suggest ways to increase farmers' income by perfecting agricultural management organization systems, promoting agricultural industrialization, strengthening rural financial support, improving agricultural technical training for farmers, and increasing their level of education.

TI  - Are farmer producer companies ready to behave as business entities? Insights from the vegetable-based farmer companies in West Bengal, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Farmer producer companies are seen as an institutional arrangement to provide market access and sustainable livelihood to small farmers. In India, more than 4,200 producer organizations were registered over the last 8-10 years to mobilize millions of farmers to enhance their income through collective action. However, most of these organizations are at an early stage of establishing themselves amidst several hurdles. This study attempted to understand the challenges faced by the farmer producer companies (a type of producer organization) with the help of primary data collected through interviews of the CEOs of 36 such companies in West Bengal, India. The study also analyzed the issues concerning developing a supply-chain by producer companies with institutional buyers based on a real-time experiment, which involved examining the process of supply of vegetables to a bulk purchaser. The study found a lack of trust and awareness among the farmers to be significant hurdles to form producer companies. Inadequate training, inept management, and poor organizational skills of the members challenge the functioning of such companies. Further, some of the inadequacies in the supply-chain of a producer company, as found in the experiment, can be improved by the coordinated use of technology, training, and planning.

AB  - Despite more than a decade of NGO and government activities promoting developing world farmer participation in high-value agricultural markets, evidence regarding the household welfare effects of such initiatives is limited. This article analyzes the geographic placement of supermarket supply chains in Nicaragua between 2000 and 2008 and uses a difference-in-differences specification on measures of supplier and nonsupplier assets to estimate the welfare effects of small farmer participation. Though results indicate that selling to supermarkets increases household productive asset holdings, they also suggest that only farmers with advantageous endowments of geography and water are likely to participate.

TI  - What are the Determinants of Large-scale Farming in China?
T2  - CHINA & WORLD ECONOMY
AB  - The Chinese Government has increased its focus on expanding farm scale to promote agricultural development since 2010. A series of favorable polices has been adopted to support large-scale farming. Using a multivariate probit model and 2015 and 2016 rural household survey data, the present paper examines the factors that influence small farmers' decision to become large-scale farmers. The empirical regression results suggest that the decision to become a large-scale farmer is significantly influenced by household human capital, cooperative membership, marketing channels, land-transfer contracts and government policies. However, the influence of these factors differs with respect to becoming large-scale grain and non-grain farmers. These results imply that policy tools should target these factors and the appropriate group of small-scale farmers. Generally, both central and local governments should promote large-scale farming by enhancing rural households' human capital, improving marketing channels and providing agricultural social services, as well as encouraging returning migrant workers to engage in large-scale farming.

TI  - An Assessment of Potato Contract Farming in West Bengal State, India
T2  - POTATO RESEARCH
AB  - This paper assessed the system of contract farming in potato cultivation in the state of West Bengal, India, by comparing the production of potatoes under noncontract and contractual systems. The data were collected from 139 noncontract and 144 contract farmers spread over 13 blocks of four districts of the state during the year 2008. The results indicated that no government functionary was involved in the contract farming arrangement and that the agreements were largely verbal. Vendors were appointed by the company; they managed the total affairs for a group of villages. Although the price was fixed well before planting, it was not fixed uniformly across the state. Contract farmers planted more seed per hectare than noncontract farmers and used relatively more seed from their own seed stock. The number of agricultural assets per household was higher in contract farmers. Further, it was found that the cost of cultivation was higher for cv. Atlantic as compared to cv. K. Jyoti. The major costs were those for planting, fertilizers and micronutrients, irrigation and land preparation for both cultivars. Farmers without contracts incurred losses but contract farmers growing cv. Atlantic received net returns of about INR15,000 (EUR 238) per hectare. Lack of remunerative price, bad seed quality, occurrence of late blight, expensive seed and labour shortage were the major constraints faced by the noncontract farmers. The contract farmers also experienced many problems like high cost of cultivation, late blight infestation, low yield, lack of clear contract agreement and difficulties in disposing off the leftover potatoes. The findings suggest an involvement of the local government, a uniform fixation of the price throughout the state, written and clear agreements and development of good dual purpose (processing as well as table) potato cultivars for the farmers for boosting the enterprise. For noncontract potato farming, a 'price stabilization fund' could be created to minimize the price fluctuation. Low-cost farm implements, low-cost and effective late blight controlling fungicides, supplying good quality seed at reasonable rates by the Agriculture Department were some of the other suggestions emerging from this study.

TI  - Dynamics and resource use efficiency of agricultural land sales and rental market in India
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - In a populous developing country such as India, developmental interventions are often woven around land, as this is the most critical resource in the livelihood support system of rural communities. In such a socio-economic environment, land has multiple uses. It is the most important source of income, a symbol of social status and prestige, and has very high collateral value for resource poor farm families. In these countries, the migration of rural workers to urban centers in search of employment, coupled with universal individual inheritance characteristics of land ownership, perpetuates the fragmentation of land holdings. In the majority of such cases, the point has been reached where land has become uneconomic and non-viable for cultivation. For farmers left with uneconomic land holdings there are only three options available; sell the land, rent it out, or lease land from others. In such scenarios land lease and land market policies assumes critical importance.
   India has one of the most restrictive and unorganized land sales and rental markets in the world. Such restrictive land sales policy can be traced to the historical socio-economic realities of the country. Historically, distress land sales have been very common. Under the restrictive poor land marketing environment of India, transaction costs for buying land are very high. Government imposed land sales taxes such as stamp duties which have to be paid upon registration of a transaction, further increase the total cost of land sales. Analysis of state level data on rental restrictions in India along with a nationally representative survey, indicate that rental restrictions negatively affect productivity and equity. Land rental restrictions reduce the scope for efficiency-enhancing rental transactions that benefit poor producers.
   This study attempts to identify drivers of the land market in India and compares level of resource productivity under different land lease arrangements. Such a study may offer valuable input to land policy planners in the formulation of land sales and land lease policies for agricultural land.
   The results of the study have important policy implications as the study suggests that there is little justification for restricting the functioning of land markets. The dominance of marginal and small farmers in land sales highlights the economic non-viability of marginal holdings. The prevalence of tenancy among various types of farmers suggests the need to grant legally recognized status to tenancy. This may protect the interest of both the lessor and lessee. Corporate farming/contract farming will need to be justified based on both economic and social considerations such as the cost of contract enforcement to marginal and small farmers after they enter into contract with the corporate sector.
   Results also indicate that while various short-term land lease arrangements have different production efficiency levels, differences in productivities across the land lease arrangements are relatively small. As such, it is difficult to view lower input use as a consequence of land lease arrangements. However findings do suggest that various short-term land lease contracts are relatively less productive than owner cultivated land. Decomposition of the factor intensity levels in the study identified chemical and seed inputs as the major source of differences. In conclusion, short-term land lease patterns do not constrain productivity at the current level of development in the Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh and there is little justification for restricting the functioning of land markets.

TI  - Voices unheard: Barriers to and opportunities for small farmers' participation in oil palm contract farming
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Increasing small farmers' participation in contract farming is a key policy directive in many developing countries as a means of achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, only a limited number of small farmers actually participate in contract farming globally. Using the information-rich case of contract farming in oil palm cultivation in Ghana, this paper examines why small farmers choose to participate or not in contract farming. Data was collected through in-depth personal interviews and focus group sessions. We find that small farmers: (i) abstain from contract farming primarily due to unfavourable contract requirements; (ii) quit contract farming primarily because they view contract farming as an exploitative practice that lacks equity; and (iii) participate in contract farming primarily to obtain critical farm inputs and to access mainstream markets. By offering novel insights into the underlying reasons why small farmers abstain, quit, and participate in contract farming, this study will aid policymakers and contract farming corporations in formulating targeted strategies to attract and retain small farmers in contract farming. This paper broadens conceptualizations of sustainable palm oil production by integrating the voice of an overlooked, but important group of actors, small farmers. We contend that without a signficant increase in small farmers' participation in contract farming, sustainable palm oil production will remain a distant, elusive goal. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Markets and Collective Action: A Case Study of Traditional Wheat Varieties in Turkey
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMY CULTURE AND SOCIETY
AB  - Turkey one of the centers of origin and genetic diversity for wheat. There are concerns about a global decline in crop genetic diversity in centers of agricultural diversity, the replacement of traditional varieties with modern varieties and implications for food security and climate change resilience. Market-oriented solutions can help conserve traditional wheat varieties, secure livelihoods and promote food security. However, overcoming marketing challenges of traditional varieties require collective action of small farmers. Based on fieldwork in Turkey, this article examines the conservation and development outcomes for two traditional wheat varieties, einkorn (Triticum monococcum) and a local bread wheat variety zeron/zerun (Triticum aestivum). While external development interventions are critical to secure guaranteed markets for farmers, bonding, bridging and linking social capital between farmers and external actors sustain collective action in the long term. Previous collective action of farmers and non-market solutions for agricultural biodiversity conservation, particularly seed exchange networks, also are critical for the effectiveness of market-oriented solutions. The national context, legal changes as well as socio-economic policies, also affects the decisions of farmers to cultivate the traditional varieties, and thus, should be included in the sustainability of market-oriented solutions for traditional wheat variety conservation.

TI  - Determinants of small farmers' participation in contract farming in developing countries: A study in Vietnam
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - This study aims to explore the determinants of farmers' participation in contract farming by using a qualitative approach and empirically assess the impact of the factors withdrawn from the qualitative analysis and previous studies by employing the probit model in Vietnam. The qualitative analysis illustrates 10 original factors that affect farmers' participation in contract farming, including cooperative membership, quality certifications, sale preferences, farming difficulties, technology, supporting policy and program, estimation of oversupply, market information flow, association membership, and experience of contract farming failure. The quantitative analysis provides empirical evidence that female heads, firm consulting activities, firm scales, cooperative membership, quality certifications, and good-road locations can significantly and positively influence farmers' participation in contract farming. Cooperative membership and quality certifications are the most important factors. Contrary to the expectation, head education and good soil negatively impact farmers' participation in contract farming. Besides, bad soil can hinder farmers from participating in contract farming.

TI  - Farmer Strategies for Dealing with Climatic Variability: A Case Study from the Mixteca Alta Region of Oaxaca, Mexico
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - This study describes an interdisciplinary methodology for helping small farmers prepare for climatic variability. We facilitated workshops in the Mixteca Alta region of Oaxaca, Mexico, in which groups of small farmers described how they had adapted to and prepared for past climate challenges. Farmers reported that their cropping systems were changing for multiple reasons: more drought, later rainfall onset, decreased rural labor, and introduced labor-saving technologies. Examination of climate data found that farmers' climate narratives were largely consistent with the observational record. There have been increases in temperature and rainfall intensity, and an increase in rainfall seasonality that may be perceived as later rainfall onset. Farmers also identified 14 indicators that they subsequently used to evaluate the condition of their agroecosystems. Farmers ranked landscape-scale indicators as more marginal than farmer management or soil quality indicators. From this analysis, farmers proposed strategies to improve the ability of their agroecosystems to cope with climatic variability. Notably, they recognized that social organizing and education are required for landscape-scale indicators to be improved. This outcome suggests that climate change adaptation by small farmers involves much more than just a set of farming practices, but also community action to tackle collective problems.

TI  - Success in High Value Horticultural Export Markets for the Small Farmers: The Case of Mahagrapes in India
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - In spite of being the second largest horticultural producer ill the world. India is a failed exporter mainly because of the inability to meet the food safety standards. Hence. successes in horticultural exports are rare. Here, we study one unique success story, Mahagrapes, a marketing partner to farmer cooperatives attributing its success to a combination of collective action and public private partnerships. Our results indicate that Mahagrapes farmers earn significantly higher income vis-a-vis their outside marketing option and smallholders face no bias ill selection. Together with the farmer's ability to consistently meet standards, this implies that the model can be scaled up. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

TI  - Farmers' preferences and willingness to pay for microcredit in Benin: results from in-the-field choice experiments in Benin
T2  - AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW
AB  - Purpose This document analyses farmers' preferences and willingness to pay (CAP) for microcredit, in order to facilitate their access in rural areas. Design/methodology/approach Data are based on a discrete choice experiment with 400 randomly selected farmers from 20 villages of the 7 Benin agricultural development hubs (ADHs). The preference choice modelling was performed using mixed logit (MXL) and latent class logit (LCL) models. Farmers' willingness to pay for each preferred attribute was estimated. The endogenous attribute attendance (EAA) model was also used to capture attribute non-attendance (ANA) phenomenon. Findings The results indicate that, on average, farmers prefer individual loans, low interest rates, in kind + cash loans, cash loans, disbursement before planting and loans with at least 10-month duration. These preferences vary according to farmers' classes. Farmers are willing to pay higher or lower interest rates depending on attribute importance. The estimate of the EAA model indicates that, when taking the ANA phenomenon into consideration, people will show stronger attitudes regarding WTP for important factors. Research limitations/implications Based on these results from Benin, microfinance institutions (MFIs) in developing countries can, based on the interest rates currently charged, attract more farmers as customers, reviewing the combination of the levels of the attributes associated with the nature of the loan, the type of loan (individual or collective), the disbursement period of funds, the waiting period of the loan and the loan duration. However, the study only considered production credit, ignoring equipment or investment credit. Practical implications The document provides information on the key factors that can facilitate producers' access to MFI products and services. Social implications Facilitating small farmers' access to financial service will contribute to poverty reduction. Originality/value This research contributes to the knowledge of the attributes and attribute levels favoured by farmers when choosing financial products and the amounts they agree to pay for these attributes. The implementation of the results would facilitate small producers' access to financial services; thus contributing to poverty reduction.

TI  - How Do Cooperatives Alleviate Poverty of Farmers? Evidence from Rural China
T2  - LAND
AB  - Farmers' cooperatives play an important role in enabling small farmers to integrate into modern agriculture. Based on the survey data of 7200 farmers in four provinces of China, this paper uses the multi-dimensional poverty measurement method and the instrumental variable method to reveal the transmission mechanism and multi-dimensional poverty reduction effect of farmers' cooperatives in deep poverty-stricken areas in China to realize joint agricultural empowerment through the supply chain. The results show that farmers' cooperatives play an important role in enhancing small farmers' financing, technology application, market sales, and rights decision-making. Every increase in the degree of interest connection between the two will help farmers reduce the multi-dimensional poverty level by 12.3%, and the mitigation effects on material poverty, ability poverty, and rights poverty are between 10% and 13%. Compared with agricultural cooperatives with weak organizational service capacity, cooperatives with high organizational service capacity have a more significant multi-dimensional poverty reduction effect on farmers, which leads to farmers obtaining financing and improving their ability and income. In addition, the difference in benefit coupling between agricultural cooperatives and farmers of different leading bodies also results in the heterogeneity of multi-dimensional poverty alleviation effects of farmers. To a certain extent, the supply chain is affected by the risk endowment of members, the supply chain's poverty alleviation performance is affected by members' supply chain's poverty alleviation performance, and there is a certain risk transfer and "distribution failure". Therefore, optimizing the benefit coupling structure and risk sharing mechanism between farmers' cooperatives and farmers has become an important way to break the pattern of "the strong are always strong" and "distribution failure" for supply chain members and farmers.

TI  - Responsibilising the Fairtrade Premium: Imagining better decision-making
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Fairtrade International (FTI) sets forth in its theory of change a food future that consists of fair trade, small farmer and farm worker empowerment and sustainable livelihoods for producers in the Global South. The enactment of this socio-technical imaginary, what we call the Fairtrade imaginary, relies upon a suite of voluntary standards as the means to organise actors and implement rules of engagement. A central component of the FTI imaginary is a social premium (the Fairtrade Premium) that consists of an extra amount of money paid by supply chain buyers to certified producer organisations (POs). On the one hand, this premium payment serves as a powerful demonstration of a responsible North-South trading system that benefits the producers. On the other hand, the premium payment is an object of conflict, as northern buyers criticize FTI and producers about a lack of transparency in the use of the Premium. We examine these tensions in the Fairtrade Imaginary in order to understand the role of decision-making in responsibilising trade practices. Empirical case studies of two banana POs, one in Ecuador and the other in Peru, show that separated decision-making processes increase levels of participation and accountability in Premium use. While organizational independence is an ideal type of responsibility in the Fairtrade imaginary, our findings suggest that the allocation of 'role-responsibility' across the system might better strengthen collective responsibility. We conclude that realising better food futures requires strengthening responsibilities for decision-making within POs, rather than pushing for more transparent accounting mechanisms between the POs and Fairtrade International.

TI  - Reaching Farmers through High Quality Seed Multiplication and Dissemination in Nueva Ecija, Iloilo, and Bohol
T2  - PHILIPPINE JOURNAL OF CROP SCIENCE
AB  - Increasing rice production and income of small farmers is always a challenge in Philippine agriculture. New approaches have to be explored so that farmers themselves can work together to achieve their goal of increased productivity and income. High quality seeds is one of the most important needs of farmers especially those who could not afford to buy. To address this problem, the Korea Program on International Agriculture (KOPIA) in collaboration with the Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice), LGUs and DA Regional Offices, implemented the seed multiplication and dissemination project to guarantee farmer's access to high quality seeds. The strategy involves lending farmers high quality seeds of the variety they chose at the start of planting season and after harvest they will return the equivalent cash of PhP1,000.0 per sack to the cooperative where they belong. The amount generated becomes the seed money of the cooperative which members can borrow to help finance their farm operations. Four years after the implementation of the collaborative study, the Bantug Primary Multi-Purpose Cooperative, in the Science City of Munoz, Nueva Ecija generated PhP1,279,050.00 and farm machines. Meanwhile, Bohol Farmers Multi-Purpose Cooperative in Pilar, Bohol generated PhP1,257,271.08 and a milling machine whereas the Sinibaan Farmers' Association in Dingle, Iloilo generated PhP 479,000.00 and irrigation facilities that service nearly 100 ha of rice field. Capacity enhancement through farmers' trainings on each site and free educational tour to South Korea were conducted to increase their knowledge on new technologies. Overall, this collaborative study is geared towards helping the government in achieving rice security and in helping farmers and their cooperative to increase income and capacity to expand rice farming operations.

TI  - Production, consumption and marketing of milk in Eastern Region of India: A farm level analysis
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
AB  - The present study was undertaken in the eastern region of India comprising the states of Bihar, West Bengal and Jharkhand with the objective to determine milk production, consumption and marketed surplus at farm level. The study found that, inspite of poor dairy development in the region, milk production and productivity was considerably high among the sample households. An average dairy household was producing about 36 litre of milk per day having average productivity of 10 litre per day per animal which was significantly higher than national averages. The milk was drawn more from crossbred cows on Small households and from local cow and buffalo on large households. The milk productivity was highest on large farms which serve as a motivation for removing the resource limitation on small and medium herd size categories farms and promote better feeding and management practices too. The consumption of liquid milk among producer households was 207 gm per day per capita which was higher than per capita availability in the region. Of the 10 per cent of the milk production retained at household level, 40 per cent was consumed as liquid milk and 60 per cent was converted into milk products. The latter share was higher among small herd size category catering to the rural non-milk producing households. The halwais/ dudhiyas/private dairies were the major marketing channels accounting for 61 per cent of the total marketed surplus and only 21 per cent of the milk was sold through cooperatives. The share of milk sold through latter channel by small farmers was still lower (10%) inspite of the fact that the marketed surplus per household was substantially higher (24.02 L/day). An analysis of the factors affecting marketed surplus found that being members of dairy cooperatives had the highest influence on marketed surplus of small farms.

TI  - INTEGRATING FARMERS' RIGHT TO TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURAL KNOWLEDGE INTO MALAYSIA PLANT VARIETY LAW
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - Lauded as stewards of agricultural biodiversity, successive generations of farmers have engaged in collective systems of conservation and innovation in improving crops since the earliest plant domestications. Their ancestral knowledge and practices have witnessed the sharing of the reproductive material between them since thereon. Modern agricultural expansion and development have contributed to the flow of crops globally. Intellectual property rights in the agricultural field such as patents and plant breeders' right, to a certain extent have affected these traditional agricultural practises of the farmers. Nonetheless in many parts of the world, where small farming communities still form an integral part of their food production chain, farmers' traditional farming practices and knowledge are still widely used. This paper argues that over reliance on modern system of agricultural and intellectual property rights in the long run might threaten these small farmers' communities and suggest that the Farmers' Rights concept as enshrined in the FAO Treaty 2004 should be integrated into national legislations affecting farmers. Applying doctrinal analysis on existing plant variety law in Malaysia, this article investigates the extent to which the concept of Farmers' Rights to their traditional agricultural practices has been incorporated into the law. By way of comparison with the practices in India, a country quoted as having best practices in implementing Farmers' Right, the paper attempt to suggest on the possible way to integrate their practices into the Malaysia plant variety law.

TI  - Determinants of side selling behaviour in emerging sorghum supply chains in Kisumu County, Kenya
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - Vertical coordination in agriculture has received popularity in recent years. They have emerged to transform farm enterprises from subsistence farming to commercially oriented production. Despite the importance attached to them, some farm enterprise owners are involved in side selling even though they are committed to specific vertical coordination strategic options. Factors influencing this behaviour are still unclear in the empirical literature. This study intends to bridge this gap by determining the extent of side selling in sorghum supply chains in Kisumu County. A stratified sampling technique was used to collect data from 266 sorghum farm enterprises. Primary data was obtained through interviews using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire administered by trained enumerators. The study used Fractional Response Model to determine the extent of side selling among sorghum farm enterprises. Results from Fractional Response Model reveal that farming experience, better prices from alternative markets, neighbourhood effect, frequency of contacts, low bargaining power and network externalities influence side selling positively. Whereas other forms of income, land size, credit access and trust reduces the probability of side selling. These results indicate that policymakers should generate policies that will strengthen the legal institutions in agriculture regarding breaching of agreements reducing the side selling behaviours of sorghum producers.

TI  - Contract farming, animal epidemic disease outbreaks, and inclusive growth in rural China
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - Contract farming (CF) is promoted as part of agricultural development policies in many countries. Few literature on CF has considered the animal epidemic risk, which significantly affects the total revenue and the re-distribution between the contract farmers and the enterprise. Using the ten-year nationwide household-level panel data, we investigate the Chinese poultry sector to analyse the inclusiveness of CF. We evaluate the impact of participating in CF on farmers' income and asset endowments when animal epidemic diseases occur. The results confirm the insurance and discover the special re-distribution function of CF through adjusting product price. CF negatively affects large farmers' poultry farming income while it could be mitigated during the animal epidemic disease outbreak. Meanwhile, participating in CF has a significant positive effect on small farmers' assets when diseases occur. However, CF fails to be 'inclusive' in the presence of risks. The above positive effect is limited due to overall fewer participation opportunities available to small farmers. Policy implications and suggestions are derived to improve the inclusiveness of CF to small household farmers.

TI  - Sustaining escapes from poverty
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The objectives of this research are to identify the difference between sustained and temporary poverty escapes for policy and program design, based on research in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Nepal, Niger, the Philippines, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. The method adopted is the q squared method used in studies on the dynamics of poverty, embedded in a conceptual extension of the capability approach through a risk chain analysis. The results show that key livelihood factors conducive to sustained escapes include diversification of economic activities typically spanning agricultural and off-farm sectors, and sometimes involving rural-urban migration. Important tangible assets include general asset holdings of consumer durables, farm or business equipment, livestock, and electricity. Intangible assets include the completion of at least lower secondary education of the household head, good health, and different forms of social relationships and networks. However, while livelihood strategies help improve income and build assets necessary for resilience, various risks permeate. In these risky contexts, the study finds that the enabling environment is critical in determining whether households can ultimately sustain escapes from poverty. Interactive features of this environment that are conducive to sustained escapes include context-specific pro-poor policy and infrastructure, for example around livestock insurance, climate-smart agriculture alongside predictable disaster risk management, universal health coverage, and supporting a negotiated approach to norm change. Together, these features place an emphasis on collective risk management, beyond a focus only or even primarily on inclusive growth policies. The paper argues that it is essential to understand the circumstances in which people live, from the local (micro) up to the societal (macro) contexts that can influence their ability to sustain a poverty escape, and respond in ways that together address the multifaceted sources of risk and vulnerability, which in turn allows for the less interrupted development of people's capabilities.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Impact of Contract Farming on Income: Linking Small Farmers, Packers, and Supermarkets in China
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study compares contract and non-contract growers of apples and green onions in Shandong Province, China in order to explore the constraints on participation and the impact of contract farming on income. We find little evidence that firms prefer to work with larger farms, though all farms in the area are quite small. Using a Heckman selection-correction model, we find that contract farming raises income even after controlling for observable and unobservable household characteristics. These results suggest that contract farming can help ruse small-farm income, though questions remain regarding the number of farmers that can be brought into such schemes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Induced Agricultural Production Organizations under the Transition of Rural Land Market: Evidence from China
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - This paper focuses on the impact of a new rural land reform, the Separation of Three Rights Reform, on changes in China's agricultural production organizations. We illustrate the impact of market and nonmarket mechanisms on allocating agricultural production factors under the new rural land market transition through a land system and factor allocation model. Based on the expansion paths of different types of factors in the model, we classify the development of Chinese agricultural production entities into "extensional expansion," "labor-intensive expansion," "land-intensive expansion," and "exit of agricultural production." These agricultural production paths correspond to agricultural enterprises, family farms, agricultural cooperatives, and small farmers' exit. Further, empirical and economic geography analysis results show that the interaction of market and nonmarket mechanisms is the main drive that induces the current diversified organizations in rural China. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive explanation of changing patterns of an agricultural production organization under the transition of the rural land market.

TI  - NUTRITION- BASED INCENTIVES IN DAIRY CONTRACT FARMING IN NORTHERN SENEGAL
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - In developing countries contract farming faces numerous challenges that many times lead to its failure. Innovations that help overcome the difficulties of contracting with a large pool of small farmers in such settings can enhance the viability of such schemes. We use a randomized control trial design combined with high frequency data to investigate the impact of adding a nutrition- based incentive in contracts between a Senegalese dairy processing factory and its semi- nomadic milk suppliers. The incentive rewarded suppliers for consistent milk deliveries with daily delivery of a micro- nutrient fortified yogurt for each young child in corresponding households. Findings show large and significant impacts on the frequency and amount of milk delivered, albeit limited to the dry season. We also find larger impacts on milk deliveries when contracts are managed by women.

TI  - Empowering women farmers through collective action: a case study of Khanizpur Hamlet, Odisha
T2  - GENDER TECHNOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Vulnerable landless women farmers face the dual challenge of small farm size and illegality of land tenancy. These smallholders face a lack of bargaining power in input and output markets and economic non-viability of technology adoption. We piloted a collective action model of organizing agriculture production work called "Small Farmers Large Field" with 35 landless tenant women farmers in Khanizpur village, Odisha. Within an embedded mixed method design, the study included the collection of both qualitative and quantitative data. In this QUAL + quan design, the qualitative dataset assumes the primary role. The results indicate that the per acre net income that represented a loss of INR 2,831 in the previous wet season changed to a positive profit of INR 15,065. Much of the increase in net income was due to the 60% increase in yield. Several factors including the use of good-quality seeds and adoption of improved practices contributed to such yield improvement. Apart from the monetary benefits, the collective action among farmers resulted in many non-monetary benefits such as improved knowledge on technology and production practices, stronger social network and civic engagement, and efficient use of water. In addition, farmers had a significant amount of time saving in different field operations.

TI  - The role of transformational leadership and leaders' skills for new agricultural cooperatives in post-soviet countries
T2  - ANNALS OF PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - Team leadership plays a crucial role in the management of agricultural cooperatives, especially in post-Soviet countries where farmers keep bad experiences from the collectivization of their farms. The main objective of the research was to investigate how important the role of leadership is in the process of establishing, initial sustaining of cooperation and members' commitment among small farmers in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Leadership was analysed from multiple perspectives using an explanatory sequential mixed approach involving quantitative and qualitative methods. We interviewed 293 cooperative leaders and members. The partial least squares structural equation model was used to examine the relationship between multiple constructs and variables. We concluded that leaders do differ in some of their characteristics from other members. They are the most active in the group, influencing all major decisions, playing a crucial role in trust-building and group cohesion. Their skills and leadership style are significantly important for members' commitment to the group's success. However, the dominance of group founders and lack of understanding of cooperative principles among members indicate some emerging challenges to the cooperatives' sustainability and efficiency, and it is necessary to focus on the progressive professionalization and capacity building of leaders while maintaining a transformational leadership style.

TI  - The Political Economy of Contract Farming in China's Agrarian Transition
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE
AB  - How does rural China's political economy determine the motivations and constraints that drive small farmers and agribusiness companies into contract farming and shape its practice and impact? This paper identifies three distinctive features of contract farming in China varied impact on rural inequality, unstable contractual relations and lack of competitiveness with other alternatives and proposes tentative explanations linked to three features in rural China's political economy: strong collective institutions, active state support for agriculture and strong domestic markets. The recent turn in China's agrarian transition towards vertical integration of agriculture with industries is, however, undermining these conditions and may move China towards more convergence with other countries. Studying contract farming in China's unique political economy context shows not only how variations in the political economy can alter its practice and impact, but also how it needs to be evaluated in comparison with competing alternatives.

TI  - Concluding synthesis and the future for sustainable goat production
T2  - SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH
CP  - 9th International Conference on Goats
AB  - The paper presents an analysis and conclusions of the 9th International Conference on Goats in Mexico. It highlights a very successful conference, the types and extent of subject matter areas that were addressed and their trends. Continuing emphasis on research along disciplinary lines is apparent, in comparison to the more applied links with development issues. It is suggested that future international conferences on goats should give more attention to development aspects concerned with increasing productivity. Emerging issues in the future and looming concerns were identified which emphasise the need for collective efforts to promote the potential future contribution of goats. Policy elements are also important and include: (i) policy through advocacy (i.e., education and empowerment); (ii) gender; investment in research and development (R & D); (iii) direct government action; and (iv) through law (i.e., microcredits and NGO participation). The overriding challenge is to define policies that can improve the livelihoods of small farmers and the landless who own goats, foster greater institutional involvement and investments in target agro-ecosystems, promote increased adaptive research and development involving productivity, enhancing technology application, and vigorous scale up production and post-production systems, linkages and market access. The resolution of these constitutes the challenges for the immediate future. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Smallholders' Preferences for Different Contract Farming Models: Empirical Evidence from Sustainable Certified Coffee Production in Vietnam
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Contract farming is considered as institutional arrangements that manage the coordination of production and distribution between smallholder farmers and agro-industrial firms. Under the market reforms and industrialization process, contract farming links smallholder farmers to a better market through effective farming management and high-quality products. Despite the many benefits attributed to participation, the existing literature addresses the main issues that result in the opposing attitudes and motivations toward contract farming. This study therefore aims to analyze factors that influence the choices of smallholder farmers for different contract faming models using multinomial logistic (MNL) regression. Different contract attributes and socio-economic characteristics of farmer households are used as endogenous variables in the MNL model. Based on a research sample of 183 smallholder farmers involved in certified coffee production in Dak Lak province, Vietnam, the study revealed that there are different typologies of production contract including the informal model, intermediary model, and nucleus estate model. Significant factors that affect smallholders' preferences for different contract farming models are gender, farm size, the provision of inputs, price option, technical assistance, delivery schedule, and monitoring. Main issues that induce failures of contract farming are farmer's overdependence and the monopolistic power of industrial coffee firms in the nucleus estate model, as well as the information asymmetry in the informal model. In addition, a cost-benefit analysis symbolizes the role of the cooperative in the intermediary model, which is essential for augmenting win-win outcomes for smallholder farmers and industrial coffee firms.

TI  - Transitioning to groundwater irrigated intensified agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa: An indicator based assessment
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB  - Growing populations, changing market conditions, and the food security risks posed by rainfed cropping and climate change collectively indicate that Sub-Saharan African nations could benefit from transforming agricultural production to more intensive yet resilient and sustainable systems. Although highly underutilized, emerging evidence indicates that groundwater may be more widely available than previously thought, highlighting its potential role in facilitating such a transformation. Nevertheless, the possibility for such a transition is conditioned by number of complex factors. We therefore construct a transition index that integrates data considering groundwater and energy availability and cost, market access, infrastructural needs, farm conditions and natural resource stocks, labor availability, climate, population density, as well as economic and political framework variables, using a principal component analysis based methodology. Using the consequent multi-dimensional transition index and constituent intermediate indices, we provide an assessment of groundwater irrigation potential discussed in consideration of Burkina Faso, Ghana, Malawi, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Zambia, Namibia, Cameroon, and Zimbabwe. Our results, though preliminary, provide a methodology for conducting such an integrated assessment, while deriving a holistic set of policy options considering the transition towards appropriate use of groundwater for agricultural development.

TI  - How farmer characteristics and dimensions of resilience correlate with farmers' ability to recover from shocks: a case study of Indonesian palm oil smallholders
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Most studies on the effects of certification on smallholders' livelihood emphasize vulnerability while neglecting resilience. This paper assesses the farmer resilience of five different types of palm oil smallholders in Indonesia. We use and apply Speranza's (2014) framework to assess and understand farmer resilience. We conclude that the correlations between buffer capacity, learning capacity, and resilience are rather weak. Our results further reveal that palm oil smallholders are relatively resilient to price declines, haze from forest fires and El Nino. The differences in resilience between the smallholder groups are small, although certified smallholders collaborating with companies and NGOs seem to be more resilient than uncertified smallholders collaborating with middlemen. The terminated Nucleus Estate Smallholder (NES) system allowed farmers to meet these favourable conditions. A few new initiatives, such as FAIR company-community partnerships may provide similar opportunities for smallholders. We also question the direct link between self-organization and resilience.

TI  - Linkages in modern distribution channels formation: the study of factors affecting mountainous agricultural products consumption in Vietnam
T2  - ECONOMIC ANNALS-XXI
AB  - Food distribution system in developing countries, for instance in Vietnam, has rapidly transformed towards modern supply channels with high quality products. We observe that producers of the agricultural products at mountainous areas face significant challenges in accessing to modern distribution channels. In such condition, linkages appear as a key factor for small scale farmers connecting to markets. In this regard, the purpose of our research is to study the factors affecting linkages in the formation of modern distribution channels in view of consumption of mountainous agricultural products in Vietnam and developing countries in general.
   In our research model, we tested 6 elaborated hypotheses focused on the issue of linkage in modern distribution channel formation and introduced 26 observed variables. We conducted the survey at 8 out of 11 districts of the mountainous areas of Thanh Hoa province of Vietnam in 2018 with 215 small farmers being the respondents.
   The results indicates that linkages in modern distribution channels formation for mountainous agricultural consumption has strongly affected by a range of significant groups of factors, namely: natural conditions of the mountainous area; characteristics of agricultural products in the mountainous area; support of firms; government policies aimed at the formation of linkages; constraints in agricultural production; barriers to enter modern distribution channels.
   The results of the undertaken regression analysis imply the following. 1) The requirements of modern distribution channels (brand name, prices, professional collecting, etc.) are big barriers for farmers in mountainous areas who want to access the market, which explains the reason why small farmers are motivated to use linkages in order to enter the modern distribution system. In fact, most agricultural products at mountainous areas are in a raw form, without packaging, labelling, and traceability, while small-scale farmers do not have enough capacity to keep to such standards. 2) Typical local products of mountainous areas tend to be formed by the linkage. This comes from the fact that popular agricultural products that are common for traditional markets or products with low value have little impact on the formation of the linkage while high-value products tend to join the linkage to reach larger markets beyond mountainous areas. From this point of view, linkages in the formation of the modern distribution system are required for typical local products in mountainous areas. 3) The role of firms in building linkages is crucial. Firms play an important role in supplying products from mountainous areas to the market. Whether the linkage becomes a success or not, depends on the level of involvement of firms. 4) It is necessary to have a strong policy (both from the part of local authorities and the government) in order to encourage firms, households and other stakeholders to be involved in the creation of linkages in mountainous areas. Since the market power is largely considered within the agricultural market, the government policy becomes very important in terms of helping small farmers to become stronger players in the market and encouraging firms to participate in the formation of linkages.
   Obtained results correlate with several studies on linkages in developing countries, which are also linked to comparable cases of mountainous areas. We, therefore, propose recommendations for developing countries related to the issue of linkages in the formation of the modern distribution system. We emphasize that it is required to select products to build linkage models, to implement strong policies to attract enterprises to join linkages in mountainous areas, to build linkage models to add values to mountainous agricultural products connected to the requirements of modern distribution channels and, finally, to improve the production scale of mountainous farmers by conducting a land reform in order to create conditions for the formation of linkages and increase market power of middlemen in agricultural markets in the developing countries.

TI  - Understanding farmer cooperatives' self-inspection behavior to guarantee agri-product safety in China
T2  - FOOD CONTROL
AB  - Both global and domestic markets place increasing importance on the quality and safety of food products that are produced in China. The presence of microbial agents, toxic animal and plant products and chemical contamination remain because of the existence of small and dispersed farmers, who are not educated to use agricultural inputs correctly. This inability raises the issue of safety control in the agricultural sector. This study proposes that cooperatives' self-inspection of agricultural products before they enter the market can better organize small farmers to utilize a standardized production and safety management system. Therefore, we attempt to explore the factors that influence farmer cooperatives' self-inspection behavior. An Ordered Logistic Regression Model is employed to estimate the factors that influence cooperatives' choices of inspection frequency. The results show that the respondents expressed a medium to high level of implementing self-inspection but a lower level of concern in testing products by batch. The regression results indicate that subjective norms from the social environment, the perceived behavioral control of managers, ability and rules including input management, production documentation, and social demographic variables, significantly affect cooperatives' self-inspection behavior. The future implementation of safety inspection depends on the extent to which subjective norms, ability, and internal rules can improve agri-product safety in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Influence of livelihoods on climate change adaptation for smallholder farmers in the Mekong Delta Vietnam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Farmers in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta face a wide range of climate-related and hydrological factors which threaten rice production. Smallholder farmers must adapt to climate change to sustain rice production as their central and most important livelihood activity. A sample was stratified across agro-ecological areas in the Delta affected by flooding, alluvial soils, acid sulphate soils, and saline water intrusion and by derived farmer typologies. A rural livelihoods approach was used in focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to identify and enumerate enabling and constraining adaptation factors. Smallholders experienced diverse natural hazards such as floods, abnormal rains, high temperatures, water scarcity, and salinity intrusion specific to the agro-ecological areas. Adaptation was constrained by labour shortages, water quality, topography, access to combine harvesters, transportation infrastructure, dryers and household savings. Adaptation was enabled by farming techniques and experience, cooperative groups, water quantity, access to information, and ability to purchase agro-chemicals through credit. Small farmers (< 1ha) were more constrained than large farmers (> 1ha) who had an expanded livelihood asset base. A range of policy implications are discussed, but adaptation is not just about technological fixes but requires overall improvements in a range of human, social and financial components.

TI  - Globalisation and poverty in Senegal: a worst case scenario?
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - There is no consensus about how globalisation - trade and foreign investments - affects poverty reduction. Using household survey data, this study contributes to the empirical literature on globalisation and poverty by analysing the household-level implications of increased foreign investments and trade in the horticulture sector in Senegal. In many aspects this represents what many would consider a 'worst-case scenario'. Stringent rich country standards are imposed on exports and the supply chain is controlled by a single multinational company with extreme levels of supply base consolidation and vertical integration and complete exclusion of smallholder suppliers. We analyse and quantify income and poverty effects under these 'worst-case conditions' and find significant positive welfare impacts through employment creation and labour market participation.

TI  - The benefits and limitations of agricultural input cooperatives in Zambia
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Policymakers in Southern Africa have long viewed agricultural cooperatives as a way to reach rural households more easily, but because not all rural households can afford to join cooperatives, this raises questions about membership inclusivity and whether cooperatives advantage some smallholders over others. Agricultural cooperatives can serve as an institutional vehicle for policymakers to deliver direct benefits to smallholder farmers in the form of subsidized agricultural inputs, usually improved seed varieties and fertilizers. They can also serve as platforms for collective action through which smallholders can reduce transportation and transaction costs or disperse the costs of marketing. In Zambia farmers are required to join a cooperative to qualify for seed and fertilizer support through the national Farmer Input Support Program (FISP), which is a structural incentive for cooperative membership and makes it complicated to determine if cooperative membership increases use of inputs and yields on its own. Using the Inverse Probability Weight Regression Adjustment (IPWRA) technique, we find Zambian smallholders participating in cooperatives achieve significantly higher maize yields and use significantly more hybrid-maize seed and fertilizers, even when controlling for FISP eligibility. Furthermore, across all selected productivity and input variables we find greater average treatment effects from cooperative membership than FISP participation. Cooperative membership is also associated with more assets, more land, and higher maize yields, which suggests that the poorest rural households are often not cooperative members. Cooperatives can be a powerful poverty policy tool to deliver direct benefits to small farmers, but not including the poorest households likely widens the rural poverty gap, both in terms of limited direct benefits of input support programs and in terms of farmers missing out on cooperative-specific benefits.

TI  - Migrant workers into contract farmers: processes of labour mobilization in colonial and contemporary Mozambique
T2  - AFRICA
AB  - As contract farming gains ground as a form of agricultural production in Southern Africa, there is growing interest in its effects on patterns of investment and production as well as in its potential to provide small farmers with access to export markets. However, the relation between contract farming and the region's long history of labour migration has largely escaped analysts and scholars working on Southern Africa. This article traces the changing livelihoods of those who experienced the demise of the migrant labour system and displacement during the civil war, and who now engage in contract farming in Angonia, a densely populated district in Tete Province, central Mozambique. In the decades since the end of the war, contract farming thrived among former migrants with access to land and few alternative sources of income and employment. If historical labour migration from Angonia involved attempts by employers to externalize the responsibility for social reproduction onto households, contract farming amounts to the internalization by households of the opportunities, risks and tensions involved in the production of high-value export commodities. By analysing farmers' accounts of producing under contract and linking this to their households' longer histories of labour mobilization, this article sheds light on people's experiences of working for wages, working on their own account and hiring workers, as households became the new sites of commodity production.

TI  - Certified standards and vertical coordination in aquaculture: The case of pangasius from Vietnam
T2  - AQUACULTURE
AB  - This paper explores the interaction between food standards and vertical coordination in the Vietnamese pangasius sector. For farmers and processors alike, the adoption of standards is motivated by a desire to improve market access by ensuring high quality supply. Instead of encouraging the application of standards and contract farming, processing companies prefer to vertically integrate primary production largely due to concerns over the stable supply of pangasius with satisfactory quality and safety attributes. These tendencies increase the market dominance of industrial farming and worsen the position of small household farms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Forest commons, vertical integration and smallholder's saving and investment responses: Evidence from a quasi-experiment
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - As the result of prohibitively high transaction costs, smallholder farmers are only partly integrated into agricultural and forest commodity markets, a situation that may leave them in a lower level of development equilibrium (i.e., a poverty trap). For the most part, many users of forest commons extract forest products, typically non-timber products, for subsistence use or safety net purposes. To overcome this problem, in recent years, collective vertical integration (VI) of forest product marketing cooperative structures have been promoted and, in some cases, adopted by users of forest commons. Although this type of program has been observed to raise smallholder incomes, there is little evidence available on saving/investment responses to such income gains. This paper investigates precautionary saving and investment responses to collective forest product marketing programs among users of forest commons in Ethiopian villages. To identify the causal effects of the program, I applied propensity score matching, difference-in-difference (DID) and change-in-change (CIC) estimators to household survey data collected from randomly selected households in the Gimbo district (south-western Ethiopia). I find strong evidence that participation in the program reduces savings in the form of livestock holdings and that effect is limited to non-poor households. When interpreted in terms of the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH), the results imply that participants felt the current income gains to be non-transient, which led to reduced precautionary savings and to a gain in consumption/welfare. Moreover, I found that the program has spurred investment in child education and participation in off-farm self-employment. These results point to the importance of the safety net/insurance channel of the program. Overall, the findings underscore the program's potential to raise the standard of living via ancillary mechanisms beyond directly raising income outcome. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sustainability of fish pond culture in rural farming systems of Central and Western Cameroon
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In Sub-Saharan Africa, fish ponds are often an integral part of farming systems but have suffered from a lack of viability and sustainability. The present study aims to understand the strategies used by fish farmers to overcome economic and environmental constraints. In 2008 and 2009, fish farmers were surveyed in Central and Western Cameroon, and the fish production systems were classified by cluster analysis. Four broad types were identified according to the complexity of household operations. The development of extensive systems (large-scale and low-input) in rural areas of central Cameroon is induced mainly by abundant available land. For semi-intensive systems in both regions (small-scale and highinput in the Western Region, large-scale and high-input in peri-urban areas of the Central Region), horizontal integration is not sufficient to make fish production profitable and sustainable. More intensive fish farms tend towards vertical integration, in which farmers establish close links with input suppliers. Main causes of low productivity of semi-intensive systems (1-2 t/ha/yr) are both lack of knowledge of fish farming principles by farmers and lack of technical improvement by extension agents and researchers which need to consider the local complexity of farming systems to develop and intensify fish production. The adaptation of development strategies to socio-economic and environmental contexts is a necessity to hope for an increase in fish pond aquaculture production in Africa.

TI  - Evaluating the commercialization of smallholder malt barley farmers via vertical coordination in Arsi highlands, Oromia region, Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - Smallholder farmers search for their product buyers in local spot market transactions. In spot market transactions, farmers will not be assured of ready markets for their production, or face volatile market prices. Similarly malt barley farmers used to face challenges of accessing input, farm technology, credit, and information that undermine their livelihoods. Vertically coordinated malt barley supply chain is evolving fast in Ethiopia. The purpose of this study was to analyze nexus between vertical coordination and level of malt barley commercialization in the study area. This study has been conducted in four districts of Arsi highlands known for their malt barley production potentials and presence of active supply chain coordination. A three-stage sampling procedure was employed to collect data using interview schedule from 384 (190 contract and 194 non-contract) randomly selected malt barley farmers. Descriptive statistics and Tobit regression model used to analyze farmer and farm-related factors vis-a-vis vertical coordination and level and determinants of commercialization farm households. Accordingly, the study identified that 11.05% of the respondents had <30% level of commercialization, when 55% were in between 30% and 65% and the rest, 34.21% of sampled malt barley farm households had more than 65% level of malt barley commercialization. Tobit regression revealed that farm size, yield, price, quantity of fertilizer applied, contract agreements, mobile phone ownership and access to credit were determinants of level of malt barley commercialization. Thus, endeavors of malt barley commercialization have to focus on improving access to technology, credit, extension, and organizing farmers in contract farming among others.

TI  - Risk preference interactions between individual farmers and small farmer groups: Experimental evidence from rural Ethiopia
T2  - REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - The understanding of risk preference interactions among poor farmers in developing countries has important policy implications, as many programs that aim to alleviate poverty and address risk constraints are provided on a collective basis. We conduct a randomized field experiment in the drought-prone parts of Northern Ethiopia and elicit from poor, vulnerable farmers their hypothetical willingness to pay using individual and group lottery games. Analyzing the certainty equivalent ratios (CERs), we find that farmer groups are more risk averse than individual farmers. When the risk of the lottery is high, the group CER is primarily determined by the most-risk-averse farmer of the group, and to a lesser extent, by the least. The median farmer contributes to the group CER only when the lottery risk is moderate. After participating in the group elicitation, individual farmers also become as risk averse as the group on average. Specifically, the median and the least-risk-averse farmers become significantly more risk averse while the most-risk-averse farmer is unaffected. Our results show that policymakers should carefully consider how social interactions in rural communities affect individual and group risk preference and whether social interactions also affect the participation and effectiveness of development programs.

TI  - Supply Chain Analysis of Contract Farming
T2  - M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Contract farming is a growing practice in developing countries and first-world economies alike. It generates necessary guarantees to sustain the continued operations of vulnerable farmers while enabling the manufacturers to manage the aggregate supply and price risk. We consider a single manufacturer who owns several manufacturing plants, each with a random demand for the crop. The manufacturer selects a set of farmers to offer a menu of contracts, which is exogenously specified or endogenously determined. Each "selected" farmer chooses a contract from this menu in advance of the growing season. After the growing season, under known demands and supplies, the manufacturer minimizes the distribution costs from the selected farmers to the production facilities. We formulate this problem as a Stackelberg game with asymmetric information, where the manufacturer is the leader and the farmers are the followers. The manufacturer's problem is a two-stage stochastic planning program for which we develop two solution approaches. We have applied our model to problem instances anchored on data from a large manufacturer of potato chips contracting with thousands of small farmers in India. We report on the performance of the solution methods compared with a lower bound based on the Lagrangean dual of the problem and show that the optimality gap is below 1%, for problem instances with 1,000 potential farmers. We also show how our model can be used to gain various managerial insights. As an example, when constructing the contract menu endogenously, often a small number of contract options suffices, depending on the degree of heterogeneity among the farmer pool. Thus, relatively simple menus often suffice.

TI  - Are household production decisions cooperative? Evidence on pastoral migration and milk sales from northern Kenya
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Market-based development efforts frequently create opportunities to generate income from goods previously produced and consumed within the household. Production within the household is often characterized by a gender and age division of labor. Market development efforts to improve wellbeing may lead to unanticipated outcomes if household production decisions are noncooperative. We develop and test models of household decision making to investigate intrahousehold decision making in a nomadic pastoral setting from Kenya. Our results suggest that household decisions are contested, with husbands using migration decisions to resist wives' ability to market milk.

TI  - Supermarket procurement and farmgate prices in India
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Supermarkets have gained in importance in the food systems of many developing countries, with profound implications for smallholder farmers. Several studies analyzed effects of selling to supermarkets on smallholder productivity and income. However, no previous work systematically analyzed effects of supermarkets on farmgate prices, even though prices are important determinants of farmers' profits and livelihoods. Here, we use data from smallholder vegetable growers in India to compare output prices received in supermarket and traditional market channels. We also quantify farmers' transport and transaction costs in both channels. Even after controlling for quality differences, prices are significantly higher in supermarket channels. Positive price effects are confirmed through hedonic price models and propensity score matching. Average effects of supermarkets on farmgate prices are in a magnitude of 20% or more. Higher farmgate prices are due to fewer intermediaries and lower transaction costs in supermarket channels. In the absence of binding contracts, supermarkets also need to pay higher prices to ensure regular supply of high-quality vegetables. These results suggest that the rise of supermarkets can contribute to increased market efficiency with positive effects on farmgate prices and revenues. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Small forest growers in tropical landscapes should be embraced as partners for Green-growth: Increase wood supply, restore land, reduce poverty, and mitigate climate change
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
AB  - Our ideas and investments for landscape restoration should be broadened to include sustainably managed plantation forestry, especially those owned by small growers in forest-rural landscapes, as a part of the solution. Small growers play seminal roles in tropical forestry; for example, they provide about 90% and 60% of the industrial wood in India and Vietnam, respectively, and are central for countries such as Ethiopia and Uganda. They contribute to restoration of degraded landscapes in large areas. Wood production and use of wood products as a carbon positive, renewable, recyclable material should be a part of climate change mitigation actions. Forestry and wood-based business is providing livelihoods for millions of rural households and probably helping hundreds of thousands of families out of poverty.
   Tropical countries are facing widening wood supply-demand gaps. Substantial growth of wood production from small-scale plantations via both higher productivity per unit area and carefully managed land expansion, may be the only options for closing this gap. Nevertheless, there is no reliable inventory of the number of small-scale growers and households involved in any tropical country. Similarly, there is a serious lack of attention given to productivity in small-scale plantations, and exploring how sustainable management practices can improve productivity, product value, economic outcomes, and environmental benefits, at appropriate spatial and temporal scales.
   Many projects carried out in the name of small growers within country are fragmented, donor-driven, and uncoordinated. They will be more effective for providing benefits to small-growers if each recipient country developed a holistic and coherent strategy with priorities for advancing small-scale plantation forestry, within which, projects from international groups are harnessed. Creation of a cooperative (public-private), action and impact driven organisation(centre) is proposed. For success, the private sector should engage small growers as co-investing partners for advancing Green-growth and landscape restoration, and thus foster a direct conduit for channelling the global interests in tree-forest based solutions for improving the environment and reducing rural poverty.
   Small-scale plantation forestry can be substantially strengthened by three opportunities: the growing demand for wood, the role of forests and land restoration in the global carbon cycle and for low-emissions economy, and the urgent need to uplift rural economies and reduce poverty. These challenges are interwoven, and sustainably managed forestry offers integrated solutions for addressing them.

TI  - Problems of financing and agricultural credit: A case study of Seyhan region
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - In this research, credit using situation examined before 2000s in context of example of Scyhan Plain in Adana in Turkey. The purpose of this research is to study the needs and opportunities for agricultural credit in the Adana region (675,000 ha including 223,000 irrigated). In the region farms have a very intensive production, with large input requirements and investments. In addition, prices and product yields fluctuate with weather conditions, market conditions, as well as farmers' choices to certain specialized production, which causes a large fluctuation in farm income. This offset can cause additional problems. On the other hand, traditional or modern family expenses, increase with urbanization. This phenomenon, coupled with a general increase in agricultural production costs, are causing a severe shortage of working capital to the farmer, who then sees the increase on its credit requirements. Normally, agricultural credit is mainly provided by the State agencies (Agricultural Bank, Agricultural Cooperatives). Indeed, this system is cheaper for farmers because the interest rates charged are well below the inflation rate but it requires guarantees, formality restrict the volume of loans actually granted, especially for small farmers. Thus, the latter to torment a parallel range of credit (loan shark, Firms, non-agricultural banks, etc.) or the interest rate is generally very high and the formalities for obtaining less painful.

TI  - An international comparison of rice consumption behaviours and greenhouse gas emissions from rice production
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Rice is a staple food for over half the global population and is mostly produced by smallholders. Rice cultivation at global level is responsible for over 10% of global agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and about 1.3%-1.8% of the anthropogenic GHG emissions. Taking time, series data from the World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organisation, International Rice Research Institute and United States Department of Agriculture, this study aims to compare the trends and magnitudes of rice yield, per capita rice consumption and its relationships with per capita income and life expectancy, as well as CH4 and N2O emissions from rice farming among the eight different countries (China, India, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Indonesia) which, collectively, account for about 82.05% of the global rice production and 78.23% of the global rice consumption. Moreover, agricultural practices as a whole in these eight countries is responsible for 35% of global agricultural emissions. Over the 54 year period of study from 1961 to 2014, rice yield increased significantly in all countries; however, the current pace is not sufficient to meet the increasing demands. Similarly, results suggest that the generalisation of rice consumption behaviour as normal or inferior goods is misleading and is largely influenced by the culture, norms, values and beliefs of a given country. Although the absolute amounts of GHG emissions from rice cultivation has increased in all countries during the study period, the corresponding emission intensities have declined sharply, mainly due to the rapid increase in yield. Among the eight countries, China and Vietnam's performance was better in terms of their increased yield, decreasing rates of emissions intensity and a lower water footprint whilst Thailand's performance was poorest. The differences between the different countries and practices which enable more rice to be produced with less water, energy and land are also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Towards Universal Health Coverage via Social Health Insurance in China: Systemic Fragmentation, Reform Imperatives, and Policy Alternatives
T2  - APPLIED HEALTH ECONOMICS AND HEALTH POLICY
AB  - China's remarkable progress in building a comprehensive social health insurance (SHI) system was swift and impressive. Yet the country's decentralized and incremental approach towards universal coverage has created a fragmented SHI system under which a series of structural deficiencies have emerged with negative impacts. First, contingent on local conditions and financing capacity, benefit packages vary considerably across schemes, leading to systematic inequity. Second, the existence of multiple schemes, complicated by massive migration, has resulted in weak portability of SHI, creating further barriers to access. Third, many individuals are enrolled on multiple schemes, which causes inefficient use of government subsidies. Moral hazard and adverse selection are not effectively managed. The Chinese government announced its blueprint for integrating the urban and rural resident schemes in early 2016, paving the way for the ultimate consolidation of all SHI schemes and equal benefits for all. This article proposes three policy alternatives to inform the consolidation: (1) a single-pool system at the prefectural level with significant government subsidies, (2) a dual-pool system at the prefectural level with risk-equalization mechanisms, and (3) a household approach without merging existing pools. Vertical integration to the provincial level is unlikely to happen in the near future. Two caveats are raised to inform this transition towards universal health coverage.

TI  - Inclusive neoliberalism? Perspectives from Eastern Caribbean farmers
T2  - PROGRESS IN DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - Banana farming in the Eastern Caribbean has gone from riches to rags since the 1990s, as the region's economic and social mainstay has severely contracted. This article reports on interviews conducted at the grassroots level with about 150 current or former banana farmers in Dominica and St. Lucia, and at the administrative level with numerous government and banana sector officials and other stakeholders. The interviews sought to answer two interrelated questions: (a) How have farmers experienced and responded to this severe contraction in the banana export industry? and (b) To what extent does current development policy support farmers' economic needs? Indeed, many of the stated goals of the current development paradigm, referred to as 'inclusive neoliberalism', align with the farmers' stated needs. We seek to understand the extent to which this development policy manifests itself at the grassroots level in the form of support that small farmers can actually use to help sell their products. Our interviews document multiple ways that banana farmers have been hurt by changes in international trade policy. The interviews also reveal a considerable gap between the stated desires and development policy priorities of farmers, on the one hand, and the impacts of development policy at the grassroots level, on the other. We conclude with suggestions on how to bridge the gap between inclusive neoliberal development policy and the needs of small farmers, who for decades have been the social and economic bedrock of Eastern Caribbean societies.

TI  - Women's Autonomy in Decision Making for Health Care in South Asia
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - This article aims to discuss women's autonomy in decision making on health care, and its determinants in 3 South Asian countries, using nationally representative surveys. Women's participation either alone or jointly in household decisions on their own health care was considered as an indicator of women's autonomy in decision making. The results revealed that decisions of women's health care were made without their participation in the majority of Nepal (72.7%) and approximately half of Bangladesh (54.3%) and Indian (48.5%) households. In Sri Lanka, decision making for contraceptive use was a collective responsibility in the majority (79.7%). Women's participation in decision making significantly increased with age, education, and number of children. Women who were employed and earned cash had a stronger say in household decision making than women who did not work or worked not for cash. Rural and poor women were less likely to be involved in decision making than urban or rich women.

TI  - Impacts of farmer cooperative membership on household income and inequality: Evidence from a household survey in China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD ECONOMICS
AB  - While joining farmer cooperatives has been identified as a way for farmers, especially small farmers, to overcome their limitations in the marketplace and increase their income, this paper presents an analytical framework for examining how farmer cooperative may increase farmer income in rural China, empirically assesses the impacts of such membership on household income, and examines how the membership may affect income inequality. Data from a large-scale survey of rural households in China are used to examine the impacts of farmer cooperative membership and other factors on household income through a multivariate regression analysis and to test whether the impacts are different across income groups through a quantile regression analysis. The propensity score matching technique is used to address potential self-selection bias problems in the dataset and quantile regression is used to examine the impact for different income quantiles or groups of farmers. The empirical results indicate that farmers participating in professional cooperatives, on average, earned significantly higher income than their counterparts, but the positive impact was not statistically significant for low-income quantiles. This finding suggests that encouraging the development of and participation in farmer cooperatives could increase the average income but may not contribute directly to the policy goal of reducing income inequality in rural China.

TI  - Household food security and biofuel feedstock production in rural Mozambique and Tanzania
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - The ongoing debate over the impact of biofuels on food security makes it difficult for governments to develop clear policies for an industry that can enhance rural employment and help to alleviate rural poverty, but may also reduce food availability and raise food prices. Whilst there have been many studies reporting a wide range of global commodity price impacts arising from the sharp rise in biofuel use over the past decade, there has been less evidence on food security impacts at a local level in developing countries. Where evidence does exist the impact is difficult to assess, often due to different types of production models and feedstocks, but also due to weaknesses in the methodologies and measures of food security used. This paper aims to help address this evidence gap by analysing household survey data from sites close to different types of biofuel operations in Mozambique and Tanzania, using an index that measures key macronutrient and micronutrient deficits at the household level. The results show that those households with employees in medium to large-scale biofuel feedstock operations achieved significantly higher food security outcomes than other households in the same locations. Furthermore, most of the households with better food security outcomes reported an improvement in food security since the biofuel operations had been established and attributed this mainly to increased and more regular income from salaried employment.

TI  - Transaction Costs, Institutional Arrangements and Inequality Outcomes: Potato Marketing by Small Producers in Rural Peru
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We explore the distributional effects of lowering transaction costs to allow access to improved market opportunities for small farmers in the Peruvian Highlands. We find that when new marketing opportunities arise, those that have more land, are better educated and are well organized are able to deal with the complexities that the new contractual arrangements entail. Although this on average implies an increase in net income for small farmers, it also affects the distribution of earnings, generating a more polarized small farmer economy. To counteract this effect and reduce inequality in the opportunities of less endowed small farmers, complementary policies need to be put in place. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Group membership and certification effects on incomes of coffee farmers in Uganda
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Discrepancies in certification effects on smallholder incomes have been found in scientific literature. Unobserved farmer-group heterogeneity is a likely reason. For the long-standing Robusta coffee farmer-groups in Uganda, we find no significant effect of certification on net-farm income. But, we find 20 percentage point differences in net-farm income between certified and non-certified farmers explained by membership duration. In contrast, the recently founded certified Arabica coffee farmer-groups have positive net-farm income effects of 151 per cent, partly explained by a higher degree of vertical integration. With or without certification, long-standing group membership is found to have positive income effects.

TI  - Irrigation in farmers' land-use choices: Panel-data evidence from Viet Nam
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - Irrigation and land use are crucial issues in rural sustainable development. The current study modifies the sustainable framework of livelihoods to clarify the role of irrigation management in farmers' land-use choices. A five-wave panel dataset of 1,534 farms for the period 2008-2016 in Viet Nam (with a total of 7,669 observations) is used for analyzing the influence of irrigation management on land-use selections, employing a fixed-effects model. Irrigation management is investigated in six aspects: (i) the physical conditions, (ii) the ownership of facilities, (iii) the operations, (iv) the management responsibility shift, (v) the decision-making, and (vi) the maintenance. The results reveal that the overall effects of irrigation management are so different, depending on the types of land uses. On top of that, different aspects of irrigation management have diversified influences on types of land uses. The findings lead to several important implications related to irrigation management that are relevant to farmers and policymakers. Different stakeholders, organizations/institutions, and farming households play differently effective roles in irrigation management. In general, policies can be conducted through the development of a lined irrigation network, and decision-making in operations of irrigation, maintenance of irrigation, and irrigation maintenance should give more power to farmers' groups.

This paper quantifies income and poverty effects of high-standards trade and integrates labor market effects. by using company and household survey data front the vegetable export chain in Senegal. We find that exports grew sharply despite increasing standards, contributing importantly to rural incomes and poverty reduction. Tightening standards induced a shift from smallholder contract farming to integrated estate production, altering the mechanism through which poor households benefit: through labor markets instead of product markets.

TI  - Assets, Shocks, and Poverty Traps in Rural Mozambique
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This paper explores welfare dynamics among households in rural Mozambique. Using household panel data, we test whether an asset-based poverty trap exists. Findings indicate that all rural households converge to one stable equilibrium in the medium term, which is close to the poverty line. This may indicate that households in rural Mozambique are collectively trapped in generalized underdevelopment. A drought and household coping strategies help to explain the observed poverty dynamics. Food-insecure households who have better access to income-generating opportunities and who can afford drawing on unproductive assets are able to sustain their productive asset base in the short term.

TI  - Certified organic agriculture in China and Brazil: Market accessibility and outcomes following adoption
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Based on three case studies in China and Brazil, this paper explores the terms of access for farmers' participation in certified organic agriculture (OA) and investigates the influence of adoption on productivity, nutrient budgets, income and labour use. Small-scale farmers converting to OA require substantial external production-related, marketing and certification support. Access to OA was strongly dependent upon the type of support available to farmers. Organization based on a contract-farming model resulted in OA only being an option available to a narrow group of farmers, whilst OA initiated by a farmer cooperative provided better access. Gross output was significantly higher for oranges, whilst for the other crops gross output was similar. However, organic farmers in China felt that adoption had improved prices, incomes and market access. Farmers' perception of improved incomes is probably due to improved market access coupled with either a large production base, production intensification and production diversification. This study demonstrates that organization of farmers, and the manner in which this is structured, is crucial for external support to have an effect. Thus, OA may be a development path for small farmers if the supporting structures are provided at a small financial interest rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.

TI  - The potential of land shareholding cooperatives for inclusive agribusiness development in Africa
T2  - ANNALS OF PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - Land Shareholding Cooperatives (LSCs) centralize management over fragmented farmland by converting farmers' plots into shares. While these cooperatives have been widely successful in boosting agricultural commercialization among rural smallholders in China, their potential has not yet been recognized in the African context. To fill this gap, we present and discuss a theoretical framework based on recent literature, an in-depth case study from Uganda and quantitative analyses of data on horticultural cooperatives from Senegal and agricultural and livestock cooperatives from Uganda, Malawi, Madagascar, Rwanda and Kenya. We uncover the existence of cooperatives built on land sharing schemes in different parts of Africa and especially in Rwanda. We find that these LSCs are more likely to mobilize collective marketing and have a higher business-membership ratio than traditional cooperatives, and we derive a few implications for policymaking.

TI  - Fairtrade and Sustainability: Motivations for Fairtrade Certification among Smallholder Coffee Growers in Tanzania
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Drawing on a survey of 148 Fairtrade-certified smallholder coffee farmers in the Kagera region of Tanzania, a quantitative investigation was performed on the farmers' motivations for Fairtrade certification. A factor analysis approach was used to analyze the importance of economic, social, and environmental motivations in farmers' decision-making on Fairtrade-labeled coffee certification. Moreover, three ordered logit models were estimated to assess the determinants of motivational behavior for Fairtrade certification among different socioeconomic groups in the survey sample. Overall, the results indicate that Fairtrade certification is predominantly economically motivated. Particularly, farmers are relatively less environmentally motivated to adopt the Fairtrade system. Flowever, female coffee farmers are significantly more environmentally driven to adopt Fairtrade certification. Surprisingly, the results suggest that farmers' level of education has no significant influence on their motivation for Fairtrade certification. Moreover, lower-income and smaller-scale coffee farmers are less economically and environmentally motivated for Fairtrade certification. In light of these findings, we suggest that efforts to promote Fairtrade certification among smallholder growers should be designed in ways that balance economic, social, and environmental outcomes. Furthermore, the findings call for targeted measures to strengthen Fairtrade's commitment to empowering disadvantaged smallholder farmers, including women, to achieve sustainable development goals in the region.

TI  - Does joint agricultural decision-making improve food security among smallholder farmers?
T2  - AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW
AB  - Household agricultural decision-making is crucial in navigating household food insecurity amid increasing climate change and variability. In smallholder farming contexts in Ghana and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), decision-making is often the culturally ascribed role of the male family head. Yet joint household decision-making has the potential to leverage the diverse knowledge and capacities of household members to meet the nutritional and dietary needs of households. Using a cross-sectional survey involving 1100 smallholder farmer households, we examined the association between intra-household decision-making arrangements and food security in northern Ghana. Results from the logistic regression analysis indicated that households that practiced joint decision-making (OR = 1.71; p <= 0.001) had significantly higher odds of being food secure compared to households that practiced sole decision-making. Other noteworthy socio-economic and agricultural practices that were significantly associated with household food security included household size, marriage type, wealth, and post-harvest loss. The findings have demonstrated that household decision-making arrangements influence how household members negotiate and reconcile preferences in the allocation of resources and consequentially household food security outcomes. Therefore, policies that seek to address food insecurity and other socio-economic challenges in such contexts must critically consider household decision-making arrangements. Gender transformative policy approaches that are inclusive of both women and men in a comprehensive dialog on collective cooperation in household decision-making and control of productive resources should be employed.

TI  - Socio-economic Impacts of Smallholder Tree Farming in the Caraga Administrative Region, Philippines
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Tree farming is becoming infamous among smallholders in the Caraga Administrative Region, the acclaimed "timber corridor" ofthe Philippines. Despite the region's favorable biophysical condition to tree farming, attractive Cash benefits, and market availability compared to other regions of the country, tree farming has become less attractive to smallholders. The smallholders remainedpoor and marginalized even as the region's poverty incidence continually declined in the last three decades. This study seeks to determine the socioeconomic impacts of sinallholder tree farming in the region. Using both qualitative and quantitative analyses, the study revealed that tree and non-tree farmers alike perceived positive and statistically significant changes on livelihood sources, income, equity, asset accumulation, education, level of trust, reciprocity and cohesiveness in the community as a result of tree farming. However, although income was improved with tree farming, benefits were considered inequitable among different stakeholders; those endowed with financial capital captured much of the economic benefits. Worse, the lack offinancial resources has led some smallholder tree farmers to accommodate arrangements such as dependence on the purchase order (PO) holders who have control over the price oflogs that put them into a disadvantaged situation, which consequently locked them in impoverished condition. The study recommends the institutionalization ofan effective need-oriented extension programfor smallholder tree farmers, investment in market diversification and vertical integration of tree products to make smallholder tree farming more sustainable and equitable.

TI  - Smartphone use, off-farm employment, and women's decision-making power: Evidence from rural China
T2  - REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - Empowering women is an important goal of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, and studies have proposed various strategies to achieve this goal. However, few have examined the role of smartphone use in empowering women in decision-making and its mechanism. Therefore, this study analyzes how smartphone use affects women's decision-making power and explores whether this influence is due to women's off-farm employment mechanisms. For this purpose, the study uses the survey data of 1110 households in rural China and the endogenous treatment regression model for analysis. The control function approach addresses the selection bias of off-farm employment. The results show that smartphone use significantly increases women's decision-making power, partially channeled through increasing women's off-farm employment. The mechanism effect is robust to using both binary and intensive measurements of off-farm employment. Therefore, a policy to improve access to internet facilities and smartphone use could improve women's decision-making power through employment in the off-farm sector.

TI  - Are agriculture and nutrition policies and practice coherent? Stakeholder evidence from Afghanistan
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Despite recent improvements in the national average, stunting levels in Afghanistan exceed 70% in some Provinces. Agriculture serves as the main source of livelihood for over half of the population and has the potential to be a strong driver of a reduction in under-nutrition. This article reports research conducted through interviews with stakeholders in agriculture and nutrition in the capital, Kabul, and four provinces of Afghanistan, to gain a better understanding of the institutional and political factors surrounding policy making and the nutrition-sensitivity of agriculture. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a total of 46 stakeholders from central government and four provinces, including staff from international organizations, NGOs and universities. We found evidence of interdisciplinary communication at the central level and within Provinces, but little evidence of vertical coordination in policy formulation and implementation between the centre and Provinces. Policy formulation and decision making were largely sectoral, top-down, and poorly contextualised. The weaknesses identified in policy formulation, focus, knowledge management, and human and financial resources inhibit the orientation of national agricultural development strategies towards nutrition-sensitivity. Integrating agriculture and nutrition policies requires explicit leadership from the centre. However, effectiveness of a food-based approach to reducing nutrition insecurity will depend on decentralising policy ownership to the regions and provinces through stronger subnational governance. Security and humanitarian considerations point to the need to manage and integrate in a deliberate way the acute humanitarian care and long-term development needs, of which malnutrition is just one element.

TI  - Outgrowers and Livelihoods: The Case of Magobbo Smallholder Block Farming in Mazabuka District in Zambia
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - Outgrower schemes are increasingly seen as a way to empower smallholders economically, while addressing their production constraints. This article examines an outgrower sugar cane scheme in Zambia officially launched in 2008 with substantial grant funding from the European Union. In this case, the outgrowers are not involved in the production, but pass their land in a block to be managed by a company. This acts as an extension of the nucleus estate, with dividends paid according to a collective contract. The scheme, and associated grant funding, has proved highly beneficial for Zambia Sugar Plc, owned by South African multinational Illovo Sugar (which became wholly owned by Associated British Foods in June 2016). The new outgrowers are increasingly differentiated: some are former dryland farmers, whereas others are outsiders from nearby towns. Some have benefited significantly, with opportunities for accumulation. Others have not, as dividends have been shared by an increasing number of family members. Intra-household distribution of sugar income has exposed gender differences, as it is mostly men who are the designated shareholders. Moreover, the new wealth flowing from the scheme has provoked political contestation within the community, as some seek to exert control over the scheme. Thus, the sugar block scheme has radically changed agrarian relations in the area. There are higher incomes for some - and a seeming success of the outgrower model - but this comes at a cost, as land, livelihoods and social relations are reconfigured.

TI  - Social construction of the environment and smallholder farmers' participation in 'low-carbon', agro-industrial crop production contracts in the Philippines
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Several studies have suggested that socio-economic factors and production site characteristics are primary determinants of farmers' participation in 'low-carbon', agro-industrial (biofuels and oil palm) production contracts. In the Philippines, many smallholder farmers have expressed their intent to participate in intensive production of biofuel crops and oil palm with state and private organizations; others have resisted or remained indifferent. This study looks into smallholders' social construction of the environment and how this may influence their decisions to participate in such production contracts. The study is based on a survey of 462 respondents in eight communities in the province of Palawan. Using regression analysis, it illustrates how smallholders' sense of place and environmental worldviews, together with demographic and socio-economic variables, play significant roles in their decisions to enter into new biofuels (jatropha) and oil palm production contracts. Environmental worldviews are significant when there are strong negative perceptions attached to a particular crop production contract, as in the case of oil palm. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Economic and environmental consequences' of postharvest loss across food supply Chain in the developing countries
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Reducing Food losses and waste (FLW) is a key global challenge to ensure sufficient food for the future and to use available natural resources more efficiently. This study based on the primary data collected from 343 tomato supply chain actors' in Egypt. We adopted the life cycle assessment approach and the category method (C-Method) to estimate the percentage of postharvest losses (PHL) and their economic and environmental impacts. The result revealed the average percentage of PHL is 8.8%,8.6%,7.5%,13.36% and 11.63% for the farmers, processors, village traders', wholesalers and retailers respectively. The total land and water used to produce this lost food estimated around 80 thousand hectares and 306 million cubic meters, besides the other production inputs. Which cost the Egyptian economy about 449$ million annually and emits 4.5 million tons of CO(2)eq. The study highlights the importance of prevention strategies is better than recovering ones to mitigate the economic and environmental impacts of FLW. Additionally, diversity of the marketing channels for perishables could contribute to lessen the percentage of PHL through reducing unsold share, meet the consumers' preferences and providing greater marketing opportunities for small farmers. This study suggests the intervention of mitigation PHL should include the different actors from the farmers to retailers. Adopting a short supply chain, collective marketing, access to cold transportation and storage services, that could maintain product quality and extending its shelf-life. Agricultural education is essential for disseminating the best agricultural practices including the postharvest operations for perishable products. Therefore, design sustainable intervention strategies require intensive public-private partnership and it should include incentives for small stakeholders. That could raise their knowledge, improve their skills and practices, and change their attitudes to be more sustainable users for the limited natural resources.

TI  - DEMYTHIFYING CONTRACT FARMING: EVIDENCE FROM RURAL SOUTH AFRICA
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - This paper intends to contribute to the ongoing debate about whether and how restructured agri-food markets can provide viable market opportunities for small-scale farmers in South Africa. It analyses contract farming from the small-scale farmer perspective to better understand the implications for small-scale farmers of contractual arrangements with processing and/or marketing firms.
   The paper, based on empirical research conducted in the Limpopo Province of South Africa using a combination of qualitative and econometric analyses, argues that contract farming is not a panacea for small-scale farmers. On the one hand, contract farming improves agricultural production for contract farmers who benefit from increased incomes, enables better access to services and resources, and creates new opportunities to participate in markets. However, on the other hand, the results show that contract farming remains limited and mostly involves the already better-off, who have benefitted from specific development paths and public support. This case study shows that contract farming in itself does not appear to provide an efficient means of reducing poverty, nor does it provide an institutional tool through which to improve rural livelihoods. It does, therefore, not represent a tool appropriate for the majority of small farmers or for redressing the historical imbalances in the South African agricultural sector.

TI  - On-farm assessment of different rice crop management practices in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, using sustainability performance indicators
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB  - The intensification of rice production in the Mekong delta (MKD) has helped to address food security in Vietnam and in the region. However, the overuse of inputs coupled with the rising production costs are making it increasingly difficult for smallholder rice farming in the MKD to remain economically and environmentally sustainable. Thus, there is a widely recognized need to improve the sustainability of rice cultivation in the delta. Since 2003, the Vietnam Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development has led several initiatives to improve rice crop management practices in the MKD, including the 'One Must Do, Five Reductions' (1M5R) integrated technology package and the 'Small Farmer Large Field' (SFLF) model. Under the SFLF model, some contract farming with high-quality rice exporters in MKD are also based on Good Agriculture Practice (GAP) standards, such as GlobalGAP and VietGAP, that farmers must follow for accreditation.
   As part of an adaptive research platform, we conducted a household survey of GAP (VietGAP and GlobalGAP), SFLF and conventional (CNV) farmers in Can Tho province in the MKD and established replicated productionscale field trials of 1M5R, with an emphasis on further reducing seed and pesticide inputs by applying limits on their use. We assessed the sustainability performance of 1M5R and the three different management approaches for rice production (i.e. GAP, SFLF and CNV) over two rice cropping seasons using eight farm-level Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) performance indicators.
   We demonstrated that application of 1M5R with clear limits for input use can substantially improve the sustainability of rice production in the MKD through reducing inputs that can have environmentally negative impacts (i.e. fertilizers and pesticides). In the treatment fields, mean total production cost per season fell by 23% (203 USD ha(-1)) and mean net income increased by 19% (175 USD ha(-1)), resulting in a 28% increase in the benefit: cost ratio. Five of eight farm-level SRP indicators showed an improvement in sustainability performance, whilst yield, labor productivity and water productivity were maintained. Farmers implementing GAP and SFLF management approaches were slightly more sustainable than CNV farmers, although there is scope for further improvement, especially with regards to reducing rice seed and pesticide application rates. We propose possible strategies to increase adoption of more sustainable crop management practices in the MKD.

TI  - Beyond fixes that fail: identifying sustainable improvements to tree seed supply and farmer participation in forest and landscape restoration
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Growing evidence suggests that constraints to the availability and quality of tree seed can undermine the success of forest and landscape restoration efforts and the delivery of associated benefits such as mitigating climate change and halting biodiversity loss. Past experiences to promote tree seed supply have frequently shown limited outcomes over time, partly because of unexpected, deleterious dynamics that emerged from the interventions themselves. In this study, we used a dynamic system approach to understand the interrelated problems that constrain the supply of good quality and site-adapted tree seeds to meet smallholders' and other stakeholders' demand in Burkina Faso and the Philippines, and to identify leverage points for intervention. Causal loop diagrams were constructed for each country, based on a framework of indicators of effective tree seed supply systems, literature review, semistructured interviews, and expert validation. The diagrams illustrate the complex interactions between planned interventions and their expected and unexpected effects that frequently lead to adverse outcomes. For example, the high turnover of forestry officers in municipalities to combat corruption in Burkina Faso combined with limited resources to support smallholders undermined the officers' ability to strengthen local capacities in seedling production and sustainable forest management. In the Philippines, the imposition of rigid requirements for seedling survival rates as a condition for funding, in the absence of adequate time and resources for the production of quality seedlings and monitoring, resulted in exaggerated survival rates during reporting, which in turn hampered the detection and addressing of shortcomings. A dynamic system approach can help stakeholders recognize the broader impacts of their actions and jointly identify appropriate interventions, from developing more context-specific approaches to reconsidering investment criteria to balance benefits.

TI  - Panama disease and contract farming in the Philippines: Towards a political ecology of risk
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRARIAN CHANGE
AB  - Despite the vast research on contract farming by agrarian scholars, little is known about interactions between biological risks and the social-political effects of contracts. This study analysed contract farming arrangements in the export banana industry in the Philippines amidst an expanding epidemic of Panama disease. We developed a political ecology of risk approach to investigate how ideas about technological and biological risks are influenced by contractual arrangements, and we borrowed from Cultural Theory the insight that risk and blame are connected concepts, always political, and disadvantage marginalized groups through disproportionate risk burdens. Data collection involved the study of contracts, interviews with decision-makers, and focus group discussions with agrarian cooperatives. The views of both large corporations as well as organized smallholders were recorded. We found that the former contractually compel the latter to bear the burden of the disease, while blaming them for its spread. Risk decisions were embedded in the dynamics of agrarian social relationships, and economic and political arrangements between actors influenced possibilities and limitations for disease control. We argue that the contractual stipulations, in concert with blaming processes, create a discursive environment that both allow inequitable relations to remain unquestioned, and constrain possibilities for control of Panama disease.

TI  - The Legacy of Agrarian Reform in Latin America: Foundations of the Fair Trade Cooperative System
T2  - GEOGRAPHY COMPASS
AB  - Cooperatives are essential to the success of fair trade because small farmers must be organized into cooperatives in order to be certified. Fair trade aims to empower small farmers, yet many farmers are only able to obtain fair trade certification because they fought for land and organized themselves into strong cooperatives through state-led agrarian reform programs. To explore the link between agrarian reform and fair trade, I review the history of agrarian reform in Nicaragua, describing how many of the country's fair trade-certified cooperatives have roots in the reform programs of the 1980s. The review contributes to a broader historical perspective on the cooperative system at the heart of fair trade. It brings together scholarship with archived magazine articles to explore the connection between the contemporary fair trade system and the hard-won successes of peasant movements for land reform.

TI  - Making Climate Science More Useful for Decision-Making: A Synthesis of Multidisciplinary Perspectives from Case Studies with Smallholder Farmers in the Philippines
T2  - PHILIPPINE AGRICULTURAL SCIENTIST
AB  - There is a compelling case to make advances in climate science useful for one of the most exposed and vulnerable communities, the Philippine smallholder farmer. The Philippine government's investment in the modernization of PAGASA is consistent with a substantial international effort in weather and climate science. However, these improvements are only of value if they can be communicated and used in decision-making. Collectively the 12 papers in this special issue offer insights into the process of creating value from PAGASA information for smallholder farmers. These 12 papers are drawn from case studies in two contrasting farming systems: high-value vegetable production in Benguet, and the corn and rice production in Mindoro. The papers have a common focus on the use of weather and climate information for smallholder farmers, but they apply various methods from the social sciences (social network analysis, key informant interviews, gender analysis) and applied economics (risk matrices, simulation model, decision analysis, and value of information). The resulting insights are cross-disciplinary, consisting of a research team of Philippine and Australian colleagues, cross-national. We conclude this synthesis paper by drawing together what was learned in specific contexts and what this might offer other applied researchers in the Philippines, Australia and globally as they seek to make the advances in climate science useful to decision makers.

TI  - Understanding farmers? willingness in arable land protection cooperation by using fsQCA: Roles of perceived benefits and policy incentives
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB  - Under small-scale farming operations, farmers' willingness in arable land protection cooperation (FWALPC) is a feasible way to realize the trinity protection of arable land in China. However, farmers often fall into the dilemma of collective action due to lack of motivation and free-riding behavior. On the basis of the configuration perspective, this paper conducted a questionnaire survey on 197 farmers in Xingning City by using the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method to explore the causal complex mechanism of the seven antecedent conditions of perceived benefits and policy incentives on the FWALPC. Results show the following: (1) Among individual factors, perceived economic benefits, policy subsidies, and government propaganda constitute the necessary conditions for the FWALPC. (2) The drive path of high-level FWALPC can be divided into four types: perceived ecological benefits leading type, perceived social benefits leading type, perceived emotional benefit-government regulation leading type, and government propaganda leading type. (3) The driving path of low-level FWALPC has one type and has a causal asymmetry relationship with high-level FWALPC. This research enriches and develops the relevant theories of collective action behavior of small farmers, and provides a new perspective for how land managers can improve FWALPC.

TI  - Vertical coordination and post-harvest losses: Implications on food loss
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES AND POLICY
AB  - This study investigates contract farming's impact on smallholders' profits and post-harvest losses (PHLs). The study uses an endogenous switching regression (ESR) and farm-level data from okra growers located in two different districts in India. Results show that okra growers under production contract (PC) or marketing contract (MC) have higher profits and PHLs than independent okra growers. However, under a low rejection-rate scenario, growers under PC or MC have significantly lower PHLs and increased profits. The reduction in PHLs is not surprising, but the magnitude of the decrease shows that rejection rates are the major contributor to PHLs for contracted growers. Thus, contract farming with low rejection reduces PHLs and increases the profits of smallholdersa win-win situation for growers and contracting firms.

TI  - Size isn't everything: narratives of scale and viability in a Tanzanian irrigation scheme
T2  - JOURNAL OF MODERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB  - This paper explores tensions over scale and viability in irrigated agricultural development in Tanzania. A revival of ambition to transform African agriculture has reawakened debate over what type of agriculture can best deliver increased production and poverty reduction for rural populations. This paper examines these debates through the lens of an ethnographic study of an irrigated rice farm in Tanzania. With a chequered history of state and donor intervention management, Dakawa, Rice Farm in Mvomero District is now collectively farmed by a cooperative society of 'small farmers'. It is widely hailed as a success, both of irrigation production, and of 'small farmers' in delivering this. However, such narratives of smallness and success obscure a more complex reality in which smallness of scale may be more of a discursive tool than a reflection of empirical reality. Although notions of 'viability' and 'success' in such development interventions are themselves also contested and depend on perspective, there is evidence that there are fundamental problems of both short- and long-term viability.

TI  - Income Inequality of Oil Palm Plasma Farmers in South Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - One of the critical policies to encourage oil palm development in Indonesia is the Nucleus Estate Smallholders Project. This project involves engaging farmer organizations in operating and managing oil palm plantations. However, there are gaps in the organizational performance of plasma farmer cooperatives, which consequently affect oil palm productivity and farmers' welfare. This paper analyzes the income gaps among oil palm plasma farmers who are associated with state and private companies in Musi Banyuasin regency, South Sumatra, Indonesia. The results of the analysis show that the income of plasma farmers from the private company is higher than that of the state company plasma farmers. The type of nucleus company has a significant effect on the plasma farm households' income due to the differences in the organizational performance of the private- and state-sponsored cooperatives and the differences in the nucleus-plasma farmer relations. The cooperative that operates in a private company performs well, whereas the cooperative in a state company has ceased its operations. This research also found out that the number of household working members, income share from oil palm production, and land area have significant effects on the income of plasma farm households.

TI  - Un/associated: Accounting for gender difference and farmer heterogeneity among Peruvian Sierra potato small farmers
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Recognizing the challenges faced by small farmers, international institutions have encouraged national governments to foster the collective organization of small farmers and farmer membership through policy interventions that target rural populations, and more specifically 'women' and 'marginalized farmers'. Yet, access to membership continues to elude the most disadvantaged small farmers. Based on Peru's 2012 National Agricultural Census, we conduct a comparative analysis of small Peruvian potato farmers to identify the social markers that influence membership status. We conduct cross-group (women versus men) and intra-group (among women and among men) comparisons to tease out gender difference and farmer heterogeneity and the social markers that account for exclusion. We suggest that considering women and marginalized farmers as homogeneous and residual populations obscures the social markers that differentiate small farmers homogenizing women as a group and rendering some men and masculine gendered practices analytically invisible. This study contributes to the literature on gender and the collective organization of farmers by highlighting gender difference and farmer heterogeneity and points to gender-based inequality as well as other forms of inequality that influence the membership status. Our analysis shows that men comprise a larger proportion of potato farmers, yet the membership status of women and men is nearly equal and that associated women farmers hold the highest percentage of land titles while unassociated men hold the lowest. We also find a large number of districts without the presence of associated women potato farmers indicating the existence of gender-based spatial inequality. Our analysis of household composition points to the feminization of women farmer households due to the absence of male partners and a large presence of elderly women in comparison to men farmer households. Unlike for men, the presence of a partner and/or elderly household members has no effect on women's membership status. Similarly, the presence of girls (and not boys) under six years of age has a negative effect only for women's membership. We also find that for women, it is more important to have higher levels of education than men to participate in farmer organizations. Our intra-group comparisons indicate unassociated and associated women are differentiated based on a combination of social markers including education, economic and domestic partnership, language and land ownership. Overall, our analysis shows that while gender based inequality persists, there are other cross-cutting markers of social differentiation among women and men that influence farmer membership status.

TI  - What Awaits Myanmar's Uplands Farmers? Lessons Learned from Mainland Southeast Asia
T2  - LAND
AB  - Mainland Southeast Asia (MSA) has seen sweeping upland land use changes in the past decades, with transition from primarily subsistence shifting cultivation to annual commodity cropping. This transition holds implications for local upland communities and ecosystems. Due to its particular political regime, Myanmar is at the tail of this development. However, with Myanmar's official strategy of agricultural commercialization and intensification, recent liberalization of the national economy, and influx of multinational agricultural companies, the effects on upland land transitions could come fast. We analyze the current state of upland land use in Myanmar in a socio-economic and political context, identify the dynamics in three indicator commodity crops (maize, cassava, and rubber), and discuss the state driven economic, tenurial and policy reforms that have occurred in upland areas of mainland Southeast Asian countries in past decades. We draw on these insights to contextualize our study and hypothesize about possible transition pathways for Myanmar. The transition to annual commodity cropping is generally driven by a range of socio-economic and technical factors. We find that land use dynamics for the three indicator crops are associated with market demand and thus the opening of national Southeast-Asian economies, research and development of locally suitable high yielding varieties (HYVs), and subsidies for the promotion of seeds and inputs. In contrast, promotion of HYVs in marginal areas and without adequate agricultural extension services may results in agricultural contraction and yield dis-intensification. The environmental impacts of the transition depend on the transition pathway, e.g., through large-scale plantation projects or smallholder initiatives. The agricultural development in upland MSA follows a clear diffusion pattern with transition occurring first in Thailand, spreading to Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. While these countries point to prospects for Myanmar, we hypothesize that changes will come slow due to Myanmar's sparse rural infrastructure, with uncertainty about tenure, in particular in areas still troubled by armed conflicts, and unwillingness of international investors to approach Myanmar given the recent setbacks to the democratization process.

TI  - Economic returns to households participating in different models of commercial tree plantations in Lao PDR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB  - Four tree plantation models implemented in Lao PDR and a hypothetical model were compared in terms of the projected economic benefits and those realised by participating rural households, and households' attitudes to further plantation expansion. Models comprised two forms of land-sharing plantation concessions, and contract and independent tree growing. Benefits and costs over the plantation cycle were used to calculate net present values. Tree plantations contributed most to household livelihoods when companies engaged in a participatory land use planning process, where opportunities for household labour were greatest. and where plantation models allowed for intercropping by households. In contrast, where contracts were not honoured, crops cannot be grown jointly, or labour opportunities arc limited, returns were not competitive with traditional swidden agriculture. Households were generally open to expansion of more beneficial models. These results suggest a set of principles for developing locally appropriate and beneficial tree plantation systems in Lao PDR.

TI  - Household, community, and policy determinants of food insecurity in rural Malawi
T2  - DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB  - This study examines how socio-economic characteristics of households, local conditions, and public programmes are associated with the probability that a farm household in rural Malawi is food insecure. The statistical analysis uses nationally representative data for 8350 randomly-selected households interviewed during 2004/05 for the second Malawi Integrated Household Survey. Regressions are estimated separately for households in the north, centre, and south of Malawi to account for spatial heterogeneity. Results of a multilevel logit model reveal that households are less likely to be food insecure if they have larger cultivated land per capita, receive agricultural field assistance, reside in a community with an agricultural cooperative and relatively high annual rainfall, and are headed by an individual with a high school degree. Factors that positively correlate with household food insecurity are price of maize, price of fertiliser, number of household members, and distance to markets. Implications of these findings for policy are discussed.

TI  - Do so-called sustainable standards impoverish cocoa farmers? Interactions between deforestation, credit for fertilizer purchase and falling prices
T2  - CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB  - For centuries, combined with the work of migrants, forests and forest rent have been the main factors of production of cocoa. This is the universal cocoa model, which has made Cote d'Ivoire the world's leading producer. However, the level of deforestation is such that some of the cocoa smallholders must find alternatives to the forest rent, including mineral fertilizer, potentially a factor in improving yields and, a priori, their income. However, in case the "system" - made up of cocoa Transnational Corporations (TNCs), cooperatives, credit agencies, international non-governmental organizations and so-called "sustainable" cocoa labels - drives up the consumption of chemical fertilizers, will there not be a danger of the opposite effect taking place: contribution to the excess supply of cocoa, drop in world prices, and indebtedness and impoverishment of the smallholders? Based on three surveys of 150 to 250 growers between 2013 and 2017, a survey of 41 cooperatives in 2017, and the monitoring of cocoa and fertilizer prices over 30 years, this study addresses the role of the cocoa/fertilizer relative price and credit on fertilizer consumption and their impact on the drop in cocoa prices in 2016-2017. The impact is undeniable, even though the process of cocoa expansion through migration and deforestation remains the essential factor behind the increase in supply and the fall in price. The argument that yield gains will create "sustainable cocoa" and deter smallholders from clearing forests remains an illusion. Migration continues at the expense of the country's very last classified forests, east to Abengourou, west to Blolequin, Man and Touba. Again, despite their communication on sustainability and environment-friendly practices, certifications have totally failed. Cocoa in Cote d'Ivoire still depends heavily on deforestation. Finally, on the other side of the Cavally River, Liberia's large dense forest is disappearing in turn, on the way to a new cocoa boom. Even if public policies are partly responsible, what is left of "sustainability" in the certification and actions of the majority of TNCs? The gap between their virtual communication and reality has never been greater.

TI  - Cross-scale relationships between social capital and women's participation in decision-making on the farm: A multilevel study in semi-arid Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Social capital develops through relations between people and groups within community social networks. Women in smallholder agrarian communities often draw on social capital to influence their intra-household bargaining positions, with significant implications for their resource access. However, the extent to which women use different types of social capital to increase their participation in agricultural decision-making remain understudied. This research examines the relationships between women's participation in agricultural decision-making and bonding, bridging, and linking social capital and how broader contextual factors can interact with the pathways through which social capital functions in rural semi-arid Kenya. In 2014, we collected and analyzed quantitative and qualitative data: household (N = 206) and community (n = 127) surveys, key informant interviews (n = 77), twelve focus group discussions, and eight community meetings. Results indicate that women draw on bridging social capital to increase the diversity of their information and training sources. We found that women's participation in decision-making has a positive association with bonding social capital and a negative association with linking social capital. Multilevel analysis reveals cross-scale interactions between poverty prevalence and social capital on women's decision-making participation. Findings suggest that advances in regional development have the potential to amplify the stock and usage of social capital for women's empowerment in smallholder agrarian systems.

TI  - Does commitment to cooperatives affect the economic benefits of smallholder farmers? Evidence from rice cooperatives in the Western province of Zambia
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - Using local provincial authorities, the government of Zambia has demonstrated renewed interest in cooperatives as a means of reaching smallholder farmers in rural areas. There exists, however, the problem of high heterogeneity within cooperatives regarding members' commitment, with many passive members holding only formal membership and having a minimal understanding of the cooperative's principles and benefits. The main objective of this study was to analyse how varying levels of members' commitment determine their economic benefits. We selected a total of 215 rice farmers (72 active and 143 passive members) from two rice-dominant districts and used the propensity score matching technique and endogenous treatment regression model for the analysis. The study results show that educational level, distance to the cooperative, members' perception about trust and acceptance, and value of the investment in the cooperative have a considerable influence on member commitment. The results further indicate that actively committed members of the cooperative achieve much more economic benefits than passive members.

TI  - Resources at marriage and intrahousehold allocation: Evidence from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and South Africa
T2  - OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS
AB  - We test the unitary versus collective model of the household using specially designed data from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and South Africa. Human capital and individual assets at the time of marriage are used as proxy measures,for bargaining power. In all four countries, we reject the unitary model as a description of household behaviour, but fail to reject the hypothesis that households are Pareto-efficient. In Bangladesh and South Africa, women's assets increase expenditure shares on education, while in Ethiopia it is men's assets that have this effect. These increases. have different implications for boys and girls across countries, however.

TI  - Small farmer cooperatives and voluntary coffee certifications: Rewarding progressive farmers of engendering widespread change in Costa Rica?
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Our research examines the benefits and drawbacks for cooperatives who participate in voluntary coffee certifications. We interviewed administrators at twenty Costa Rican coffee cooperatives about management practices related to voluntary certification. Voluntary certifications are popular among coffee cooperatives. Access to certified markets is facilitated by state support of the cooperative sector, regulation of the coffee sector and well-enforced environmental and social laws. However, there are no significant or consistent financial incentives for farmers to pursue certification. Multiple certifications may lower auditing and implementation costs, but cooperatives rarely receive the full premium for multiply-certified coffee. Low market demand for certified coffee, weak price incentives and high auditing and management costs encourage cooperatives to certify only a portion of their members. This strategy rewards compliant farmers rather than inducing widespread change to farming practices among the entire membership. Though financial incentives are weak, certifications offer non-financial benefits to both farmers and cooperatives, including better management and more resilient cooperatives. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Global-Local Tensions in Contract Farming of Biofuel Crops Involving Indigenous Communities in the Philippines
T2  - SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
AB  - Farming of biofuel crops by local communities under contract with parastatal and private firms is being established in the Philippines and elsewhere. This study explores tensions in integrating indigenous peoples into the global biofuels network. Drawing from critical perspectives on contract farming and from the environmental sociology of networks and flows, we examine production relations associated with contract farming of Jatropha on indigenous lands in the Philippines. In on-site observations and interviews, we found that while some indigenous groups grow Jatropha in polyculture, shifting-cultivation systems as part of biofuel contracts, these smallholder production systems are being phased out or transformed by the global biofuels network. In contract farming relationships involving biofuel crops, there seems to be a greater tendency for indigenous peoples to adapt to, or be left outside of, global production networks than for the latter to include indigenous peoples in socially and ecologically sustainable ways.

TI  - Does the Adoption of Mobile Internet Technology Promote Wheat Productivity? Evidence from Rural Farmers
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The adoption of mobile Internet technology (MIT) in organizational systems is rapidly increasing. MIT has developed agricultural structures and dramatically altered farming activities to improve agricultural systems. MIT is considered one of the most essential technologies because of its huge impact on agriculture, economy, and our daily lives. In this study, we utilized sample data from 460 wheat growers in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province of Pakistan to analyze the adoption of MIT and its impact on the promotion of wheat productivity. This study used the propensity score matching (PSM) technique to address probable self-selection bias. Existing research outcomes show that decision making, education, farm size, cooperative membership, gender, extension services, access to credit, weather forecast information, risk perception, market distance, and other factors significantly affect productivity and subsidy awareness agendas. However, outcomes signify that MIT adoption will have a significant positive impact on wheat productivity. This research concludes with a policy impact, emphasizing that it is essential to accelerate MIT adoption by wheat growers as a policy to enhance Pakistan's agriculture or wheat productivity and food security.

TI  - Transferring irrigation management to farmer's associations: Evidence from the Philippines
T2  - WATER POLICY
AB  - Irrigation management transfer (HAT) is an important strategy among donors and governments that aims to strengthen farmer control over water and irrigation infrastructure. In this study. we use data from a survey of 68 irrigator associations (IAs) and 1020 farm households in the Philippines to examine the impact of IMT on irrigation association performance and on rice yields We find that the presence of IMT is associated with an increase in maintenance activities undertaken by irrigation associations While associations with and without IMT contracts undertake canal maintenance. the frequency of maintenance in IMT IAs is higher IMT presence is also associated with an increase in farm yields by about 6%, rice production in IMT areas is higher even after we control for various differences amongst rice farmers in IMT and non-IMT areas Finally. IMT may even give poorer farmers a small boost in terms of rice yields We speculate that this boost may be a result of improved water delivery and better resolution of conflicts related to illegal use.

TI  - Why do Farmers Prefer Oil Palm? Lessons Learnt from Bungo District, Indonesia
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
AB  - Indonesia has been the world's largest producer and exporter of palm oil since 2008. This paper discussed the livelihood impacts of oil palm development in Indonesia, based on lessons learnt from Bungo district, in the province of Jambi. The various community-company partnerships that structure the sector are reviewed and the difficulties raised by the joint ventures schemes are discussed. The merits and drawbacks of oil palm as a smallholder crop are then analysed, based on household socio-economic surveys conducted in 2007-2010. The main causes of conflicts between oil palm companies and communities are unclear land tenure, and a recurrent lack of leadership in smallholders' cooperatives. Under fair partnerships between smallholders and companies, oil palm could become a smallholder friendly crop. The land-use profitability analysis demonstrates the high returns that can be generated by oil palm independent smallholdings, making it highly competitive with rubber, and much more profitable than rice production.

TI  - Rural schools as effective hubs for agricultural technology dissemination: experimental evidence from Tanzania and Uganda
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Increasing agricultural productivity by promoting high-yielding and micronutrient-rich crop varieties has the potential to reduce poverty and malnutrition. However, getting these technologies into the hands of smallholders remains a challenge. This paper presents results from a randomised field experiment that uses rural primary schools as dissemination hubs for improved orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) vines and nutrition information in rural Tanzania and Uganda. Two years after the initial vine distribution, we find that households in treatment villages are 21 percentage points more likely to report growing OFSP and 27 percentage points more likely to correctly state the nutritional benefits of OFSP compared to those in control villages. We also find up to 16 percentage point increase in the likelihood of OFSP consumption by children under 5 years of age in treatment villages compared to that in control villages. Furthermore, we find suggestive evidence that increased knowledge on the nutritional benefits of OFSP mediated up to a third of the total treatment effect on OFSP adoption and consumption. Our findings suggest that rural primary schools can be effective channels for promoting and accelerating the diffusion of micronutrient-rich crop varieties in rural areas.

TI  - Diagnosing Participation and Inclusion in Collective Decision-Making in the Commons: Lessons from Ecuador
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS
AB  - The objectives of our study are to advance our understanding of the micro-level governance conditions that facilitate more inclusive communal decision-making processes. Common -pool resource scholars frequently point to participatory governance arrangements as critical for successful resource management. Recognizing local decision-making rights, however, does not necessarily ensure that the decision process or management outcomes will be inclusive or equitable. Examples from decentralized and community -based resource management illustrate how communities and outside organizations alike can struggle to create decision-making forums that include and recognize the voices of more marginalized members. Our exploratory analysis examines household participation (n = 491) in communal decisions in twelve rural indigenous communities in the central Andes of Ecuador. We use the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework to structure a set of logit models to identify the household attributes and community governance conditions that make it more likely that a household engages in community meetings (attends, voices opinions, perceives opinion is respected), and agrees with the collective decisions. Our findings reiterate the challenge of gaining full participation, particularly from women, and indicate how local governance characteristics such as frequency of meetings and leader training may promote greater inclusion and overall agreement with communal decisions.

TI  - Empowering Smallholder Farmers in Markets: strengthening the advocacy capacities of national farmer organisations through collaborative research
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - The Empowering Smallholder Farmers in Markets programme (ESFIM) supported the advocacy capacities of national farmer organisations (NFOs) for improving smallholder market access. The programme gave NFOs in 11 countries the opportunity to contract local experts to strengthen the evidence-base of their advocacy proposals. By means of a participative process, each NFO analysed the key advocacy issues for which research support was most needed. This resulted in a diversity of themes and advocacy processes. These ranged from research and advocacy on the role of cooperatives in Uruguayan innovation policies to a simulation game on market dynamics in a commodity exchange in the Philippines, and from the review of various seed multiplication programmes in Malawi to the legal and administrative hurdles preventing smallholders from selling to government procurement programmes in Peru and Bolivia. We describe the dynamics surrounding research partnerships in each of the 11 countries and reflect on results of this research-for-advocacy. We also assess the impact of the ESFIM programme on the advocacy capacity of the NFOs. We used a self-evaluation technique, in which board members considered a list of statements covering five capacities that are deemed necessary for effective advocacy. We compared their scores with the observations of external stakeholders who were active in the agricultural sector and knowledgeable about the NFOs' activities. We conclude that ESFIM has helped to increase coherence in advocacy priorities and has influenced decision making on key policy issues, with encouraging results. In most organisations, ESFIM contributed to the advocacy process, together with many other actors and factors defining advocacy. Based on these experiences, we suggest earmarking funds for NFO-led research support, in order to facilitate the participation of smallholders in the design and monitoring of development policies.

TI  - Collective action and rural poverty reduction: Empirical evidence from kwazulu-natal, South Africa
T2  - AGREKON
AB  - Organising smallholder farmers into groups has become an important and preferred mechanism through which the South African government and other rural development agencies seek to address rural poverty and household food insecurity. This study investigates whether collective action through farmer groups has improved incomes among rural farming households in South Africa. The propensity score matching (PSM) method and the treatment effect approach were used to analyse a sample of 984 rural households from four districts in KwaZulu-Natal. The PSM results indicated that participation in farmer groups significantly and positively influenced household incomes. Group membership increased the average household incomes per adult equivalent by about R3000. However, the Rosenbaum bounds tests indicated that the impact estimates obtained using the PSM approach were not robust to hidden bias. The treatment effect regression model, which controls for hidden bias, was estimated, and the results supported those of PSM. The results also indicated that groups benefit more those who are educated and are males, suggesting a bias against the females and those less educated. The results suggest that organising smallholder farmers into groups can play a positive role in rural poverty reduction. For greater impact, policy makers should promote group formation and participation among smallholder farmers as well as introduce adult literacy classes to improve education levels.

TI  - Multi-agent simulations to explore rules for rural credit in a highland farming community of Northern Thailand
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Multi-agent systems (MAS) open new modelling and analysis perspectives in ecological and social sciences. An original characteristic of the companion modelling (ComMod) approach adopted in this case study is the co-construction and use of a MAS model with and for local stakeholders such as farmers and local administrators. Alternating iteratively field and modelling activities, this approach facilitates collective learning among local stakeholders and between them and the researchers. Combining the use of MAS models with role-playing games (RPG), the described experiment aimed to facilitate collective decision-making in a socially heterogeneous community of small farmers in mountainous Northern Thailand about the local rules for the allocation of rural credit to allow a more equitable and extensive process of expansion of non-erosive perennial crops in a watershed prone to erosion. This paper presents the MAS model and the results of a series of simulations exploring the ecological, social and economic effects of various rules for formal and informal credit suggested by the villagers-participants. Six scenarios considered as pertinent to further explore the participants' suggestions were defined based on different combinations among the following three variables: (i) Duration for the reimbursement of loans, (ii) Mode of allocation of formal credit among three different types of farms, (iii) Configuration of networks of acquaintances for access to informal credit.
   Drawing on this case study, we first elaborate on the potential of bottom-up models such as MAS to analyze the functioning of agricultural systems, in particular farm differentiation and rural credit dynamics. We highlight the ability of MAS to deal with interactions between social and ecological dynamics and to provide an alternative to classical economic thinking by analyzing the effects at the village level of social interactions among individuals. MAS allow us in particular to trigger an overlooked but nevertheless fundamental aspect of socio-ecological systems, i.e. social capital which is a determining factor when dealing with sustainability issues. The second question addressed in this paper deals with the potential and limits of MAS models to support a bottom-up (or participatory) modelling approach. This experiment suggests that the usefulness of models relies much more on the modelling process than on the model itself, because a model is usually useless if it is misunderstood by its potential users, or if it does not respond to their current preoccupations. The intuitive representation of real systems provided by MAS and their high flexibility are the two underlined characteristics favouring their appropriation by local stakeholders.

TI  - 50 Years of Agricultural Mechanization in China
T2  - AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA
AB  - China is a large agricultural country and agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, with hilly and mountainous areas accounting for more than 60%. Most are run by small farmers, but there is also some development of agricultural cooperatives, agricultural machinery cooperatives and family farms. Since 1970, great achievements have been made in the development of agricultural mechanization in China in the past 50 years. China's agricultural machinery and equipment holdings, agricultural mechanization operation level, socialized service level have improved rapidly. China has made major breakthroughs in scientific and technological innovation in agricultural mechanization, and has been significantly enhanced in international cooperation and exchanges. China has a sound legal, regulatory and policy system for agricultural mechanization. Agricultural mechanization has provided strong support for China's food security, the transfer of agricultural labor force, the improvement of agricultural labor productivity, the rapid development of urbanization, and the modernization of agriculture and rural areas. A road of agricultural mechanization has been formed with Chinese characteristics. The environment of China's economic, technological and policy for agricultural mechanization development continue to improve. The priorities of future agricultural mechanization will be placed at developing resource- and labor- saving technologies, shifting focus from production to higher efficiency, as well as from single technologies to integrated technologies, and trend to intelligent agriculture, intelligent agricultural machinery development.

TI  - Do Sustainability Standards Benefit Smallholder Farmers Also When Accounting For Cooperative Effects? Evidence from Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
CP  - Annual Meeting of the Agricultural-and-Applied-Economics-Association (AAEA)
AB  - Although many studies analyzed effects of sustainability standards-such as Fairtrade or Rainforest Alliance-on smallholder farmers in developing countries, most did not sufficiently account for systematic differences between certified and noncertified farmers. Certified farmers are typically organized in cooperatives. When sampling only from a small number of cooperatives, as previous studies did, it is not easy to disentangle certification effects from possible cooperative effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by randomly sampling from a large number of cooperatives, thus better capturing existing institutional heterogeneity. In particular, we collect and use data from cocoa farmers in Cote d'Ivoire who are organized in Fairtrade-certified and noncertified cooperatives. Regression models with instrumental variables show that Fairtrade has positive and significant effects on cocoa yields, prices, and living standards. These effects remain significant also after controlling for cooperative characteristics, but the magnitude of the estimates changes. We draw two conclusions. First, in Cote d'Ivoire, Fairtrade certification benefits farmers economically. Second, and more generally, cooperative characteristics are jointly correlated with certification and relevant outcomes, which needs to be accounted for to avoid bias when evaluating the benefits of sustainability standards in the small farm sector.

TI  - Collective action in a smallholder oil palm production system in Indonesia: The key to sustainable and inclusive smallholder palm oil?
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Indonesian smallholder oil palm generally yield much less than corporate plantations.. We analysed a smallholder oil palm production system in West Sumatra which outperformed its nucleus estate plantation, consistently producing yields far above the national average for over 25 years. Its institutional setup allowed farmers to combine the advantages of smallholder and plantation agriculture by capitalizing on collective action. Collective action design principles (Ostrom, 1990; Cox, 2010) are used to assess the institutional setup of a smallholder production system. This case study demonstrates that with a strong institutional arrangement, smallholder oil palm farmers can participate in supply chains on advantageous conditions and substantially increase productivity, thereby contributing to both rural development and land sparing.

TI  - Local Agency in Development, Market, and Forest Conservation Interventions in Lao PDR's Northern Uplands
T2  - SOUTHEAST ASIAN STUDIES
AB  - Themes of inclusion, empowerment, and participation are recurrent in development discourse and interventions, implying enablement of agency on the part of communities and individuals to inform and influence how policies that affect them are enacted. This article aims to contribute to debates on participation in rural development and environmental conservation, by applying a structure-agency lens to examine experiences of marginal farm households in three distinct systems of resource allocation in Lao PDR's northern uplands-in other words, three institutional or (in)formal structures. These comprise livelihood development and poverty reduction projects, maize contract farming, and a national protected area. Drawing on qualitative data from focus group discussions and household surveys, the article explores the degree to which farmers may shape their engagement with the different systems, and ways in which agency may be enabled or disabled by this engagement. Our findings show that although some development interventions provide consultative channels for expressing needs, these are often within limited options set from afar. The market-based maize system, while in some ways agency-enabling, also entailed narrow choices and heavy dependence on external actors. The direct regulation of the protected area system meanwhile risked separating policy decisions from existing local knowledge. Our analytical approach moves beyond notions of agency commonly focused on decision-making and/or resistance, and instead revisits the structure-agency dichotomy to build a nuanced understanding of people's lived experiences of interventions. This allows for fresh perspectives on the every-day enablement or disablement of agency, aiming to support policy that is better grounded in local realities.

TI  - Agricultural carbon sequestration, poverty, and sustainability
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper explores the potential impacts of payments for agricultural soil carbon sequestration on poverty of farm households and on the sustainability of agricultural systems, using economic theory combined with evidence from three case studies in Kenya, Peru, and Senegal. The case studies indicate that the likely impact of carbon contracts will be to raise rural incomes and reduce the rate of soil carbon loss. In some cases, carbon contracts may be able to stabilize soil carbon stocks at a higher level than would otherwise be economically feasible. These findings suggest that carbon payments could have a positive impact on the sustainability of production systems while also reducing poverty. The analysis indicates that payments for environmental services are most likely to have a positive impact when they are implemented in an enabling economic and institutional environment.

TI  - How Are Smallholder Farmers Involved in Digital Agriculture in Developing Countries: A Case Study from China
T2  - LAND
AB  - Digital transformation in agricultural practices may lead to a "digital divide" between small and large farms, owing to the characteristics and availability of digital technology. This paper sought to use a case study in Chongzhou County, Sichuan Province in China, to analyze how smallholder farmers in developing countries access such digital agriculture and share the benefits of digital agricultural transformation. Small farmers may own a larger scale farm through forming cooperatives; they are also indirectly involved in digital agriculture through agriculture outsourcing. The outsourcing market is expected to grow, which will allow for the evolution of a digital agricultural service platform, the development of a digital agricultural business organization consortium, and the continued expansion of a healthy digital ecology. This paper revealed important policy implications, stemming from the fact that the implementation of inclusive digital agriculture relies on two key shifts: (1) transformation from land scale operations to service scale operations and (2) from inclusive technological progress to inclusive organization innovation.

TI  - Seeds network and collective action for the restoration and conservation of Xingu River's springs (Mato Grosso, Brazil)
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
AB  - In 2017, indigenous and non-indigenous people from the Xingu-Araguaia region met in Mato Grosso to celebrate 10 years of partnership and collective action of the Xingu Seeds Network (XSN). This network originated from the Campaign 'Y Ikatu Xingu, a social phenomenon concerning conservation and protection of the Xingu spring region. The river basin of the Xingu headwaters, 17 million hectares. is the main focus of XSN and it has lost five million hectares of forests and cerrados, which were converted into grain monoculture fields, within a very short period of time. The impact on the quality of the river water caused an environmental and health problem for the indigenous peoples of the indigenous lands. XSN has promoted innovative technological alternatives for recovery of permanent preservation areas (PPAs) or gallery forest and income generation for small farmers and local communities. The goal of this study is to analyze the environmental governance in the Xingu basin, paying particular attention to institutional arrangements of the Xingu Seeds Network. This analysis is grounded on the theoretical-methodological framework, contained in the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD), which offers tools for understanding the strengthening process of democratic institutions in the protection of common-pool resources. These are permanent preservation areas, in Brazilian case. This study provides a reflection of governance mechanisms, based on the "Commons Theory", in regions where socioeconomic dynamics drastically modify the tropical ecosystems that are fundamental to wildlife and human life.

TI  - The Marketization of Rural Collective Construction Land in Northeastern China: The Mechanism Exploration
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The transfer of rural collective construction land into the market (RCCL marketization) is an important starting point for breaking the urban-rural dual system, realizing the sustainable use of land resources and promoting the integrated development of urban and rural areas in China. This study aims to explore the decision-making of rural households in the marketization of rural collective construction land (RCCL) by constructing a two-stage (cognition-decision) theoretical framework. Based on the household survey data collected from the pilot areas in the three northeastern provinces in China, the structural equation modelling (SEM) has been applied. The main findings are as follows: (1) the four types of exogenous latent variables, including information dissemination, management of collective economic organizations (CEOs), family characteristics, and household head characteristics, are intermediary by household cognition, which then positively affect households' behavior and decision-making. (2) among the factors affecting household cognition, the management of CEOs exhibits the most significant impact, followed by information dissemination, family characteristics, and household head characteristics. (3) the measurable variables, including participation rights, whether there are collective operating assets, education level, and whether members have social insurance, have significant effects on the four exogenous latent variables. (4) the understanding of income distribution policy has the greatest positive impact on household cognition, while risk perception has the opposite effect, indicating an obvious "risk aversion" tendency for rural households. The findings imply that the government should improve the existing RCCL market entry system from the aspects of strengthening collective economic organization construction, land value-added income sharing mechanism, and clarifying rural land property rights, so as to reduce farmers' decision-making risks and enhance value perception. Overall, the research presented here contributes to investigating the theoretical mechanism of household decision-making and providing empirical evidence on how to improve the marketization of rural collective construction land in China.

TI  - Governance structure and performance of mariculture Sci-Tech parks: Evidence from Zhejiang Province, China
T2  - MARINE POLICY
AB  - Mariculture Sci-Tech parks promote modern mariculture and help improve China's mariculture industry. A park consists of a core area and a radiation area. The core area includes a farm, a cooperative, or a company, and the radiation area consists of many small farmers. Stochastic frontier analysis is employed to analyze the performance and its influencing factors of different governance structures in mariculture Sci-Tech parks. Results indicated the following: 1) Core areas show diminishing returns of scale, indicating that the increase in the scale of mariculture production can decrease the output. 2) The average technical efficiency of the core area is 0.4728, with the large family farms having the highest (0.4907), followed by the mariculture companies (0.4777) and the fish farmer cooperatives (0.4499). Several reasons can explain the difference in technical efficiency. First, family farms can better apply the new technology and new varieties to the mariculture production through moderate scale management. Second, companies have a higher operating cost, and the construction of mariculture Sci-Tech park has little effect on companies' performance. Third, cooperatives' advantage is not obvious in the organization management and the repeated construction of the infrastructure decreases utilization. 3) When the radiation area is considered, the input of large family farms has the most significant impact on the performance of the entire Sci-Tech park, with the highest driving efficiency. However, the cooperatives' driving efficiency is very poor, and the company performance is only reflected in the capital investment.

TI  - Cooperative grassland management practices promoted by land tenure system transformation benefit social-ecological systems of pastoralism on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - China has recently implemented the latest rural land tenure reform with the "Separating Three Property Rights" as non-tradable land ownership, non-tradable land contracting right and tradable land use right, leading to a dramatic change in grassland management strategies in vast pastoral areas. However, the impact of this new reform on grassland management practices is widely debated by scholars and policy analysts. To identify the factors impacting the pastoralists' choice of grassland management practice and the social, economic and ecological benefits derived from different grassland management practices, we conducted a field survey of pastoralists (n = 259) in 7 counties on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that respondents' gender, grassland area, scale and location of the village, grassland condition perception significantly exerted positive influence on pastoralists' willingness to participate in cooperative grassland management practices, while grassland fence and urban life expectation negatively influenced the willingness. We found that cooperative grassland management practices led to significantly higher household incomes, more equal gender relationships and better-managed grasslands than individual ones. In spite of this, there were still a large number of pastoralists who chose individual grassland management practices due to their long-term customary operations. In conclusion, this new rural land tenure reform has facilitated pastoralists' choice for diverse grassland management practices and the promoted voluntary large-scale cooperative grassland management practices benefit the social-ecological system of pastoralism.

TI  - A political ecology of socio-economic differentiation: debt, inputs and liberalization reforms in southwestern Burkina Faso
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEASANT STUDIES
AB  - This paper builds on work from the agrarian change and political ecology literatures to analyze the process of agrarian change among smallholder cotton farmers in southwestern Burkina Faso. Specifically, we use a rural survey of 72 heads of household in three villages to examine whether and how (1) access to agricultural inputs, (2) debt and (3) liberalization reforms combine to produce rural socio-economic differentiation based on wealth. We find that wealthier farmers use more mineral fertilizer and manure inputs than their poorer counterparts. Wealthier farmers are also better able to remain debt-free as cotton prices drop and input prices rise. Moreover, they are able to take advantage of the neo-liberal restructuring of cotton cooperatives to change polices on debt repayment and input provisioning to their favor. This growing divide has large implications for rural food security, particularly as land becomes scarcer, fallows disappear and the need to intensify production grows. This research addresses two gaps in the agrarian change literature in relating how liberalization reforms and biophysical elements drive rural socio-economic differentiation. This work also shows that merging the concerns of political ecology with the agrarian change literature allows for a deeper examination of rural socio-economic differentiation.

TI  - Production Risks, Risk Preference and Contract Farming: Impact on Food Security in India
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES AND POLICY
AB  - This article reviews the literature on contract farming (CF) in India and assesses the impact of smallholders' perceived production risks on the adoption of CF; the impact of CF on smallholders' food security; and its impact on employment generation in their farming enterprises. We also show the impact of the outcome variables by risk preference of smallholders. Using farm-level data and endogenous switching regression methods, this study presents three key findings. First, the perception of weather and pest risk, access to irrigation facilities, extension visits, and access to institutional credit are the main drivers of CF adoption. Second, CF adoption increases food security and varies with the revealed risk preference of smallholders, and risk-seeking smallholders tend to gain higher food security. Third, regardless of revealed risk preferences, smallholders who did not adopt CF benefit from adoption by reducing their labor requirements, with no significant losses in yield.

TI  - Tradeoffs, synergies and traps among ecosystem services in the Lake Victoria basin of East Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - Lake Victoria is a crucial ecosystem for over 25 million people in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi who live in the basin, and for the greater Nile river system downstream of the lake. Ecosystem management in the Lake Victoria basin has been highly extractive for most of the last 60 years, with the 1990s a period of marked decline in food production, economic contraction, rising poverty, increased burden of human disease, and more frequent floods. Lake Victoria itself is becoming eutrophic, with related problems of species extinctions and invasive species. There is evidence of poverty-environment traps: some households and areas appear to be caught in vicious cycles of low income, low investment in soil management, declines in soil fertility, and soil loss, while other households and areas are able to achieve higher incomes and investments, maintain soil fertility, and conserve soil on their farms.
   Concepts and approaches from the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) were applied in a study of ecosystem service tradeoffs, synergies and traps in two of the river basins that flow into Lake Victoria from Kenya (Yala and Nyando). Hydrologic units are the main geographic unit used in the analysis, with predictions of sediment yield serving as the main measure of regulating services. Provisioning services are evaluated through a spatially disaggregated analysis of agricultural production, yield and area that combines spatial data from aerial photographs with division-level price and yield estimates.
   The results illustrate considerable year-to-year variation in land use, agricultural production and sediment yield in the two basins. While overall production appears to be relatively stable at the basin level, there have been shifts in the geographic locus of production toward the upper parts of both basins. A spatial overlay of production and sediment yield indicates that different parts of the basins exhibit tradeoffs, synergies and traps. Results from this study have multiple uses in rural planning, agricultural investment, and watershed management. The results also suggest that the poverty traps conceptual framework may help to enrich the interpretative content of the MA approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of farming system and yield in the life cycle assessment of Jatropha-based bioenergy in Mali
T2  - ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Jatropha has been promoted in sub-Saharan Africa as a smallholder energy crop promising additional revenue and energetic self-sufficiency. In this case-study located in Southern Mali we performed a comparative life cycle assessment shedding light on the influence of smallholder participation and yield fluctuations on the global warming potential, fossil resource depletion and energy demand of jatropha-based rural electrification in comparison to a fossil fuel-based reference. We found that the global warming potential of jatropha-based electrification can be 13% higher to 20% lower than fossil diesel, depending on the yield. In terms of energy use and fossil fuel depletion, jatropha is more favourable than fossil-based electricity. In either perspective, the activities related to cultivating and processing grain from small farmers accentuate the environmental impacts, owing to low yields. We conclude that outgrower engagement in tending and harvesting jatropha is a key factor for improving the environmental performance of the system. (C) 2014 International Energy Initiative.

TI  - An Exploration of Decision-Making Processes on Infant Delivery Site from the Perspective of Pregnant Women, New Mothers, and Their Families in Northern Karnataka, India
T2  - MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL
AB  - This study was conducted to explore the decision-making processes regarding sites for delivery of infants among women, their husbands, and mothers-in-law in a rural area of northern Karnataka state, south India. Qualitative semi-structured, individual in-depth interviews were conducted in 2010 among 110 pregnant women, new mothers, husbands and mothers-in-law. Interviews were conducted by trained local researchers in participants' languages and then translated into English. Decisions were made relationally, as family members weighed their collective attitudes and experiences towards a home, private or public delivery. Patterns of both concordance and discordance between women and their families' preferences for delivery site were present. The voice of pregnant women and new mothers was not always subordinate to that of other family members. Still, the involvement of husbands and mothers-in-law was important in decision-making, indicating the need to consider the influence of household gender and power dynamics. All respondent types also expressed shifts in social context and cultural attitudes towards increasing preference for hospital delivery. An appreciation of the interdependence of family members' roles in delivery site decision-making, and how they are influenced by the socio-cultural context, must be considered in frameworks used to guide the development of relevant interventions to improve the utilization and quality of maternal, neonatal and child health services.

TI  - Intensification and intrahousehold decisions: Fertilizer adoption in Burkina Faso
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
CP  - Conference on Structural Transformation of African Agriculture and Rural Spaces (STAARS)
AB  - In most West African countries, agricultural production is a complex process that involves multiple household members managing land and sharing agricultural inputs. We develop an intrahousehold decision-making model to illustrate how technology adoption can influence bargaining processes on farms in harsh agricultural environments of West Africa, where staple food production by extended families is organized collectively under the leadership of a senior head. The head, who assumes primary responsibility for household food security, also allocates fields to members who manage production individually. Drawing on this and the intrinsic complementarity of labor and fertilizer as divisible inputs, we test the nature of the linkage between fertilizer use on collective and individual plots by applying bivariate probit and tobit models to nationally-representative, panel data from Burkina Faso. We find evidence of input sharing, though bargaining is inadequate to sustain efficient allocation of fertilizer. Plot manager characteristics that influence bargaining power, such as literacy, gender, age, contact with extension, and membership in farmer organizations differ between collectively- and individually-managed plots-confirming the differential status of household members in technology adoption. Agroforestry practices are strongly and positively associated with fertilizer use, regardless of plot manage type. Programs aimed at increasing use of modern agricultural inputs should consider impacts on bargaining positions within the household. Providing inputs to women and young men will increase their influence on other decisions, which may lead to greater equity within the household. It may also enhance efficiency in production, since currently, inputs are not allocated efficiently within the household. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Water security and rural household food security: empirical evidence from the Mzinyathi district in South Africa
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - This paper aimed to investigate the determinants of water security in an irrigation scheme, and how this water security level subsequently affects the farmer's household food security level. Water security refers to access by the irrigating households to sufficient and reliable water to meet the agricultural needs and their ability to assert the water rights against other parties. A random sample of 185 irrigating households was interviewed in Tugela Ferry Irrigation Scheme in Mzinyathi District, South Africa. Data were analysed using principal component analysis and ordinary least squares. The empirical results indicated that factors such as farmer's age, off-farm income, farmer association membership, use of pumps, location on the upper-end of the canal and training increase household water security. Conversely, factors such as occurrence of conflicts and location at the tail-end of the canal were found to decrease household water security. This study highlights the importance of strengthening farmer organisational capacity and local institutions for enhancing the water security status of farmers in smallholder irrigation schemes. The results also indicated that perceived water security has a positive impact on household food consumption per adult equivalent. Therefore, for better impact on household food security, the study recommends that priority should be placed in ensuring household water security, not just investing in the physical irrigation scheme and irrigation participation. The human and social dimensions need to receive priority. Training farmers in collective water governance and water conservation techniques to improve water-use efficiency as well as introducing motorised pumps would take irrigators a long way in enhancing their water security.

TI  - Strengthening agroecological resilience through commons-based seed governance in the Philippines
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The Filipino agricultural sector is exposed to multiple climatic, economic, and social risks that will likely intensify in the near future. Building agroecological resilience has been proposed to protect small-scale farmers' livelihoods and improve food security in the context of (unexpected) shocks and disruptions, and slow system changes such as climate change. This paper argues that commons-based seed production, based on collective management and ownership of seeds and varieties, can play a central role in building resilience capacities in smallholder communities. I explore this by applying an indicator-based framework to assess the contribution of the Filipino farmer network Magsasaka at Siyentipiko para sa Pag-unlad ng Agrikultura (MASIPAG) to agroecological resilience. I find that the networks' commons-based seed governance builds agroecological resilience in various ways. By equipping small-scale farmers with the tools to regain control over seed production and breeding, they become stewards of an actively evolving collection of varieties. The in situ maintenance and development of traditional, open-pollinated varieties and a network of diversified trial and backup farms build up buffering capacities and foster agrobiodiversity and local adaptation. A focus on regionally available natural resources reduces vulnerabilities to external factors. Adaptive capacities are strengthened through a high degree of flexibility and responsiveness achieved by self-organization and polycentric organizational structures. Broad participation, shared learning and spaces for experimentation support the development of farmers' capacities to respond to diverse challenges. Commons-based approaches to seed governance can thus strengthen agroecological resilience and long-term food security in smallholder agricultural systems.

TI  - Covid-19, Living income differential and decline in income of cocoa producers in Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB  - Cocoa farmers in Cote d'Ivoire are mostly below the poverty line. In September 2019, the Ivorian and Ghanaian governments imposed the Living Income Differential (LID) on private companies, an additional $ 400 per ton compared to the international market price, passed on to the producer price (farm gate price). At the beginning of 2020, the Covid-19 arose. In this dual context, how did prices change? Has the hope of increased income been achieved? Three approaches are used: a) monitoring of the selling price of cocoa beans and monitoring of the price of purchased cocoa farming inputs and basic necessities for households; b) monthly monitoring of farm gate cocoa price in 2020-2021; c) an analysis of national production data from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana, the world price, variations in the demand for beans by the grinding industry, and the price paid to producers, over 20 years. The first result is a very temporary and limited rise in the farm gate price of cocoa at the end of 2020, then its fall in 2021 as the price of inputs and basic necessities soar. The 2021-2022 campaign is even more harmful with a tightening of the price scissor. It is therefore the failure of the LID, but the role of Covid-19 in this failure is very nuanced with regard to the declarations of the State and the multinationals. The drop in prices and the loss of income for cocoa farmers in 2020-2022 rather fits into the economic theory of games. Without control of their supply, an agreement between two companies or countries cannot work. The failure is part of a largely endogenous structural change: demographic growth, policies to encourage migration and deforestation, opacity of the sector and finally continued growth of the supply of cocoa from Cote d'Ivoire on the international market.

TI  - Understanding the Resilience of Swidden Agroecosystems Interacting with Rubber and Oil Palm Production Regimes in the Philippines
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Currently, smallholder farmers in the Philippines and elsewhere are being engaged in the production of rubber and oil palm for global consumption. Among these smallholder farmers are indigenous peoples who continue to practice traditional forms of swidden agriculture. There is then a propensity for emerging agro-industrial production regimes to increasingly interact with and affect traditional swidden agroecosystems. In this article, we endeavor to explore the application of the resilience concept in analyzing and comparing the persistence of swidden agroecosystems enmeshed in globally integrated agro-industrial production in the province of Palawan, the Philippines. Drawing from six months of ethnography, we compare the resilience of swidden agroecosystems interacting with rubber and oil palm production regimes using indicators developed specifically to evaluate the social and ecological resilience of agroecosystems. Our findings suggest that swidden agroecosystems interacting with rubber production indicate greater resilience as compared to those with oil palm. This difference can be attributed to the greater tolerance of the rubber production regime to swidden agriculture, as well as the regime's more flexible production management systems. However, we caution that any plans of the rubber production regime to follow the oil palm contract model may result in the decline of resilience of swidden agroecosystems in rubber-producing communities.

TI  - Does It Pay to Participate in Decision-making? Survey Evidence on Land Co-management in Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Member participation in decision-making is a critical part of resource co-management. However, little is known about the welfare consequences of participation. This paper analyzes the impact of cooperative member participation in decision-making on their incomes, using data from 364 members of China's land cooperative program. We distinguish two levels of participation in decision-making voting and obtaining financial information and use a bivariate probit model and propensity score matching to estimate their impact. The results indicate that household head's age, gender and education and family size, wealth, and political affiliation determine participation in decision-making. Participation in either voting or obtaining financial information has a positive impact on cooperative members' land income. There is also a strong joint effect of voting and obtaining information, with an increase in land income of > 16%. We conclude that broad participation can ensure more equitable access to land income for members.

TI  - Local food security impacts of biofuel crop production in southern Africa
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - Biofuels have been promoted as a renewable energy option in many countries, but have also faced extensive scrutiny over their sustainability. Food security is perhaps the most debated sustainability impact of biofuels, especially in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa that experience high rates of malnutrition and have been a major destination for biofuel-related investments. This study assesses the local food security impacts of engagement in biofuel crop production using a consistent protocol between multiple crops and sites. We use standardized metrics of food security related to dietary diversity and perceptions of hunger, and focus on feedstock smallholders and plantation workers in four operational projects: a large-scale jatropha plantation (Mozambique), a smallholder-based jatropha project (Malawi) and two hybrid sugarcane projects (Malawi, Eswatini). Collectively these reflect the main feedstocks, modes of production and land use transitions related to biofuel projects in SubSahara Africa. Inverse Probability Weighting analysis indicates that involvement in sugarcane production improved household food security for plantation workers and feedstock smallholders. Conversely, involvement in jatropha production does not have a statistically significant positive effect on household food security for both workers and smallholders. Regression models indicate that the factors driving food security indicator levels vary between study sites. Wealth indicators influence food security indicators in several sites, but the absolute level of income plays a smaller role, while income stability/regularity, access to credit and stable markets for selling sugarcane be important drivers as indicated by the strong effect of proxy variables on indicators.

TI  - Influence of Rural Out-Migration on Household Participation in Community Forest Management? Evidence from the Middle Hills of Nepal
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Rural out-migration was a rare socio-economic phenomenon when community forestry began in the 1980s in Nepal. Now, out-migration significantly influences nearly every aspect of rural livelihoods in the country. However, it is unclear how out-migration affects community forestry governance, which is essential for sustainable rural development. Therefore, this paper addresses the following research question: Does rural out-migration affect forest users' participation in community forestry decision-making and management practices? This paper draws on data collected from an extensive survey of 415 households from 15 community forest user groups in 2 Mid-Hill districts of Nepal. The research used ordered-logit regression to model the impacts of out-migration on participation in forest management and decision-making, while controlling for a number of other socio-economic factors. The model results show that total household size and number of internal migrants, together with multiple resource characteristics and institutional attributes, were major factors affecting participation in decision-making and forest management. However, the number of international migrants did not have a significant role in determining the levels of the participation. This study provides valuable insights for future community forestry policymaking that aims to address the effects of out-migration on community forest management in Nepal.

TI  - Endogenous, Intra-household Decision-making and its Impact on the Labor Supply of Couples in Rural India*
T2  - ASIAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL
AB  - Using data for rural India, this paper analyzes households' labor supply decision-making, taking into consideration non-participation, endogenous intrahousehold bargaining and nutritional status. Analyses of unitary and collective models suggest that bargaining between household members forms the basis of households' decisions, and these decisions alter households' internal power balance. Analysis of households' internal bargaining process suggests that women's bargaining power increases when their wages are higher and they are better educated. The results indicate that it is crucial to account for the mechanics of decision-making within households when studying the effects of changing labor market conditions or designing development policies to improve individual well-being or to empower women.

TI  - Farmers' Awareness and Factors Affecting Adoption of Rapid Composting in Mekong Delta, Vietnam and Central Luzon, Philippines
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - A survey of 417 respondents and focus group discussions among selected farmers were conducted in four villages in Mekong Delta, Vietnam and Central Luzon, Philippines. Key informants interviews among representatives of current adoptors of rapid composting, local authorities, agricultural extension offices, cooperatives, farmers' associations, women's groups, and other related institutional organizations in the study sites were also done. The study aimed to: a) determine the current practices of rice straw uses of the farmers in the study sites; b) describe fanners' awareness and perception about using rice straw to produce rapid compost with Trichoderma; and c) determine the factors affecting the acceptance of farmers to do rapid composting.
   Farmers in the survey areas have low awareness on the use of Trichoderma for rapid composting. The logit model showed that household income and perceptions about rapid composting were significant factors affecting the acceptability of using Trichoderma for rapid composting both in Mekong Delta and Central Luzon. Farm size was another significant factor in Central Luzon. To enhance farmers' adoption of rapid composting the following recommendations are forwarded: 1) capability building of farmers; 2) develop stable supply system of Trichoderma and other activators; and 3) conduct of on-farm trials with both farmers and researchers doing the experiment.

TI  - Insights into the Cocoa and Forests Initiative: Smallholder Engagement with Certification Programs and Agroforestry
T2  - SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
AB  - The Cocoa and Forests Initiative (CFI) in Cote d'Ivoire aims to address forest loss associated with cocoa cultivation by reducing deforestation and encouraging agroforestry. This study explores the relationship between certification programs, which operate primarily through cooperatives, and agroforestry to better understand the environment in which smallholder cocoa farmers operate. This study employs qualitative interviews and quantitative survey data to investigate farmer perceptions of certification programs and agroforestry initiatives and the impact of certification on participation in such initiatives. Farmers widely practiced low levels of agroforestry, about which they held generally positive views, and while certified farmers did not have more agroforestry trees, they were more knowledgeable about the benefits to cocoa production than non-certified farmers. Furthermore, many certified farmers conflated certification with cooperative membership. Understanding the role of preexisting institutions like certification and cooperatives is essential for the successful implementation of the CFI in a smallholder context.

TI  - Do Spouses Realise Cooperative Gains? Experimental Evidence from Rural Uganda
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We use experimental data from variants of public good games to test for household efficiency among married couples in rural Uganda. Spouses frequently do not maximise surplus from cooperation and perform better when women are in charge of allocating the common pool. Women contribute less to this household common pool than men and opportunism is widespread. These results cast doubts on many models of household decision making. Experimental results are correlated with socio-economic attributes and suggest that assortative matching improves household efficiency. Developing non-cooperative household models sensitive to the context-specificity of gender relations emerges as a promising future research agenda. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sequential pegboard to support small farmers in cotton pest control decision-making in Cameroon
T2  - CROP PROTECTION
AB  - A method (SPID) based on sequential plan for individual decision with a pegboard was tested over the 2006 and 2007 cropping seasons in 15 cotton producing villages in Cameroon - covering almost 700 farmers and 2000 ha to help farmers decide on when to spray their cotton crops against bollworms. This method was promoted through training sessions, from researchers to farmers through the technical staff of the cotton company (SODECOTON). This innovation led to a significant reduction in the number of sprays in 5 village-years out of 17 (total number of villages for 2006 and 2007). The number of sprays was larger than in the calendar-based programme in nine village-years, mainly due to poorly controlled infestations of Diparopsis watersi (Rothschild). However, this larger number of sprays led to a greater (seven village-years) or equal (two village-years) seed-cotton yield than that obtained with the calendar-based programme. When the number of sprays was equal or smaller, seed-cotton yield was greater (two village-years) or equal (six village-years) to LPD. Lastly, income increased proportionally to seed-cotton yield. An analysis of decisions made by farmers using the pegboard, as well as an a posteriori evaluation test, showed that users successfully learned the method and were confident in its diagnosis. This new method is not hampered by the constraints experienced with the former LEC ('targeted staggered control') spraying decision method - sequential sampling reduces the number of plants to be monitored, spraying decisions are made for individual plots, income rises and the role of supervisors is reduced. However, large-scale dissemination of this innovation is being hampered by the collective management of cotton production and the need to train a large number of farmers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Commercial agriculture for food security? The case of oil palm development in northern Guatemala
T2  - FOOD SECURITY
AB  - Development practitioners and policymakers often posit that promoting cash crop expansion to generate rural employment has the potential to alleviate poverty and improve food security. Focusing upon the recent expansion of oil palm production in the northern lowlands of Guatemala, we critically evaluate this claim. To do so, we draw upon survey data collected in two neighbouring villages - one where oil palm is the main land use, another where maize and secondary forest are prevalent - to investigate how the expanding cultivation of the cash crop shapes local food access and rural livelihoods. We find that oil palm has improved food access for some households with oil palm employment. However, number of beneficiaries is relatively small and the practice does not lift them from the ranks of the food insecure. For most households in the village where oil palm is prevalent, the ability to access food has decreased, as the expansion of oil palm has displaced staple grain production and eliminated relatively more inclusive forms of agricultural employment. In contrast, households from the village where staple maize production remains predominant are notably more food secure. We conclude that, in the absence of deep changes that address the underlying causes of widespread vulnerability in Guatemala's northern lowlands, the self-provisioning of maize and other staples will continue to serve as a cornerstone of food security, while the promotion of cash crops like oil palm will exacerbate inequalities in households' ability to access food.

TI  - Migrant decision-making in a frontier landscape
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Across the tropics, rural farmers and livestock keepers use mobility as an adaptive livelihood strategy. Continued migration to and within frontier areas is widely viewed as a driver of environmental decline and biodiversity loss. Recent scholarship advances our understanding of migration decision-making in the context of changing climate and environments, and in doing so it highlights the variation in migration responses to primarily economic and environmental factors. Building on these insights, this letter investigates past and future migration decisions in a frontier landscape of Tanzania, East Africa. Combining field observations and household data within a multilevel modeling framework, the letter analyzes the explicit importance of social factors relative to economic and environmental factors in driving decisions to migrate or remain. Results indeed suggest that local community ties and non-local social networks drive both immobility and anticipated migration, respectively. In addition, positive interactions with local protected natural resource areas promote longer-term residence. Findings shed new light on how frontier areas transition to human dominated landscapes. This highlights critical links between migration behavior and the conservation of biodiversity and management of natural resources, as well as how migrants evolve to become integrated into communities.

TI  - Property, access, exclusion: Agribusiness venture agreements in the Philippines
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Economists have touted partnerships between smallholders and agribusiness firms that cultivate high-valued export crops as a means of raising smallholder incomes and achieving rural development. However, some case studies show that such partnerships can deny smallholders the ability to benefit from their lands. This essay examines how this dynamic occurs by comparing the experiences of agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs) in the Davao Region of the Philippines. The paper finds that contracts which deny ARBs the benefit of their holdings are those that deprive them of key abilities such as determining who can use land and withdraw it from a partnership. Such contracts arise when ARB groups lack attributes that enhance their capacity for collective action, information gathering, and legal advocacy.

TI  - Estimating the economic and production efficiency of cotton growers in Southern Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - CUSTOS E AGRONEGOCIO ON LINE
AB  - Considering the contraction of land under cotton cultivation in Pakistan due to low economic incentives, the present study is intended to estimate the cost and revenue along with different factors affecting the cotton production in southern Punjab. The primary data from 480 cotton growers was collected by adopting a multistage random sampling technique in person interviews by using a well-designed pretested questionnaire. The cost-benefit ratio was calculated by estimating the total production cost, total revenue, net farm income, and gross margins. The present study applied data envelopment analysis to evaluate the technical, allocative, and cost-efficiency of the cotton farmers. The second stage regression analysis was also conducted to explore the factor affecting cotton production by using the Cobb-Douglas production function. The regression results revealed that farming experience, education, land preparation cost, and irrigation cost has a positive impact on total revenue, whereas, chemicals and fertilizers cost showed a negative effect. According to BCR, medium farmers obtained 1.27 by investing one rupee in cotton production followed by large and small farmers 1.11 and 1.07, respectively. The results suggested that there is a dire need to fill the gap between extension workers and cotton growers. Moreover, the agriculture department should guide and train the farmers about the optimum utilization of inputs to reduce the production cost.

TI  - Agroforestry Practices in Livelihood Improvement in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Agroforestry plays a significant role in increasing agricultural productivity. In South Africa, there is a pressing need for promoting smallholder agriculture to promote sustainable rural livelihoods, to ensure food security, to lower inflation in food prices, and address rampant rural unemployment in the country. The agricultural economy is characterised by a monopoly structure where almost every single staple in South Africa is already produced by large manufacturers that can produce it at better quality and lower cost than the average smallholder enterprise or cooperative. Such a monopoly structure fundamentally undermines the development of local markets, where local small-scale producers sell to their local community. The novelty of this study is addressing the research gap that conventional rural livelihood analyses often neglect, i.e., the role of environmental products in general, and forest and agroforestry products. Using a log linear regression model with cross-sectional data collected from a sample of 300 households, this study explores the likely impact of agroforestry practices in promoting the livelihood of rural communities in the study areas. Results obtained from multiple linear regression analysis showed that average household income increased as a function of utilization of agroforestry practices. Agroforestry contributes to sustainable rural livelihoods in South African provinces where the predominant means of livelihoods is rural subsistence farming and agriculture. Since valuation of agroforestry products and services are technically difficult, farmers often underestimate the contribution of agroforestry to the household's livelihood income. These findings have policy implications in promoting food security in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa and beyond.

TI  - Do Certification Schemes Enhance Coffee Yields and Household Income? Lessons Learned Across Continents
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - While the market for sustainably certified products grows, the debate on whether smallholder farmers benefit from this certification movement is far from over. We present empirical findings across three continents. Identical household surveys were conducted among 738 smallholder coffee farmers organized in primary cooperatives in Ethiopia, India and Nicaragua. The comparative analysis which is based on the propensity score matching approach shows that the impacts of Fairtrade certification on coffee yields and income vary across countries. In Ethiopia, the coffee farmers from Fairtrade certified cooperatives fare worse than their non-certified counterparts both in coffee yield and income. In the Indian case study, the Fairtrade cooperative members have yield and price advantages over the non-certified farmers. This has in turn led to higher net revenue from coffee for certified farmers. In Nicaragua, coffee farmers from Fairtrade and double (Fairtrade-Organic) certified cooperatives also benefit in terms of net revenue but there is no statistically significant effect on yield and household income. A comparison of the Fairtrade minimum floor price and the weight-equivalent Fairtrade cooperative price in the three countries shows that Nicaraguan Fairtrade certified farmers have obtained a higher average price than the Fairtrade mandated minimum price, whereas in Ethiopia the certified farmers received a much lower price. In India, the certified average price was closer to the minimum floor price. We conclude that coffee cooperatives and the motivation and capability of their staff play a central role in training their member farmers about each aspect of coffee growing and certification.

TI  - Rural Women's Access to Credit: Market Imperfections and Intrahousehold Dynamics
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Credit rationing Studies carried out at the household level and based on responses from male heads of households present ail incomplete and biased assessment of who is likely to be constrained, why they are constrained, and what is the extent of the constraints. They ignore possibly conflictive intrahousehold dynamics and assume that imperfections in rural financial markets are gender-neutral. This paper addresses both issues theoretically and empirically. The Semi-Cooperative Household model developed for this analysis formalizes the conditions under which spouses', and particularly women's, individual access to credit can be affected by their own position in the financial market its well as by intrahousehold dynamics. These notions are then explored empirically using husbands' and wives' individual perceptions of their access to credit in rural Paraguay. The most significant empirical findings of the paper are that (i) compared to men. women are more likely to be credit constrained (ii) women's rationing status responds to a different set of factors than men's; and (iii) husbands may choose not to intermediate capital to their wives even when they are able to do so. Results from this exercise provide empirically sound support for the assumptions underlying women-targeted credit programs. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

But the label of "WUA" indicates little about those who take on these duties as association members, suggesting all who use water in pursuit of life or livelihood are eligible to participate and benefit through collective action. Grounded in the belief that participatory projects can equitably empower and distribute resources, the enthusiastic introduction of WUAs continues despite critique that anticipated outcomes are overstated. Since borders opened to neoliberal development institutions in the 1990s, WUAs have been created throughout post-Soviet Central Asia. Yet, there has been limited reflection on how associations' design and operation interact with physical or social structures to effect resource access across diverse groups. Drawing on fieldwork in Tajikistan, I demonstrate how WUAs reproduce exclusionary outcomes by requiring members to possess farmland in turn threatening rural food security. Held by a minority, farmland dedicated to commercial production stands in contrast to ubiquitous kitchen gardens, where crops sown for self-consumption form a buffer against hunger in the wake of labor migration and income inconsistency. Households' inability to become members undermines their claim to water and voice in decision-making, ultimately constraining access to irrigation and a robust harvest.

TI  - Community control of resources and the challenge of improving local livelihoods: A critical examination of community forestry in Nepal
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - Community forestry in Nepal vests rights of access, use, exclusion, and management of national forestland to local user groups. There is strong potential for community forests to serve as the basis for improving the quality of life and the status of livelihoods in rural Nepal while conserving forest resources. Frequently, community forest user groups are dominated by local elites who choose to close access to community forestland for several years. As a result, forest conditions are improving, but the poorest households bear the cost of strict protection. In this paper I argue that community forestry is thus having rather limited success at improving rural livelihoods. Although community forestry is fairly successful at conservation, there remain huge wealth disparities between community forest member households, limited access to vital forest products, and significant power disparities within community forest user groups. Such conditions of inequity, reinforced by current community forestry policy and practice, severely challenge the development potential of community-controlled natural resources. In Nepal, overcoming these challenges may require a change in policy that mandates more inclusive local decision-making. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Institutional bricolage (re)shaping the different manifestations of state-citizens relations in Mekong hydropower planning
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - Concerns over hydropower development in the Mekong River Basin and elsewhere include not only the overall impacts of dams on basin ecology and economy but also more site-specific impacts on affected communities. While hydropower development is impacting the livelihoods of local communities living along the river, the latter's views and concerns are often sidelined by top-down hydropower planning. Nonetheless, local commu-nities create and shape their political spaces of engagements in relation to hydropower decision making across scales, albeit through various means and with different results. Taking the planned Pak Beng hydropower dam as a case study and building on the concept of institutional bricolage, we look at: 1) local communities' responses in Thailand and Laos, including how these are influenced by social movements; 2) how these responses are translated into collective action (or the lack thereof), including in relation to local communities' (in)ability to negotiate better compensation for their to be impacted livelihoods; and 3) how local communities strategies are embedded in the wider political context and different manifestations of state-citizens relations. We argue that while affected farm households can pursue their interests to secure proper compensation through individual means, this leads to sub-optimal outcomes for affected communities collectively.

TI  - Profitable partnerships: smallholders, industry, eucalypts and acacias in Asia
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY
AB  - Smallholder tree-growers make substantial contributions to commercial wood flows in many countries in Asia. Many of these growers choose eucalypt and/or acacia species, which offer profitable and sustainable land-use options. Smallholder acacia and eucalypt plantings in India, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Sri Lanka, China, Thailand and Viet Nam are discussed, and data are presented to show the magnitude of these resources. In each country, smallholder plantings form critical raw-material inputs for numerous processors, with the collective scale of their wood production exceeding 86 million m(3) annually and worth over USD 2.4 billion annually directly to these growers. Such harvests are major contributors to the livelihoods of smallholder families and to the economic viability of numerous local wood-using industries that rely on the raw materials they generate. This paper describes the profitable partnerships in Asia between smallholder tree-growers and their eucalypts and acacias, discusses their species of choice and the consequences of such decisions, and explores how and why these partnerships have developed and endured.

TI  - The productivity and income effects of adoption of improved soybean varieties and agronomic practices in Malawi
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Soybean constitutes an important component of the maize-based smallholder cropping systems in Malawi and holds considerable potential for countering soil fertility decline, enhancing household food and nutrition security, and raising rural incomes. A number of yield-enhancing improved soybean varieties and agronomic practices (ISVAPs) have been developed and disseminated in Malawi, but there is limited evidence on the adoption and impacts of these technologies. This paper assesses the productivity and income effects of adopting ISVAPs using plot level data collected from a nationally representative sample of 1237 soybean growing households in Malawi. Our results show that over a third of the sampled households have adopted ISVAPs. Furthermore, results from a stochastic dominance analysis showed that soybean yields and net crop incomes for adopters are significantly higher than those of non-adopters over the entire probability distribution of ISVAPs adoption. Endogenous switching regression model results further demonstrated that adoption of ISVAPs is associated with an average of 61% yield gain and 53% income gain for adopters. Overall, the results point to the need for further scaling of ISVAPs for greater adoption and impact on the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Malawi. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fairness and Efficiency in Smallholder Farming: The Relation with Intrahousehold Decision-Making
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - Agricultural households face collective action dilemmas when making decisions about investments in their common household farm and the allocation of resources and benefits derived from it. We relate intrahousehold decisions, as measured in a lab-in-the-field experiment conducted with spouses in agricultural households in western Uganda, with actual investments and intrahousehold resource allocation. Intrahousehold decision-making that supports cooperation and equitable sharing is associated with greater investment in the intensification of cash and food crop production, and more equitable access and control over income. Freeriding behaviour by husbands is associated with the intensification of cash crop production, but not with equitable sharing.

TI  - A bigger piece of a very small pie: Intrahousehold resource allocation and poverty reduction in Africa
T2  - DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
AB  - Feminist research has convincingly shown that an increase in household income does not necessarily lead to improvement in the well-being of all members of the household. More questionable is the policy conclusion often drawn from this research for rural Africa: redressing gender imbalance in control of productive resources will significantly reduce poverty. This contribution argues that the evidence and analysis presented by two studies repeatedly cited to show that gender inequality is inefficient are problematic. It is mythical to suggest that tinkering with women's market position by exchanging unequal collective rights to productive resources for individual ones will decisively reduce rural poverty in Africa. That will depend on the restructuring of long-term and deeply unequal processes of integration in the market, not on a firmer insertion of women within existing patterns of individualization and commodification of productive resources.

TI  - Impact of the coronavirus pandemic on financial returns of smallholder coffee plantations in Lao PDR
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Laos is among the top twenty coffee producing country in the world-producing about 39,000 tonnes per year-and most of its production is currently exported to over 26 countries, contributing about 1.1% of the total export value or US$64.3 million in 2019 to Laos' national economy. COVID-19 restrictions on trade and movement of people have largely impacted on coffee markets and production. As a strategic crop in Laos, it is supported by a range of policies and programs to generate greater benefits to both independent smallholder farmers and those involved in cooperatives, including support for agroforestry production models involving coffee and tree crops. However, studies of the profitability of different coffee agroforestry models are limited. This study compares financial returns from four most popular coffee agroforestry models in two coffee production provinces of Laos, before and during COVID-19 pandemic. The data were gathered from 20 farmers, five coffee traders and an integrated coffee processing company. These data were then triangulated with, and supplemented by, interviews with coffee exporters (n = 3) and key informants (n = 4). Financial indicators suggest that all four agroforestry models were profitable before COVID, but profits for cooperative growers were higher than for smallholders due to higher crop productivity and lower costs. Despite higher prices due to COVID restrictions, other factors reduced profitability of all four models and one smallholder model became unprofitable. The reasons for such differences and related policy implications are discussed.

TI  - Effect of Technological Innovation on Gender Roles: The Case of Fruit Fly IPM Adoption on Women's Decision-Making in Mango Production and Marketing in Kenya
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - An increase in returns from agriculture as a result of new or improved technology is often perceived to escalate women's loss of control over agricultural production and ability to make marketing decision due to persistent gender disparities in access to production resources. The International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) and partners have developed integrated pest management (IPM) technology to suppress mango fruit flies on smallholder mango farm in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite the impressive direct economic impacts of the technology, no study has been conducted to determine whether it has any impact on intra-household gender roles in mango production and marketing decision-making. Using a sample of 470 mango-growing households from Machakos County, we employed a two-limit Tobit difference-in-differences model on the women's decision-making index to examine the impact of IPM technology adoption on intra-household decision-making in mango production and marketing activities. The results showed a decrease of 21.2% in the women's decision-making index due to the adoption of IPM technology. The index can be enhanced through women's access to training by extension officers, increased formal education, and direct intervention for women to increase their investment in mango production.

TI  - Facilitating Earthquake-Affected Rural Women Communities Toward Sustainable Livelihoods and Agriculture
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Women open school participatory learning approach was used to build up the capacity of 1055 rural women of selected earthquake-affected areas of Balakot, district Mansehra, Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province of Pakistan in kitchen gardening and off-season vegetable cultivation, integrated pest management, pesticide risk reduction, poultry and livestock management, health and hygiene, and income-generating approaches. Community-based collective learning was found to be effective for changing rural women's perception about pesticides, role in agriculture, home, and contribution to household income as well as in decision making. It also improved knowledge, awareness, confidence, self-awareness, agricultural practices, social interactions, and enhanced motivation for revival of livelihood.
